Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a directory contains a Python file with the same name as the directory (e.g., directory 'a' contains 'a.py'), Pylint incorrectly tries to find an `__init__.py` file and fails.
- This issue affects both direct linting of the module and import resolution when the module is imported by other files.
- The problem is resolved by either renaming the file or adding an `__init__.py` file.

2. Cause Analysis:
- When Pylint encounters a directory 'a' with a file 'a.py', it appears to incorrectly interpret this as a package structure requiring an `__init__.py` file.
- This seems to be a module resolution issue where Pylint's import checker is confusing a single module file with a package of the same name.
- The core issue likely lies in how Pylint resolves module paths and determines whether something should be treated as a package vs. a single module.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes by File:

```
pylint/epylint.py
function: lint
```
This function is relevant as it handles the initial path traversal and module resolution for linting.

```
pylint/checkers/imports.py
class: ImportsChecker
function: _get_first_import
```
These are relevant as they handle import resolution and validation, which is part of the core issue when the module name matches its parent directory.

```
pylint/lint/pylinter.py
class: PyLinter
```
This class is relevant as it's the core linting controller that coordinates module resolution and checking.

For the remaining files:
```
pylint/interfaces.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
pylint/typing.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue primarily involves module resolution and import checking, which is handled by the functions and classes identified above. The interfaces and typing files define supporting structures but aren't directly involved in the problematic behavior.
