Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to use '\p{Han}' in a regular expression pattern within the pylintrc configuration file. The regex pattern is meant to match Chinese characters (Han script) in function names, but it throws a "bad escape \p" error.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because Python's built-in re module doesn't support Unicode property escapes (\p{Han}) by default. This is a feature that's available in some other regex engines but requires special handling in Python. The error is happening during the configuration parsing stage when Pylint tries to compile the regular expression pattern.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

pylint/checkers/misc.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

pylint/config/arguments_manager.py:
```
pylint/config/arguments_manager.py
class: PyLinter
```
This class is relevant as it handles configuration parsing and would be involved in processing the regex patterns from the config file.

pylint/config/config_initialization.py:
```
pylint/config/config_initialization.py
function: _config_initialization
```
This function is relevant as it's responsible for initializing configuration and would be involved in processing the pylintrc file where the problematic regex pattern is defined.

pylint/lint/pylinter.py:
```
pylint/lint/pylinter.py
class: PyLinter
```
This class is relevant as it's the main linter class that processes configurations and would be involved in handling regex patterns.

pylint/lint/run.py:
```
pylint/lint/run.py
class: Run
```
This class is relevant as it's the entry point for running pylint and would be involved in the initial setup and configuration processing.

The issue appears to be primarily in the configuration parsing stage, where the regex pattern is being compiled without proper handling of Unicode property escapes. The fix would likely need to be implemented in the configuration parsing logic within these components.
