Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The current xarray.concat requires users to manually handle datasets with different variables by either:
- Creating dummy variables filled with NaN in datasets that don't have certain variables
- Dropping mismatched variables entirely
This behavior is not user-friendly and differs from pandas.concat which automatically handles mismatched variables through outer join.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the concatenation logic where:
- There's no automatic handling of missing variables between datasets
- The concat operation requires strict variable matching
- There's no built-in option to automatically create and fill missing variables with NaN values
- The join behavior doesn't follow pandas-style outer join for variables

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

xarray/core/combine.py:
```
xarray/core/combine.py
function: _auto_concat
function: concat_dim
function: combine_nested
```
This file contains functions related to combining datasets, particularly _auto_concat which handles the core concatenation logic and could be modified to support automatic handling of missing variables.

xarray/core/concat.py:
```
xarray/core/concat.py
function: concat
function: _dataarray_concat
function: _dataset_concat
```
This file contains the main concatenation functions that would need to be modified to support automatic handling of missing variables and implement pandas-style outer join behavior.

xarray/core/merge.py:
```
xarray/core/merge.py
function: merge_core
function: merge_coords
function: merge_collected
```
This file contains the core merging logic that would need to be enhanced to better handle variable mismatches during concatenation operations, particularly in merge_core which could implement the outer join behavior for variables.

The fix would likely require modifications across these functions to implement proper handling of missing variables during concatenation, similar to pandas' outer join behavior.
