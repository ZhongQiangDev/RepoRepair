Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
When using `DataSet.update` to update a chunked dask DataArray, the DataArray loses its chunking after the update operation. The example shows that `foo` starts as a chunked array, but after `ds.update(update_dict)`, it is no longer chunked.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the update operation handles dask arrays. When creating the update dictionary and performing the update, the chunking information is being lost, likely because:
- The slicing operation (`ds.foo[1:, :]`) may not properly preserve chunking information
- The update operation may not properly handle or preserve the chunking attributes when merging the data

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

xarray/core/alignment.py:
```
xarray/core/alignment.py
function: align
function: broadcast
function: deep_align
```
These functions are relevant as they handle data alignment during updates and need to preserve chunking information.

xarray/core/computation.py:
```
xarray/core/computation.py
function: apply_ufunc
function: apply_array_ufunc
class: IndexingSupport
```
These are relevant as they handle array operations and need to properly support dask arrays and chunking.

xarray/core/indexing.py:
```
xarray/core/indexing.py
class: DaskIndexingAdapter
class: LazilyOuterIndexedArray
class: LazilyVectorizedIndexedArray
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle dask array indexing and need to preserve chunking information.

xarray/core/merge.py:
```
xarray/core/merge.py
function: dataset_update_method
function: merge_core
```
These functions are central to the issue as they handle the update operation that's losing the chunking information.

xarray/core/variable.py:
```
xarray/core/variable.py
function: as_variable
class: Variable
```
These are relevant as they handle the underlying data representation and need to properly preserve chunking information when converting or updating data.

The issue likely stems from a combination of these components not properly preserving or propagating the chunking information during the update operation, particularly in the interaction between the indexing system and the merge/update functionality.
