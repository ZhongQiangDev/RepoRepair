Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The DatasetGroupBy text representation includes a trailing whitespace at the end of the first line when displayed. This is evident in both interactive Python sessions and when converting the object to a string:
```python
>>> ds.groupby("letters")
DatasetGroupBy, grouped over 'letters' 
2 groups with labels 'a', 'b'.
```
Note the space after 'letters' in the first line.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the string representation logic of DatasetGroupBy objects. The trailing whitespace is likely being added during the string formatting of the object's representation, either in the __repr__ or __str__ method. This causes conflicts between flake8's trailing whitespace checks and doctest's exact string matching requirements.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

xarray/core/common.py:
```
xarray/core/common.py
class: DataWithCoords
```
This class is relevant as it contains the base groupby functionality that DatasetGroupBy inherits from.

xarray/core/formatting.py:
```
xarray/core/formatting.py
function: array_repr
function: dataset_repr
```
These functions are relevant as they handle the string representation of xarray objects, including grouped objects.

xarray/core/groupby.py:
```
xarray/core/groupby.py
class: GroupBy
class: DatasetGroupBy
```
These classes are directly relevant as they implement the groupby functionality and its string representation where the trailing whitespace issue occurs.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The most likely location of the issue is in the GroupBy class's __repr__ method in groupby.py, where the string representation is constructed with an unintended trailing whitespace.
