Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to perform a roundtrip operation of stacking and unstacking variables in a Dataset. Specifically, when using `to_stacked_array` followed by `to_unstacked_dataset` on variables with a single dimension, a MergeError is raised indicating conflicting values for variable 'y'.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in the merging logic when unstacking the data. When dealing with single-dimension variables, the unstacking operation is failing to properly handle the coordinate merging, leading to conflicts in the 'y' variable. This suggests an issue in either the stacking/unstacking implementation or the underlying merge operations that handle coordinate alignment.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

xarray/core/coordinates.py:
```
xarray/core/coordinates.py
class: Coordinates
class: DataArrayCoordinates
class: DatasetCoordinates
```
These coordinate handling classes are relevant as they manage how coordinates are processed during stacking/unstacking operations.

xarray/core/dataarray.py:
```
xarray/core/dataarray.py
class: DataArray
```
This class is relevant as it's involved in the stacking/unstacking operations and coordinate handling.

xarray/core/dataset.py:
```
xarray/core/dataset.py
class: Dataset
function: merge_coords
function: merge_core
```
These are relevant as they handle the merging of coordinates during unstacking operations, which is where the error occurs.

xarray/core/merge.py:
```
xarray/core/merge.py
function: merge_collected
function: merge_coordinates_without_align
class: MergeError
```
These are directly related to the merging error being encountered during the unstacking operation.

xarray/core/variable.py:
```
xarray/core/variable.py
class: Variable
class: IndexVariable
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the underlying data structures that are being stacked and unstacked.
