Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that after upgrading to Sphinx 3.3, warnings are being generated stating "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" when building either singlehtml or latex output formats.

2. Cause Analysis:
The warning suggests that tables in the documentation are not being properly numbered or assigned reference numbers. This is likely related to the table numbering system in Sphinx, particularly in the LaTeX writer and table processing components. The issue appears when tables should be numbered but the numbering system is failing to assign numbers properly.

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

sphinx/directives/patches.py:
```
sphinx/directives/patches.py
class: CSVTable
class: ListTable
class: RSTTable
```
These table-related classes are relevant as they handle table processing and may affect table numbering.

sphinx/domains/std.py:
```
sphinx/domains/std.py
class: StandardDomain
```
This class is relevant as it handles enumerable nodes including tables and their numbering.

sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sphinx/transforms/references.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sphinx/writers/latex.py:
```
sphinx/writers/latex.py
class: LaTeXTranslator
class: Table
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the translation of tables to LaTeX format and may be involved in table numbering during the LaTeX output generation.

The most likely source of the issue is in the interaction between StandardDomain's handling of enumerable nodes (tables) and the table processing classes (CSVTable, ListTable, RSTTable), with the final output being affected in the LaTeX writer components. The warning suggests that the numbering system for tables is not properly connecting these components.
