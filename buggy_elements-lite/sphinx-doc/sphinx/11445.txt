Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When rst_prolog is set in the configuration and a document contains a domain directive (like :mod:) as the first heading, the heading is not rendered correctly and is not included in the toctree. However, if either condition is not met (no rst_prolog or no domain directive in heading), the heading displays correctly.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how rst_prolog interacts with domain directives in headings. When rst_prolog is prepended to the content, it likely interferes with the parser's ability to properly recognize and process domain directives that appear at the beginning of section titles. This suggests the problem lies in either:
- How rst_prolog is prepended to the content
- How the parser handles domain directives in section titles
- How titles are collected and processed for the toctree

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

sphinx/parsers.py:
```
sphinx/parsers.py
class: RSTParser
```
This class is relevant as it handles the parsing of RST content and specifically deals with rst_prolog preprocessing.

sphinx/util/rst.py:
```
sphinx/util/rst.py
function: prepend_prolog
```
This function is directly relevant as it handles how rst_prolog is added to the document content.

sphinx/environment/collectors/title.py:
```
sphinx/environment/collectors/title.py
class: TitleCollector
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for collecting and processing document titles, which are not being properly handled in this case.

sphinx/domains/std.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sphinx/directives/other.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between prepend_prolog() and how RSTParser processes the modified content, affecting how TitleCollector identifies and processes the titles. The domain directive in the heading is probably being affected by the prolog insertion, causing the parser to fail to recognize it as a proper heading.
