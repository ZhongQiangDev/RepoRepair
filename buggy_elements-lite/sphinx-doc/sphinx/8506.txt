Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Sphinx documentation system is rejecting valid command-line option syntax in the form `[enable=]PATTERN`. Sphinx 3.2 considers this malformed and expects options to match specific patterns like "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", "/opt args" or "+opt args".

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how Sphinx validates command-line option syntax. The error suggests that Sphinx 3.2 introduced stricter validation rules for the `option::` directive, which now rejects option formats that don't match a predefined set of patterns. This is particularly problematic for documenting software that uses non-standard option formats.

3. File Analysis:

sphinx/parsers.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/registry.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/directives/code.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/directives/other.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/domains/std.py:
```
sphinx/domains/std.py
class: Cmdoption
class: OptionXRefRole
class: StandardDomain
```

The issue is primarily related to the `Cmdoption` class in the std domain, which handles the parsing and validation of command-line options. This class appears to be enforcing strict validation rules through its `handle_signature` method. The `OptionXRefRole` and `StandardDomain` classes are also relevant as they work together to process and manage command-line option documentation.

The validation logic in `Cmdoption` class is likely using too restrictive patterns to validate option syntax, causing it to reject valid but non-standard option formats like `[enable=]PATTERN`. This is a change from previous versions which were more permissive in accepting various option formats.
