Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when `struct.Struct` is used in type annotations, Sphinx's autodoc fails to resolve it properly, showing the error "class reference target not found: Struct". However, other similar type annotations like `pathlib.Path` work correctly.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that Sphinx's autodoc system is not properly handling the `struct.Struct` type when processing type annotations. While it can handle some standard library types like `pathlib.Path`, it fails to recognize `struct.Struct`. This suggests there might be issues in:
- How type annotations are parsed and processed
- How cross-references are resolved for built-in types
- How the Python domain handles module-level classes from the standard library

3. Relevant Functions/Classes by File:

```
sphinx/domains/python.py
function: builtin_resolver
class: PyXRefRole
```
This file contains relevant code as it handles Python domain references and built-in type resolution. The `builtin_resolver` function is directly responsible for resolving built-in types, and `PyXRefRole` handles cross-references in Python documentation.

```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py
class: AutodocDirective
```
This file is relevant as it handles the core autodoc functionality and processes directives that generate documentation from Python code.

```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
function: record_typehints
function: merge_typehints
```
This file is relevant as it handles the processing of type hints in documentation. Both functions are involved in extracting and formatting type annotations.

```
sphinx/util/typing.py
function: stringify
```
This file is relevant as it handles the conversion of type annotations to strings for documentation purposes. The `stringify` function is directly involved in processing type annotations.
