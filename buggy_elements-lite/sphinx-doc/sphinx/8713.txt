Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that the napoleon extension handles the "Other Parameters" section differently from the "Parameters" section. Specifically, when `napoleon_use_param` is True, the "Parameters" section uses the `:param:` and `:type:` roles format, but the "Other Parameters" section always uses a different format regardless of this setting.

2. Cause Analysis:
Looking at the code snippet in the problem description, we can see that while `_parse_parameters_section` checks the `napoleon_use_param` config value and uses different formatting based on it, `_parse_other_parameters_section` doesn't check this config value at all. It always uses `_format_fields` without considering the `napoleon_use_param` setting.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sphinx/config.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py:
```
sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py
class: GoogleDocstring
class: NumpyDocstring
```

sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py:
```
sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py
class: Config
```

The issue is primarily in the docstring parsing logic within the napoleon extension. The `NumpyDocstring` and `GoogleDocstring` classes contain the actual parsing logic for docstrings, including the problematic `_parse_other_parameters_section` method. The `Config` class in napoleon/__init__.py is also relevant as it defines the `napoleon_use_param` configuration option that controls this behavior.

The core of the issue lies in these classes, particularly in their docstring parsing methods. The fix would need to modify how the "Other Parameters" section is processed to respect the `napoleon_use_param` configuration setting, similar to how the regular "Parameters" section does.
