Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The RangeSlider widget fails to initialize with user-provided initial values, throwing an IndexError when trying to access index 4 of an array that only has 4 elements.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the RangeSlider's set_val method when trying to set the initial polygon vertices. The code attempts to access xy[4] but the polygon only has 4 vertices (indices 0-3). This appears to be an off-by-one error in the polygon vertex handling code.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/widgets.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/widgets.py
class: RangeSlider
```

This is the only relevant class since:
1. The error occurs specifically in RangeSlider's set_val method
2. The issue is with the initialization of RangeSlider widget values
3. The bug is in the polygon vertex handling code within RangeSlider

The other classes in the file are not directly related to this specific RangeSlider initialization issue. The error is contained within the RangeSlider class implementation, specifically in how it handles the polygon vertices during value setting.

The bug appears to be a leftover line of code that tries to set a fifth vertex (xy[4]) when the polygon only needs and has four vertices. This line should be removed or commented out as suggested in the bug report.
