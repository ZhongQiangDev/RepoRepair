Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to set a LogNorm to an existing colorbar's mappable after the colorbar has been created. The code fails with a "ValueError: Invalid vmin or vmax" error, despite explicitly setting valid vmin and vmax values for LogNorm.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that when updating the norm of an existing plot with a colorbar, the normalization validation is failing. This likely happens because:
- The colorbar needs to be updated when its associated mappable's norm changes
- The vmin/vmax validation in LogNorm is not properly handling the transition
- The ScalarMappable's update mechanism may not be properly propagating the new norm settings

3. Relevant Functions/Classes by File:

```
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
class: ScalarMappable
```
This class is directly relevant as it handles the normalization and color mapping, including norm updates.

```
lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py
class: Colorbar
```
This class is relevant as it manages the colorbar and needs to respond to changes in the associated mappable's normalization.

```
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
class: LogNorm
class: Normalize
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the normalization process and validation of vmin/vmax values. The LogNorm class is specifically involved in the error.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The issue appears to be in the interaction between these components when updating the norm of an existing plot, particularly in how the new normalization parameters are validated and propagated through the ScalarMappable to the Colorbar.
