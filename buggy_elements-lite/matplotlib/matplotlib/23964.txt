Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When saving a figure with the PostScript backend, a TypeError occurs when trying to unpack a NoneType object. This happens specifically when a text label (either through annotate or title) contains an empty line at the beginning ('\nLower label').

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that somewhere in the PostScript backend's text handling code, there's an issue with processing text that starts with a newline character. The code is likely trying to unpack or process a value that has become None due to improper handling of empty lines in text.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: annotate
```
This function is directly related as it's used in the reproduction code to create the annotation that triggers the error.

lib/matplotlib/text.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/text.py
class: Text
class: Annotation
```
These classes handle text rendering and annotations, which are central to the issue since it involves text label processing.

lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py
class: RendererPS
function: quote_ps_string
```
This is the PostScript backend renderer where the error likely occurs during text processing. The quote_ps_string function is responsible for converting text strings into PostScript-compatible format.

The error is likely occurring in the RendererPS class when it attempts to process the text with an empty line, and quote_ps_string may be involved in the string conversion process that's failing.

The issue appears to be in the text processing pipeline where an empty line at the start of the text is not being handled correctly, resulting in a None value being returned where a tuple was expected.
