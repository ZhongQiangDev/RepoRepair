Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that a UserWarning is being generated about incompatible layout engines when using `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight'`, even when `constrained_layout=False` is explicitly set. This warning should not appear when constrained layout is disabled.

2. Cause Analysis:
The warning appears to be triggered by an incorrect check of the layout engine state. Even though `constrained_layout=False` is set, the code is still detecting a layout engine conflict. This suggests that either:
- The `constrained_layout` flag is not being properly propagated
- The layout engine compatibility check is not properly considering the `constrained_layout=False` setting
- The warning logic is not properly checking the layout engine state

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/figure.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/figure.py
class: Figure
class: SubplotParams
```
This file contains the core Figure class which handles layout settings and the SubplotParams class that manages subplot parameters. These are relevant because they handle the layout engine settings and subplot adjustments that are triggering the warning.

lib/matplotlib/gridspec.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/gridspec.py
class: GridSpec
```
This file contains the GridSpec class which is relevant as it handles the layout grid and interacts with constrained layout settings.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: subplots
function: subplots_adjust
```
These functions are directly related to the issue as they are the interface functions being called in the problem description that trigger the warning.

The remaining files do not contain functions/classes directly relevant to this layout engine warning issue.

The warning is likely originating from the interaction between Figure's layout management, GridSpec's layout handling, and the pyplot interface functions that coordinate these components.
