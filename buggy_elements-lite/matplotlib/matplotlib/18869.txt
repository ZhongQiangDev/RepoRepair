Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that matplotlib only exposes `__version__` for version information, which makes it difficult to perform version comparisons. This is problematic because string comparisons of version numbers can be unreliable, especially when version numbers reach 3.10 or 4.10 where lexicographic string comparison would give incorrect results.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is the lack of a more structured version information representation in matplotlib's top level namespace. While `__version__` exists, there's no `version_info` tuple (like Python's sys.version_info) or `LooseVersion` instance that would allow for proper version comparisons. This makes it harder to write version-dependent code or compatibility checks.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

setup.py:
```
setup.py
class: BuildPy
```
This class is relevant as it handles the build process and could be modified to include version information generation. The other classes and functions are not directly related to version information handling.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
While this file contains many plotting-related functions, none are related to version information handling.

lib/matplotlib/rcsetup.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
This file focuses on runtime configuration and parameter validation, with no direct connection to version information handling.

The solution would likely involve:
1. Adding a new version_info tuple or LooseVersion instance in the top-level matplotlib namespace
2. Modifying the BuildPy class to generate this information during package installation
3. Ensuring the version information is properly exposed in the package's __init__.py file (which isn't shown in the provided files)
