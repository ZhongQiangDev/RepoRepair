Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`. This causes problems like `plt.close(fig2)` not working because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find the figure anymore.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be related to figure management and context handling in matplotlib. When a figure is created within an `rc_context`, it seems the figure reference is not properly maintained after calling `get_backend()`. This suggests there may be an issue with how figures are tracked and managed across different runtime configuration contexts.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: close
function: figure
function: gcf
```
This function is relevant because it's directly mentioned in the bug report that `plt.close(fig2)` fails. The close function interacts with the figure management system that's exhibiting the bug.

This function is relevant because it's involved in creating new figures, which is a key part of the reproduction steps where figures are created both inside and outside the rc_context.

This function is relevant because it's used to get the current figure and interacts with the `Gcf` management system that's losing track of figures.

lib/matplotlib/style/core.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/style/core.py
function: context
```
This function is relevant because it's related to the `rc_context` functionality where the bug manifests when creating figures.

The other functions and classes in the provided files don't appear to be directly relevant to this specific bug, as they deal with other aspects of matplotlib like plotting, styling, and visualization that aren't involved in the figure management and context handling issue described.
