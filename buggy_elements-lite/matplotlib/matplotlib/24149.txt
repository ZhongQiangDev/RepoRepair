Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `ax.bar` function raises a StopIteration exception when passed all-nan data in matplotlib 3.6.1. This breaks seaborn's histogram function which relies on drawing and removing a "phantom" bar to handle color cycling.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the `_convert_dx` method when trying to find the first finite value in an array of NaN values. The function `_safe_first_finite` raises StopIteration when it cannot find any finite values in the input sequence. This happens because:
- The bar function tries to convert width values using `_convert_dx`
- `_convert_dx` calls `_safe_first_finite` to get a reference value
- When all values are NaN, no finite value can be found, causing StopIteration

3. Relevant Functions/Classes:

```
lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py
function: bar
function: _convert_dx
```

```
lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py
function: _safe_first_finite
```

```
lib/matplotlib/container.py
class: BarContainer
```

The other files in the Relevant Files Information do not contain functions or classes directly related to this issue. The problem stems from the interaction between the bar plotting function, its width conversion helper, and the safe finite value finder utility.

The key locations are:
1. The bar function which initiates the plotting
2. The _convert_dx function which processes width values
3. The _safe_first_finite function which fails to handle all-NaN input
4. The BarContainer class which manages the bar plot elements

These components need to be modified to properly handle cases where all input values are NaN, likely by adding appropriate checks or fallback behavior before attempting to find finite values.
