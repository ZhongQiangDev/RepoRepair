Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The GitHub issue describes that mixture models in scikit-learn have inconsistent interfaces compared to clusterers, specifically:
- They use `n_components` instead of `n_clusters` parameter
- They don't store `labels_` of training data
- They don't have a `fit_predict` method
- Their documentation is separate from clusterers

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that mixture models were developed independently from the clustering framework, despite serving similar purposes. This has led to:
- Inconsistent parameter naming conventions
- Missing standard clustering interfaces/attributes
- Documentation organization differences

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: ClusterMixin
```
This class defines the standard interface for clustering algorithms, including the `fit_predict` method that mixture models should implement.

sklearn/cluster/hierarchical.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sklearn/mixture/base.py:
```
sklearn/mixture/base.py
class: BaseMixture
```
This is the base class for mixture models that needs to be modified to align with clustering interfaces.

sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py:
```
sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py
class: DPGMM
class: VBGMM
```
These are mixture model implementations that would need to be updated to follow clustering conventions.

sklearn/mixture/gmm.py:
```
sklearn/mixture/gmm.py
class: GMM
class: _GMMBase
```
These classes implement Gaussian mixture models and would need to be modified to align with clustering interfaces, including adding `labels_` attribute and `fit_predict` method.

The key locations for changes would be in the mixture model base classes and implementations to make them conform to the clustering interface standards defined in ClusterMixin.
