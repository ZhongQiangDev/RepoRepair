Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when using SVM with sparse data where support_vectors_ is empty. When calling _sparse_fit, it results in a ZeroDivisionError. This happens specifically when converting dense input to sparse format using scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in _sparse_fit when trying to calculate something involving dual_coef_indices.size / n_class. When support_vectors_ is empty, dual_coef_indices.size becomes 0, leading to division by zero. This suggests the code doesn't properly handle the edge case where no support vectors are found during fitting.

3. Examining Files:

sklearn/exceptions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/svm/base.py:
```
sklearn/svm/base.py
class: BaseLibSVM
class: BaseSVC
```
These classes are relevant because they contain the core SVM implementation and the _sparse_fit method where the error occurs.

sklearn/svm/setup.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/utils/extmath.py:
```
sklearn/utils/extmath.py
function: safe_sparse_dot
```
This function is potentially relevant as it handles sparse matrix operations which are involved in the SVM fitting process.

sklearn/utils/multiclass.py:
```
sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
function: check_classification_targets
function: type_of_target
```
These functions are relevant because they handle validation of target variables and could be involved in determining the n_class value that's causing the division by zero.

The most critical location is likely in BaseLibSVM in svm/base.py, as this is where the _sparse_fit method resides and where the division by zero error is occurring. The other identified functions/classes play supporting roles in the process that leads to this error.
