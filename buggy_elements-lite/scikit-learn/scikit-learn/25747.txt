Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using FeatureUnion with a custom transformer that outputs pandas data while having transform_output="pandas" set. The error shows a length mismatch between the expected number of elements (4) and the actual number (96) when trying to set the index.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how FeatureUnion handles pandas output when transform_output="pandas" is set. The error occurs because:
- The custom transformer returns a pandas Series with a different index length (96 hours) than the input DataFrame (4 days)
- When sklearn tries to wrap the output with pandas container, it attempts to use the original input's index, causing the length mismatch
- This only happens with pandas output mode because numpy mode doesn't try to preserve index information

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: TransformerMixin
class: BaseEstimator
```

sklearn/pipeline.py:
```
sklearn/pipeline.py
class: FeatureUnion
function: _fit_transform_one
function: _transform_one
```

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
```

sklearn/utils/_set_output.py:
```
sklearn/utils/_set_output.py
function: _wrap_data_with_container
function: _wrap_in_pandas_container
```

The issue primarily involves the interaction between FeatureUnion's transformation process and the pandas output wrapping functionality. The key components are:

1. TransformerMixin and BaseEstimator which provide the base transformer interface
2. FeatureUnion which handles the parallel transformations
3. The validation and output wrapping functions that process the transformed data
4. The specific wrapping functions for pandas containers that attempt to preserve the original index

These components together create the condition where the index length mismatch occurs when trying to preserve pandas output format.
