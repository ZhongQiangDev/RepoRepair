Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `warn_on_dtype` parameter in `check_array` function has no effect when the input is a pandas DataFrame. Specifically, when converting a DataFrame with object dtype to float64, no warning is issued even though `warn_on_dtype=True` is set.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely occurs because the DataFrame's dtype conversion handling is not properly triggering the warning mechanism in the `check_array` function. When a pandas DataFrame is passed, its dtype conversion may be happening without the proper warning checks that should occur when `warn_on_dtype=True`.

3. File Analysis:

sklearn/exceptions.py:
```
sklearn/exceptions.py
class: DataConversionWarning
```
This class is relevant as it's the warning type that should be raised during dtype conversion.

sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sklearn/utils/fixes.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sklearn/utils/testing.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
```
This is the main function where the issue occurs, as it's responsible for handling the array validation and dtype conversion warnings.

The core issue appears to be in the `check_array` function in validation.py, which should be raising a `DataConversionWarning` when converting DataFrame dtypes. The warning mechanism in this function needs to be properly triggered when handling pandas DataFrame inputs with dtype conversions.
