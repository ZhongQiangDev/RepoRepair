Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The KernelPCA results show inconsistent signs in the output components while the absolute values remain the same. For example:
[-0.44457617] vs [0.44457617] vs [-0.44457617]
The components flip signs randomly between different runs.

2. Cause Analysis:
This is actually expected behavior in PCA/KernelPCA. The sign ambiguity occurs because eigenvectors (principal components) are only determined up to a sign - both v and -v are valid eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue. The absolute values remain consistent because they represent the true structure/variance in the data, while the signs are arbitrary.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

sklearn/decomposition/base.py:
```
sklearn/decomposition/base.py
class: _BasePCA
```
This base class is relevant as it provides core PCA functionality that KernelPCA builds upon.

sklearn/decomposition/pca.py:
```
sklearn/decomposition/pca.py
class: PCA
```
The PCA class is relevant as it implements the core PCA algorithm and handles eigenvector computation.

sklearn/utils/extmath.py:
```
sklearn/utils/extmath.py
function: svd_flip
function: _deterministic_vector_sign_flip
```
These functions are directly relevant as they handle sign flipping of eigenvectors/singular vectors to ensure consistency.

sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py:
This file would be most relevant but is not included in the provided files. It would contain the KernelPCA implementation that exhibits this behavior.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The key functions are svd_flip() and _deterministic_vector_sign_flip() which are designed to handle sign ambiguity, but the issue suggests these may not be being applied consistently in the KernelPCA implementation.
