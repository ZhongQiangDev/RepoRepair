Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that when trying to use Python's slice notation with len(pipe) (i.e., pipe[:len(pipe)]), an error occurs because the Pipeline class does not implement the __len__ method. This means you cannot determine the length of a pipeline object using the built-in len() function.

2. Cause Analysis:
The Pipeline class in sklearn/pipeline.py lacks a __len__ method implementation. This method is needed to support Python's built-in len() function and related slicing operations. The length of a pipeline would naturally be the number of steps in the pipeline, which is stored in the steps attribute.

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

sklearn/multiclass.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/pipeline.py:
```
sklearn/pipeline.py
class: Pipeline
class: FeatureUnion
```
These classes are relevant because:
- Pipeline is the main class that needs the __len__ implementation
- FeatureUnion is a similar composition class that might also benefit from length support

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The Pipeline class in pipeline.py is the primary location that needs modification to implement the __len__ method. The implementation would likely need to return the length of the steps list that stores the pipeline's transformers and estimator. FeatureUnion is included because it has a similar structure with transformer_list and might need similar length support for consistency.
