Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `unique_labels` function raises a ValueError when trying to process pandas nullable dtypes ("Int64", "Float64", "boolean") with the error message "Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}". However, it works fine with standard numpy dtypes ("int64", "float64", "bool").

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue occurs because when pandas nullable dtypes are converted to numpy arrays, they become 'object' dtype instead of their corresponding numeric types. This causes the type checking in `unique_labels` to fail as it sees a mix of binary and unknown types, rather than recognizing them as numeric types.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sklearn/utils/multiclass.py:
```
sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
function: is_multilabel
function: type_of_target
```
This file contains the main functions involved in the issue. `is_multilabel` is where the error occurs, and `type_of_target` is used internally to determine the type of labels.

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
function: _ensure_no_complex_data
```
These functions are relevant as they handle array type checking and conversion, which is part of the process where pandas nullable dtypes are being converted incorrectly.

sklearn/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue primarily involves label type checking and array conversion functions in the multiclass.py and validation.py files. The base.py file's contents are not directly related to the type checking and conversion of label arrays.
