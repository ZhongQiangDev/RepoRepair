Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails when trying to use a float value (3.0) for n_neighbors parameter in NearestNeighbors. The error occurs during the initialization of NeighborsHeap, indicating that the n_neighbors parameter must be an integer, but this validation happens too late in the process.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that there's no early parameter validation for n_neighbors to ensure it's an integer. The error only surfaces when the internal implementation tries to use this value, resulting in a less user-friendly error message. The validation should happen during initialization or parameter setting.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
```
This class is relevant as it handles parameter validation and initialization for all estimators, including NearestNeighbors.

sklearn/neighbors/base.py:
```
sklearn/neighbors/base.py
class: NeighborsBase
class: KNeighborsMixin
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the core neighbor functionality and parameter handling.

sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py:
```
sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py
class: NearestNeighbors
```
This is the main class where the parameter validation should be implemented.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The fix should involve adding parameter validation in either NearestNeighbors.__init__() or NeighborsBase.__init__() to ensure n_neighbors is an integer before proceeding with any operations. This would provide a more user-friendly error message earlier in the process.
