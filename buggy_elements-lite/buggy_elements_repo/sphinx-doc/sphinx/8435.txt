Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration is not being applied to variables and attributes in Python documentation. Specifically, when documenting variables like `var: String` and class attributes like `MyString.var: String`, the type alias defined in conf.py (`'String': 'example.MyString'`) is not being used to resolve the type reference.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how type aliases are handled during the documentation process. The type alias resolution mechanism likely isn't being applied when processing variable and attribute type annotations. This would be related to how the Python domain processes type hints and annotations, particularly for variables and class attributes.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sphinx/domains/python.py:
```
sphinx/domains/python.py
class: PyAttribute
class: PyVariable
class: PythonDomain
```
These classes are relevant because they handle the documentation of Python attributes and variables, including their type annotations. The PythonDomain class would be responsible for managing type aliases.

sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py:
```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
function: record_typehints
function: merge_typehints
function: modify_field_list
```
These functions are relevant as they handle the processing and merging of type hints in the documentation, which would need to respect type aliases.

sphinx/util/typing.py:
```
sphinx/util/typing.py
function: stringify
```
This function is relevant as it's responsible for converting type annotations into strings, which would need to handle type aliases properly.

sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely stems from either the Python domain classes not properly resolving type aliases for variables/attributes, or the type hint processing functions not properly applying the aliases during documentation generation. The fix would need to ensure that type alias resolution is consistently applied across all Python object types, including variables and attributes.
