Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The current man page generation places all generated man pages in a single directory (`<build-dir>/man`), which doesn't conform to the standard Unix `MANPATH` search functionality. The `man` program expects man pages to be organized in section-specific directories like `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the manual page builder's output file organization logic. Instead of creating section-specific subdirectories and placing man pages in their appropriate sections (based on their section number), it's placing all man pages directly in the root man directory. This needs to be modified to create and use the proper section-based directory structure.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sphinx/builders/manpage.py
class: ManualPageBuilder
```
This is the primary class responsible for generating man pages. It handles the output file organization and would need to be modified to create section-specific directories.

```
sphinx/writers/manpage.py
class: ManualPageWriter
```
This class is responsible for writing the man page content and could potentially be involved in determining the output path structure.

```
sphinx/application.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sphinx/cmd/build.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sphinx/environment/collectors/dependencies.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The main changes would need to be made in the ManualPageBuilder class, specifically in its `write` method, to create the appropriate section directories (e.g., man1, man3) and place the generated man pages in their corresponding section directories based on the section number specified in the man page configuration.
