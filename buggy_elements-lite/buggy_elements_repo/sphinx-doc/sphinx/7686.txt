Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The autosummary template variable `members` contains imported members (like `os`) even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False` in the configuration. This results in unwanted imported modules and attributes being included in the generated documentation.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the autosummary extension collects module members without properly respecting the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration setting. When generating documentation for a module, it's including all accessible attributes including imported ones, regardless of the configuration setting that should filter them out.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

sphinx/config.py:
```
sphinx/config.py
class: Config
```
This class is relevant as it handles the configuration settings including `autosummary_imported_members`.

sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py:
```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py
function: get_module_members
```
This function is directly relevant as it's responsible for collecting module members, which should respect the imported members setting.

sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py:
```
sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py
function: generate_autosummary_content
function: generate_autosummary_docs
```
These functions are relevant as they handle the generation of autosummary documentation and need to respect the imported members configuration.

sphinx/util/template.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely lies in the interaction between `get_module_members` and `generate_autosummary_content`, where the filtering of imported members isn't being properly applied based on the configuration setting. The `Config` class is involved as it stores and provides access to the configuration value, but the actual filtering logic needs to be implemented in the member collection and documentation generation process.
