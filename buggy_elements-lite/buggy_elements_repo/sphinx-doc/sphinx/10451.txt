Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using autodoc_typehints with "description" setting. The output shows duplicated *args and **kwargs parameters in the documentation, where they appear twice with incomplete information:
- Once with just the type annotation
- Once with just the description
- Instead of being properly combined into a single entry with both type and description

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how type hints and parameter descriptions are being merged for special parameters (*args and **kwargs). The merging logic is not properly handling these variadic parameters, leading to duplicate entries where the type information and description are split into separate parameter entries instead of being combined.

3. File Analysis:

sphinx/application.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/domains/python.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py:
```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
function: merge_typehints
function: modify_field_list
function: augment_descriptions_with_types
```

sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The key functions involved are in the typehints.py file:
- `merge_typehints`: This function is responsible for merging type hint information into the documentation
- `modify_field_list`: This function handles the actual modification of field lists where the duplication is occurring. It needs to be updated to properly handle *args and **kwargs parameters by combining their type information and descriptions into single entries.

These functions need to be modified to properly handle the special case of variadic parameters (*args and **kwargs) to prevent the duplication and ensure both type information and descriptions are combined correctly.
