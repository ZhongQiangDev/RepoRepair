Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
When rendering a formset's empty_form with form_kwargs containing 'empty_permitted' parameter, a KeyError occurs. This happens specifically when trying to access the empty_form property of a formset where form_kwargs includes either {'empty_permitted':True} or {'empty_permitted':False}.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how empty_form handles form_kwargs. The empty_form is meant to be a template form that shouldn't need validation parameters like empty_permitted, but it seems the empty_permitted parameter is being incorrectly passed or handled when constructing the empty form.

3. File Analysis:

django/forms/forms.py:
```
django/forms/forms.py
class: BaseForm
class: Form
```
These are relevant because they handle form initialization and the empty_permitted parameter.

django/forms/formsets.py:
```
django/forms/formsets.py
class: BaseFormSet
```
This is highly relevant as it handles the empty_form property and form_kwargs passing.

django/forms/models.py:
```
django/forms/models.py
class: BaseModelFormSet
function: modelformset_factory
```
These are relevant because the issue occurs with a ModelFormSet, which inherits from BaseFormSet and is created via modelformset_factory.

django/forms/models.py:
The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely lies in BaseFormSet's handling of empty_form and how it passes form_kwargs to the empty form instance. The form_kwargs containing empty_permitted should either be filtered out or handled differently when creating the empty_form.
