Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The HttpResponse class doesn't properly handle memoryview objects when they are passed as content. Instead of returning the actual content bytes, it returns a string representation of the memoryview object (b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>').

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the content handling logic of HttpResponse. When a memoryview object is passed, it's not being properly converted to bytes before being stored or returned. This is particularly noticeable when working with PostgreSQL's BinaryField which returns data as memoryview objects.

3. Examining Files:

django/core/files/base.py:
```
django/core/files/base.py
class: File
```
This class is relevant as it handles file-like objects and their content, which could be involved in how binary data is processed.

django/core/handlers/wsgi.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/http/request.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/http/response.py:
```
django/http/response.py
class: HttpResponse
class: HttpResponseBase
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle the response content and its conversion/storage. The HttpResponse class is where the memoryview handling issue occurs.

django/middleware/gzip.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely lies in the HttpResponse class's content handling methods, where it needs to properly convert memoryview objects to bytes, similar to how it handles other content types. The File class may also be involved as it deals with file-like objects and content handling.
