Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when the numberformat.py tries to check if a number is negative by accessing str_number[0] to look for a "-" sign, but encounters a null/empty value. This causes an IndexError: string index out of range.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue happens because the code assumes there will always be at least one character in the string representation of the number to check for a negative sign. However, when the number field is null/empty, this assumption fails and causes an index out of range error.

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

django/contrib/admin/exceptions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/contrib/admin/helpers.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/template/response.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/utils/formats.py:
```
django/utils/formats.py
function: number_format
```

django/utils/numberformat.py:
```
django/utils/numberformat.py
function: format
```

The key functions involved are:
1. `number_format` in formats.py - This is the high-level function that handles number formatting and delegates to numberformat.format
2. `format` in numberformat.py - This is where the actual error occurs when trying to check for negative numbers

These functions form the chain where null values are processed for display in the admin interface. The error occurs in the format function when it tries to check the first character of a null/empty string for a negative sign.
