Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The test runner crashes when trying to use the new Django 3.1 feature "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False}. Specifically, it fails with a "relation 'django_admin_log' does not exist" error during database setup, indicating that required database tables are missing.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because when "MIGRATE": False is set, Django skips running migrations during test database creation. However, the system still tries to serialize the database content (including admin logs) before running tests, but the required tables don't exist because migrations weren't run. This creates a conflict between the no-migration setting and the database serialization process.

3. File Analysis:

```
django/db/backends/base/creation.py
class: BaseDatabaseCreation
```
This class is directly relevant as it handles test database creation and contains the serialization logic that's failing. The error occurs specifically in the serialize_db_to_string method when trying to access non-existent tables.

```
django/db/migrations/executor.py
class: MigrationExecutor
```
This class is relevant because it's responsible for executing migrations during test database setup, and the new setting is affecting its behavior.

```
django/db/migrations/loader.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
While this file is part of the migration system, it's not directly involved in the specific issue of test database creation and the MIGRATE setting behavior.

The core issue appears to be in the interaction between BaseDatabaseCreation's serialization process and the new MIGRATE setting, where the system needs to handle the case where tables might not exist when serialization is attempted.
