Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when trying to combine Q objects with Exists objects using the & operator. Specifically:
- `Exists(...) & Q()` works correctly
- `Q() & Exists(...)` raises a TypeError

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to operator precedence and type handling in the combination of Q and Exists objects. The error occurs in Q's `__and__` method, which expects the other operand to be a Q object. When Q is on the left side, its `__and__` method is called, but it doesn't handle Exists objects. However, when Exists is on the left side, Python looks for `__rand__` in Exists to handle Q objects, which appears to be implemented correctly.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/db/models/query_utils.py
class: Q
```
This class is directly involved as it handles the & operator through `__and__` method and fails to properly handle Exists objects.

```
django/db/models/expressions.py
class: Exists
```
This class represents the Exists expression and should implement `__rand__` to handle Q objects properly when it's on the left side of &.

```
django/db/models/expressions.py
class: Expression
```
This is the base class for all expressions including Exists, and may need modifications to support proper operator handling.

The remaining files do not contain directly relevant functions/classes for this specific issue. The problem is primarily centered around the interaction between Q and Exists classes through the & operator, specifically in their operator method implementations.

The fix would likely involve either:
1. Modifying Q's `__and__` method to handle Exists objects
2. Adding `__rand__` to Exists to handle Q objects
3. Modifying the base Expression class to provide default implementations for these operators
