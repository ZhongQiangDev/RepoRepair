Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The syndication framework doesn't directly support adding item comments through the feed.add_item() method. Currently, users have to use item_extra_kwargs to add comments, which is a more roundabout way.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from incomplete implementation in the feed generation system. While the feedparser already has support for comments, the view layer doesn't expose this functionality directly in the add_item() method. This creates an inconsistency between what the parser can handle and what the API exposes to users.

3. File Analysis:

django/contrib/syndication/apps.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/contrib/syndication/views.py:
```
django/contrib/syndication/views.py
class: Feed
```

django/utils/feedgenerator.py:
```
django/utils/feedgenerator.py
class: SyndicationFeed
class: RssFeed
class: Rss201rev2Feed
```

The Feed class in views.py is relevant because it's responsible for handling the feed generation interface that needs to be modified to support comments.

The SyndicationFeed class is the base class that needs to be modified to support the comments parameter in add_item(). The RssFeed and Rss201rev2Feed classes are relevant because they handle the actual implementation of RSS feed generation where comments need to be supported.

These classes form the chain of responsibility for implementing the comments feature, from the high-level interface in Feed down to the actual RSS generation in Rss201rev2Feed.
