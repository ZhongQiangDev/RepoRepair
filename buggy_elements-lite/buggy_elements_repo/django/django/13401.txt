Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when retrieving fields from two different models that inherit from the same abstract model, the fields are considered equal and thus get deduplicated when added to a set. This is unexpected because even though the fields originate from the same abstract model, they belong to different concrete models and should be treated as distinct.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the field comparison logic. Fields from different models are being compared as equal based solely on their creation_counter, without considering which model they belong to. This leads to deduplication when these fields are added to a set, even though they represent different model fields.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/db/models/base.py
class: Model
class: ModelBase
```
These classes are relevant because they handle model inheritance and field management. The ModelBase metaclass is particularly important as it's responsible for setting up fields during model creation.

```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
class: RelatedField
```
This class is relevant as it's a base class for field relationships and contains core field comparison logic that might affect field equality.

```
django/db/models/lookups.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/db/models/fields/proxy.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue primarily involves model field comparison and inheritance handling, which is managed by the Model and ModelBase classes in base.py, along with the RelatedField class that provides core field functionality. The other files, while part of Django's model system, don't directly relate to the field equality comparison issue described in the problem.
