Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Identifying the wrong behavior:
The test case shows that when using FilteredRelation with select_related() in a multi-level relationship, the wrong object is being assigned. Specifically, the test expects p[0].pool.tournament to equal p[0].tournament_pool.tournament, but instead gets a PoolStyle object where a Tournament object should be.

2. Analyzing the cause:
The issue appears to be in how Django handles the combination of FilteredRelation and select_related() when traversing multiple levels of relationships. The wrong object type being returned suggests that the related object population or mapping is incorrect during the query execution and result processing.

3. Examining relevant files:

django/db/models/lookups.py:
```
No relevant functions/classes. This file handles lookup operations but not the core relationship handling.
```

django/db/models/query.py:
```
django/db/models/query.py
class: ModelIterable
class: QuerySet
```
These classes are relevant because they handle how query results are processed and how related objects are populated.

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
class: ForeignObject
class: RelatedField
```
These classes are fundamental to how Django handles relationships between models and could be involved in the incorrect object mapping.

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
class: SQLCompiler
```
This class is relevant as it handles the compilation of queries including select_related() operations and could be involved in how the related objects are retrieved.

django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py
class: Join
```
This class is relevant because it handles how tables are joined in queries, which is crucial for both FilteredRelation and select_related() operations.

The issue likely stems from an interaction between these components, where the Join construction or related object population is not correctly handling the combination of FilteredRelation and select_related() in multi-level relationships.
