Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when filtering on a query result that contains a GROUP BY clause. The GROUP BY clause in the inner query is incorrectly using the wrong column (id instead of email) when the query is used as a subquery filter.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in how Django handles the GROUP BY clause when a query with annotations and GROUP BY is used as a subquery filter. The original query correctly groups by 'email', but when used as a subquery filter, the GROUP BY clause incorrectly switches to grouping by 'id'. This suggests an issue in how the query is transformed or compiled when used as a subquery.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/core/serializers/python.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/expressions.py:
```
django/db/models/expressions.py
class: Subquery
```

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
class: SQLCompiler
```

django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/sql/query.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
class: Query
class: RawQuery
```

The issue likely stems from how Django handles subqueries and GROUP BY clauses. The `Subquery` class in expressions.py is responsible for handling subquery generation, while `SQLCompiler` handles the actual SQL compilation. The `Query` class manages the query construction and transformation. These components work together when a queryset is used as a filter condition, and the bug appears to be in how the GROUP BY clause is handled during this process.

The `RawQuery` class is also potentially relevant as it deals with raw SQL queries and could be involved in how the subquery is ultimately processed.
