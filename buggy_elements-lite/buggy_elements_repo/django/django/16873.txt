Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `join` filter in Django templates is incorrectly escaping the joining string (separator) even when `autoescape off` is explicitly set. This means that when using something like `{% autoescape off %}{{ some_list|join:"<br/>" }}{% endautoescape %}`, the `<br/>` separator is still being HTML-escaped to `&lt;br/&gt;`, while the list items themselves are correctly not escaped.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the `join` filter handles auto-escaping. When `autoescape off` is set, it correctly prevents escaping of the list items but fails to apply the same logic to the separator string. This suggests there's a problem in either the join filter implementation or how it interacts with the auto-escape context.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/template/defaultfilters.py:
```
django/template/defaultfilters.py
function: join
```
This is directly relevant as it's the implementation of the join filter that's showing the incorrect behavior.

django/template/base.py:
```
django/template/base.py
class: FilterExpression
class: Variable
```
These classes are relevant because they handle how filter expressions are evaluated and how variables are resolved in templates, including auto-escape context handling.

django/utils/html.py:
```
django/utils/html.py
function: conditional_escape
```
This function is relevant as it's responsible for determining whether a value should be escaped based on the context.

django/utils/safestring.py:
```
django/utils/safestring.py
class: SafeString
class: SafeData
```
These classes are relevant because they handle the marking of strings as safe/unsafe for HTML rendering.

The remaining files in the 'Relevant Files Information' contain no relevant functions/classes for this specific issue.

The core of the issue likely lies in how the `join` filter in defaultfilters.py handles the separator string, not properly respecting the autoescape context when processing it. The fix would involve modifying the join filter to apply the same auto-escape logic to both the list items and the separator.
