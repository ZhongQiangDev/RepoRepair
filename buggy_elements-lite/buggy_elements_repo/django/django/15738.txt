Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to change a ForeignKey field to a ManyToManyField while also removing a unique_together constraint in a single migration. The error message indicates:
"ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)"

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from trying to perform two incompatible operations in a single migration:
- Converting a ForeignKey to ManyToManyField changes the relationship structure
- Removing unique_together constraint
The migration system is unable to handle these changes simultaneously because:
- The unique_together constraint depends on the ForeignKey field
- Converting to ManyToManyField creates an intermediate table
- The constraint validation fails during the transition

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it detects and generates migration operations, including field changes and constraint modifications.

django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
class: AlterField
class: AddField
class: RemoveField
```
These classes are relevant for handling field type changes and relationship modifications.

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: AlterUniqueTogether
class: AlterModelOptions
```
These classes handle unique_together constraint changes and model option modifications.

django/db/migrations/executor.py:
```
django/db/migrations/executor.py
class: MigrationExecutor
```
This class is relevant as it executes migrations and handles dependencies between operations.

django/db/migrations/migration.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
