Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The inspectdb command generates Django models from existing database tables, but when there are multiple foreign key relationships to the same model, it fails to automatically generate unique related_name attributes. This causes a clash in reverse accessors, resulting in the error E304.

2. Cause Analysis:
When inspectdb creates models with multiple foreign keys pointing to the same model, it doesn't automatically add related_name parameters to differentiate the reverse relationships. This leads to Django trying to create identical reverse accessor names for different fields, causing a naming conflict.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py
class: Command
```
This is the main class responsible for the inspectdb functionality and would need modification to handle related_name generation.

```
django/db/backends/base/introspection.py
class: BaseDatabaseIntrospection
```
This base class provides the foundation for database introspection and would need to be enhanced to collect information about relationships that could be used for related_name generation.

```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
class: ForeignKey
class: RelatedField
```
These classes handle relationship field creation and validation, and would be involved in implementing proper related_name handling.

```
django/db/backends/mysql/introspection.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/introspection.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The backend-specific introspection files don't need modification as they just provide raw database metadata. The changes needed are at the model generation level in the inspectdb command and the base introspection class.
