Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running Django's migrate command with a specific database parameter, the migration itself runs correctly on the specified database
- However, after the migration, there's an unexpected database read operation that ignores the specified database parameter
- This read operation instead tries to use the database router, which causes issues in multi-tenant setups

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to post-migration operations, specifically around Permission handling
- The database router is being invoked after migrations when it shouldn't be
- This suggests that some post-migration signal or callback is making database queries without respecting the specified database parameter
- Based on the error trace showing "read {}" before the exception, it's likely related to the post_migrate signal handlers

3. File Analysis:

```
django/contrib/sites/apps.py
class: SitesConfig
```
This class is relevant because it connects to post_migrate signals and attempts database operations after migrations, which could be part of the problem pattern.

```
django/core/management/commands/migrate.py
class: Command
```
This class is highly relevant as it's the main migration command handler and responsible for executing migrations with the specified database parameter.

```
django/db/utils.py
class: ConnectionRouter
class: ConnectionHandler
```
These classes are relevant because they handle database routing and connection management, which are central to the reported issue.

```
django/db/backends/base/base.py
class: BaseDatabaseWrapper
```
This class is relevant as it's the base database connection wrapper that handles database operations and could be involved in how database parameters are respected or ignored.

```
django/db/migrations/executor.py
class: MigrationExecutor
```
This class is relevant as it executes migrations and could be involved in how database parameters are handled during and after migration operations.

The remaining files in the provided information don't contain functions or classes directly relevant to this specific issue.

The core of the issue appears to be in how post-migration operations (particularly around Permissions) handle database routing, with the interaction between the migration command, connection router, and post-migrate signal handlers being the key areas to investigate.
