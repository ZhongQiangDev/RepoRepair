Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The current implementation of AutocompleteJsonView doesn't provide a clean way to add extra fields/attributes to autocomplete response items. Users need to completely override the get() method to add custom attributes, which creates maintenance overhead as the base get() method evolves.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method directly constructs the result dictionary inside the method without providing any extension points. The result formatting is hardcoded to only include 'id' and 'text' fields, making it impossible to add custom fields without overriding the entire method.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/contrib/admin/options.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/options.py
class: ModelAdmin
```
This class is relevant as it handles the admin configuration and URL routing for autocomplete views.

django/contrib/admin/widgets.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/widgets.py
class: AutocompleteMixin
class: AutocompleteSelect
class: AutocompleteSelectMultiple
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the frontend widget implementation that consumes the autocomplete JSON response.

django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py
class: AutocompleteJsonView
```
This is the main class that needs modification as it handles the generation of autocomplete JSON responses.

The remaining files do not contain directly relevant functions/classes for this issue:

django/contrib/admin/widgets.py - The other classes in this file are not directly related to the autocomplete functionality.

django/contrib/admin/options.py - The other classes in this file are not directly involved in the autocomplete response generation.

The core of the problem lies in AutocompleteJsonView, where the response formatting needs to be made more flexible through a new extension point method.
