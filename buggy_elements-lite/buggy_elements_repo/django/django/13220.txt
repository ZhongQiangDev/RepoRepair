Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Identify the wrong behavior:
The issue is that ValidationErrors with identical messages don't equal each other when compared. This means that even if two ValidationError instances are created with the same messages, using == operator returns False.

2. Analyze the cause:
The cause appears to be that the ValidationError class doesn't implement the __eq__ method to properly compare two ValidationError instances. Without this method, Python falls back to comparing object identities rather than their content.

3. Examining relevant files:

django/core/exceptions.py:
```
django/core/exceptions.py
class: ValidationError
```
This is the primary class that needs modification. It contains the validation error implementation but lacks proper equality comparison.

django/core/checks/messages.py:
```
django/core/checks/messages.py
class: CheckMessage
```
This class is relevant as a reference because it already implements __eq__ method for comparing messages, which could serve as a model for implementing ValidationError comparison.

django/forms/utils.py:
```
django/forms/utils.py
class: ErrorDict
class: ErrorList
```
These classes are relevant as they handle collections of ValidationErrors and would be affected by ValidationError equality behavior.

django/template/exceptions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/exceptions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The main focus should be on the ValidationError class in django/core/exceptions.py, as it's the root of the issue. The CheckMessage class provides a good example of implementing message comparison, while ErrorDict and ErrorList would benefit from proper ValidationError equality comparison.
