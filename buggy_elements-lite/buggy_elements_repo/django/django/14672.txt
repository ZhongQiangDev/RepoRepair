Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails with a TypeError: "unhashable type: 'list'" when trying to hash a ManyToManyRel object. This occurs specifically when checking proxy models and the through_fields parameter is provided as a list.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the identity property in ForeignObjectRel being used for hashing, but when through_fields is a list in ManyToManyRel, it's not converted to a hashable type (like tuple) before being included in the identity tuple. While limit_choices_to is made hashable, through_fields is missing this conversion.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
class: ManyToManyField
class: ForeignObject
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the relationship field setup and configuration that leads to the creation of ManyToManyRel instances.

django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py:
```
django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py
class: ForeignObjectRel
class: ManyToManyRel
```
These are the most directly relevant classes since ManyToManyRel inherits from ForeignObjectRel and contains the through_fields attribute that needs to be made hashable. The identity property that's causing the hash error is defined in ForeignObjectRel.

The other files and classes shown in the relevant files don't contain code that's directly related to the hashing behavior or the through_fields handling that's causing the issue. While they're part of the broader relationship system in Django, they're not involved in this specific bug.

The fix would need to be implemented in ManyToManyRel to ensure through_fields is converted to a hashable type (likely using make_hashable) before it's included in the identity tuple used for hashing.
