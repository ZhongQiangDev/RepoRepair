Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs in `TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` where objects are not being properly restored during test database rollback. Specifically, when `serialized_rollback = True`, the deserialization process fails due to foreign key constraints, as objects containing foreign keys might be saved before the objects they reference.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that `serialize_db_to_string` orders models using `serializers.sort_dependencies`, which only handles natural keys but doesn't consider foreign key dependencies. When `deserialize_db_from_string` tries to restore the data, it processes objects in the same order without wrapping them in a transaction. This can lead to integrity errors if an object with a foreign key is saved before its referenced object exists.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes by File:

```
django/core/serializers/base.py
class: Serializer
class: Deserializer
class: DeserializedObject
```

```
django/db/backends/base/creation.py
class: BaseDatabaseCreation
```

```
django/db/transaction.py
class: Atomic
function: atomic
```

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The key components involved are:
- The serialization/deserialization process (Serializer, Deserializer, DeserializedObject)
- The database creation class that handles test database operations (BaseDatabaseCreation)
- The transaction management functionality (Atomic, atomic) that's missing in the current implementation but needed for the fix

These components work together in the test database rollback process, and the fix involves wrapping the deserialization in a transaction to ensure all objects can be restored without violating foreign key constraints.
