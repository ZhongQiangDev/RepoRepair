Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When entering "14:00" into a DurationField, it's interpreted as "00:14:00" (14 minutes)
- The error message incorrectly states the format should be "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]"
- The actual expected format should be "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]" because:
  - Seconds are mandatory
  - Minutes are optional
  - Hours are optional if minutes are provided

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue lies in the error message documentation and validation logic in DurationField
- The format string in the error message doesn't match the actual parsing behavior
- There's also a suggestion to add default help_text to make the format more clear to users

3. Examining Files:

django/forms/fields.py:
```
django/forms/fields.py
class DurationField
```
This class is directly responsible for handling duration input validation and error messages.

django/utils/duration.py:
```
django/utils/duration.py
function: duration_string
function: duration_iso_string
```
These functions handle duration string formatting and could be involved in how durations are displayed or validated.

The remaining files and classes in the provided information are not directly relevant to the duration format validation or error message handling issue.

The core of the problem appears to be in the DurationField class where the error message format string needs to be corrected to accurately reflect the actual parsing behavior of duration inputs.
