Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The FilePathField's path parameter is being resolved during migration creation (makemigrations) based on the local machine's file system path, rather than maintaining the dynamic path construction logic (os.path.join) in the migration file. This causes issues when running migrations on different machines where file paths differ.

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue is that Django's serialization system for migrations is converting the dynamic path construction (os.path.join call) into a static string during migration creation, instead of preserving the callable/function call. This means the path is being evaluated too early, during migration creation, rather than when the migration is actually executed.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

django/core/files/storage.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/files/uploadedfile.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/serializer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
class: BaseSerializer
class: DeconstructableSerializer
class: FunctionTypeSerializer
```

django/db/migrations/writer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/writer.py
class: MigrationWriter
class: OperationWriter
```

django/forms/models.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue primarily involves the migration serialization system. The `DeconstructableSerializer` and `FunctionTypeSerializer` are responsible for converting Python objects and function calls into their string representations for migrations. The `MigrationWriter` and `OperationWriter` use these serializers to generate the final migration file content. The current implementation doesn't properly handle the case where a FilePathField's path should remain as a callable function rather than being evaluated during serialization.
