Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When renaming a primary key field in a model (ModelA.field_wrong to ModelA.field_fixed), the ForeignKey in another model (ModelB) that references this primary key still points to the old field name (field_wrong) instead of updating to the new field name (field_fixed).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the migration system's handling of field renames when the renamed field is a primary key and is referenced by foreign keys in other models. The migration system is not properly updating the `to_field` parameter in related ForeignKey fields when the referenced primary key field is renamed.

3. File Analysis:

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for detecting changes between model states and generating appropriate migration operations. It should detect field renames and update related foreign key references.

django/db/migrations/executor.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/migration.py:
```
django/db/migrations/migration.py
class: Migration
```
This class is relevant as it handles the execution of migration operations and maintains the state of model changes.

django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
class: RenameField
class: AlterField
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle field renaming operations and field alterations, which should include updating foreign key references.

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue likely stems from either the MigrationAutodetector not properly detecting the need to update foreign key references when a primary key is renamed, or the RenameField operation not properly handling the cascading updates to related fields' to_field parameters.
