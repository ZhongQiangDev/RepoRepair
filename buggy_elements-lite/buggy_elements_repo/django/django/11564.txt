Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The {% static '...' %} tag and related static file handling functions don't properly handle SCRIPT_NAME when generating URLs for static files. When running a Django application in a sub-path configuration using WSGI's SCRIPT_NAME parameter, the generated static URLs are incorrect because they don't include the SCRIPT_NAME prefix.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that Django's static file handling system doesn't take into account the SCRIPT_NAME WSGI parameter when constructing URLs. While Django's WSGI handler correctly processes SCRIPT_NAME for regular URLs, this information isn't propagated to the static file handling system. The static URL generation process simply concatenates STATIC_URL with the file path without considering the SCRIPT_NAME prefix.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py
class: StaticFilesStorage
class: ManifestStaticFilesStorage
```
These storage classes are responsible for handling static file URLs and need to be modified to consider SCRIPT_NAME.

```
django/templatetags/static.py
class: StaticNode
function: do_static
```
These handle the {% static %} template tag and need to be updated to incorporate SCRIPT_NAME in URL generation.

```
django/core/handlers/wsgi.py
function: get_script_name
class: WSGIHandler
```
These are relevant as they handle SCRIPT_NAME processing in the WSGI layer and could be used to access the SCRIPT_NAME value.

```
django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py
class: StaticFilesHandler
```
This handler serves static files and needs to consider SCRIPT_NAME when constructing URLs.

For the remaining files:
```
django/contrib/staticfiles/views.py
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The solution would likely involve modifying the static file handling system to access and incorporate the SCRIPT_NAME value from the WSGI environment when generating static URLs.
