Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to use ASGIStaticFilesHandler, resulting in a TypeError indicating that a 'NoneType' object is not callable. This happens during the async request handling process.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error trace shows that when calling `get_response_async` through the inheritance chain, it hits a None value instead of a callable function. This suggests that while the synchronous `get_response` method exists in StaticFilesHandler, its async counterpart `get_response_async` is missing, which is necessary for ASGI operation.

3. File Analysis:

django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py:
```
django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py
class: StaticFilesHandler
```
This class needs to implement get_response_async for ASGI support.

django/core/handlers/asgi.py:
```
django/core/handlers/asgi.py
class: ASGIHandler
```
This file contains the ASGI handler that's trying to call get_response_async.

django/core/handlers/base.py:
```
django/core/handlers/base.py
class: BaseHandler
```
This contains the base implementation of request handling including get_response_async that's being called in the error stack.

The issue stems from the StaticFilesHandler not properly implementing the async interface required for ASGI operation. While it implements the synchronous methods, it's missing the asynchronous counterpart, causing the error when used in an ASGI context. The fix would involve adding get_response_async to StaticFilesHandler to properly handle async static file serving.
