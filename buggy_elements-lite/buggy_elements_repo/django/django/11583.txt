Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The StatReloader is throwing "ValueError: embedded null byte" errors intermittently during auto-reloading. This occurs when trying to resolve paths using pathlib, specifically when calling os.readlink() on certain paths.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the path resolution process when:
- The StatReloader is watching files for changes
- It attempts to resolve symbolic links using pathlib.Path.resolve()
- A null byte is encountered in a path, specifically around the /Users directory
- This likely happens due to an issue with mounted network drives or filesystem inconsistencies that introduce null bytes into path strings

3. Relevant Functions/Classes in Each File:

```
django/core/handlers/wsgi.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/core/management/base.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/core/management/commands/runserver.py
class: Command
```

```
django/core/servers/basehttp.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/utils/autoreload.py
class: StatReloader
class: BaseReloader
function: iter_modules_and_files
function: iter_all_python_module_files
```

The key issue stems from the StatReloader class in autoreload.py, which is responsible for watching files and handling reloading. The error occurs in its file watching mechanism when it tries to resolve paths. The iter_modules_and_files and iter_all_python_module_files functions are also relevant as they're involved in gathering the paths that need to be watched.

The Command class from runserver.py is relevant because it initiates the auto-reloading process, though it's not directly responsible for the error.

The BaseReloader class is relevant as it provides the base functionality that StatReloader extends, including some of the file watching mechanisms.
