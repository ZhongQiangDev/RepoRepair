Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that Django forms do not validate whether a field's max_length is sufficient to accommodate the longest value in the field's choices. This can lead to database errors when trying to save a record with a choice value that exceeds the field's max_length.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that there's no validation check in Django's form field validation logic to compare the length of each choice value against the field's max_length constraint. This validation should happen when the field is initialized or during the validation process.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/contrib/admin/checks.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/validators.py:
```
django/core/validators.py
class: MaxLengthValidator
```

django/forms/fields.py:
```
django/forms/fields.py
class: CharField
class: ChoiceField
```

django/forms/models.py:
```
django/forms/models.py
class: ModelChoiceField
class: ModelFormMetaclass
```

The issue primarily relates to form field validation and choice handling. The CharField class handles max_length validation, while ChoiceField manages choices. ModelChoiceField extends this for model-based choices. The MaxLengthValidator performs the actual length validation, but currently doesn't check choice values. The ModelFormMetaclass is involved as it handles the creation of form fields from model fields.

These components would need to be modified to implement validation that ensures max_length is sufficient for all choice values.
