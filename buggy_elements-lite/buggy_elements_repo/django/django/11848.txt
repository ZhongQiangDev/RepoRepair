Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The current implementation incorrectly handles two-digit years in HTTP date parsing by using a hard-coded rule where:
- Years 00-69 are interpreted as 2000-2069
- Years 70-99 are interpreted as 1970-1999

According to RFC 7231, two-digit years should be interpreted relative to the current year, where any year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as being in the past.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue lies in the logic for converting two-digit years to four-digit years in HTTP date parsing. Instead of using a fixed cutoff at year 70, the code should:
- Calculate a cutoff based on the current year
- Compare the two-digit year against this dynamic cutoff
- Interpret years that would be more than 50 years in the future as being in the past

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

django/utils/dateformat.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/utils/dateparse.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/utils/formats.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/utils/http.py:
```
django/utils/http.py
function: parse_http_date
```

django/utils/timezone.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue is specifically related to HTTP date parsing in RFC 850 format, which is handled in the parse_http_date function in django/utils/http.py. This function would need to be modified to implement the correct logic for handling two-digit years according to RFC 7231.
