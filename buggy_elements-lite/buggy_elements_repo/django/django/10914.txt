Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that uploaded files are being created with inconsistent permissions (0o600) when using TemporaryUploadedFile, while the expected behavior would be to have consistent file permissions (0o644) regardless of which upload handler is used.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that when using TemporaryUploadedFile, the file is first created using Python's tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile which sets permissions to 0o600 for security. When this file is later moved to its final location, these restrictive permissions are preserved instead of using Django's default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting.

3. File-by-file Analysis:

django/core/files/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/files/storage.py:
```
django/core/files/storage.py
class: FileSystemStorage
```
This class is relevant because it handles the final storage of uploaded files and applies file permissions.

django/core/files/temp.py:
```
django/core/files/temp.py
class: TemporaryFile
```
This class is relevant as it's used in the temporary file creation process and could affect the initial file permissions.

django/core/files/uploadedfile.py:
```
django/core/files/uploadedfile.py
class: TemporaryUploadedFile
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for managing temporary uploaded files and is directly involved in the permission issue.

django/core/files/uploadhandler.py:
```
django/core/files/uploadhandler.py
class: TemporaryFileUploadHandler
```
This class is relevant as it's the handler that uses TemporaryUploadedFile and is part of the upload process where the permission issue occurs.

The issue primarily involves the interaction between TemporaryUploadedFile, FileSystemStorage, and the underlying temporary file creation process. The fix would likely need to modify how permissions are handled when moving files from temporary storage to their final location.
