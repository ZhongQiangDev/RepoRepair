Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `sqlmigrate` command is incorrectly wrapping SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements for databases that don't support transactional DDL. This means it's adding transaction blocks even when the database engine doesn't support rolling back DDL operations.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the `sqlmigrate` command only checking `migration.atomic` to determine whether to wrap the output in transactions, without considering the database's capability to rollback DDL operations (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`).

3. File Analysis:

django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py:
```
django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py
class: Command
```
This is relevant because it contains the core logic for the sqlmigrate command and specifically handles the output_transaction flag that determines whether to wrap SQL in transactions.

django/db/transaction.py:
```
django/db/transaction.py
class: Atomic
```
This is relevant as it's the underlying class that handles transaction management and would be involved in how transactions are processed.

django/db/migrations/executor.py:
```
django/db/migrations/executor.py
class: MigrationExecutor
```
This is relevant because it's responsible for executing migrations and interacts with the database connection features that determine DDL rollback capability.

The issue specifically needs to be fixed in the Command class of sqlmigrate.py, where the output_transaction attribute should consider both migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl before deciding to wrap the output in transaction statements.
