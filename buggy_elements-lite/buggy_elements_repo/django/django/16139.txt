Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When accessing the UserAdmin through another model's Admin that uses a to_field parameter (like uuid), the link to the password reset form becomes broken (404). The problem occurs because the URL path is incorrectly constructed as "../password/" instead of considering the actual path needed when accessing through a UUID.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the UserChangeForm's __init__ method where it hardcodes the password form URL as "../password/". When accessing the UserAdmin via UUID, the URL structure changes but the hardcoded path doesn't account for this change. The correct path should be "../../{user.pk}/password/" to properly navigate back to the user's ID-based URL structure.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

django/contrib/admin/options.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/options.py
class: ModelAdmin
```
This class is relevant as it handles the base admin functionality and URL routing.

django/contrib/auth/admin.py:
```
django/contrib/auth/admin.py
class: UserAdmin
```
This class is relevant as it's the specific admin implementation where the password change functionality is accessed.

django/contrib/auth/forms.py:
```
django/contrib/auth/forms.py
class: UserChangeForm
class: ReadOnlyPasswordHashField
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle the password field display and URL generation that's causing the issue.

django/contrib/admin/options.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/options.py
class: BaseModelAdmin
```
This class is relevant as it provides the base functionality for model admin operations and URL handling.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue lies in the UserChangeForm's password field help text formatting, which needs to be updated to handle different URL patterns when accessed through to_field parameters.
