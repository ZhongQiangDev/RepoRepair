Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that when an empty string is provided for the If-Modified-Since header, it now raises an exception. Previously, empty strings were ignored for this header.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to header parsing in conditional GET requests. When an empty string is provided for If-Modified-Since, the code is not properly handling this edge case and throwing an exception instead of ignoring it as it did before commit d6aff369ad3.

3. File Analysis:

django/middleware/http.py:
```
django/middleware/http.py
class: ConditionalGetMiddleware
```
This class is relevant as it handles conditional GET requests and processes If-Modified-Since headers.

django/utils/cache.py:
```
django/utils/cache.py
function: get_conditional_response
function: _if_modified_since_passes
```
These functions are relevant as they handle the If-Modified-Since header processing and conditional response generation.

django/utils/http.py:
```
django/utils/http.py
function: parse_http_date
function: parse_http_date_safe
```
These functions are relevant as they handle the parsing of HTTP date headers, including If-Modified-Since.

django/views/static.py:
```
django/views/static.py
function: was_modified_since
```
This function is relevant as it specifically handles If-Modified-Since header validation.

django/views/decorators/http.py:
```
django/views/decorators/http.py
function: condition
```
This function is relevant as it's a decorator that handles conditional requests including If-Modified-Since headers.
