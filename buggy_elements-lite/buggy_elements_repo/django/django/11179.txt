Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when calling delete() on model instances that have no dependencies (no related objects), the primary key (PK) value is not being set to None after deletion. This means the deleted instance still retains its PK value when it should be cleared.

2. Cause Analysis:
The cause appears to be in the deletion process where after successfully deleting an instance from the database, the code is not updating the instance's PK value to None. This should happen in the model's delete() method after the actual database deletion occurs.

3. Examining Files:

django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/management/commands/flush.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/base.py:
```
django/db/models/base.py
class: Model
```
This is highly relevant as it contains the core delete() method that needs to clear the PK.

django/db/models/deletion.py:
```
django/db/models/deletion.py
class: Collector
```
This class handles the deletion process and might need to be modified to ensure PKs are cleared.

django/db/models/manager.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue primarily lies in the Model class's delete() method and potentially the Collector class that handles deletions. The Model class is where the PK should be cleared after successful deletion, particularly for instances with no dependencies. The Collector class might also need to be involved if it's responsible for post-deletion cleanup.
