Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when squashing migrations that contain Meta.index_together configurations, the deprecation warnings for index_together are not being removed, even though index_together should be transitioned to Meta.indexes in Django 4.2.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that during migration squashing, the system is not properly converting the old index_together style to the new indexes style. When migrations are squashed, the AlterIndexTogether operations should be transformed into equivalent AddIndex operations to align with Django 4.2's preferred approach.

3. File Analysis:

django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py:
```
django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py
class: Command
```
This class is relevant as it handles the squashing process and should be involved in transforming operations during squashing.

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for detecting changes and generating migration operations, including handling index-related changes.

django/db/migrations/migration.py:
```
django/db/migrations/migration.py
class: Migration
```
This class is relevant as it represents migrations and their operations, which need to be properly transformed during squashing.

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
class: MigrationOptimizer
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for optimizing and potentially transforming operations during the squashing process.

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: AlterIndexTogether
class: AddIndex
```
These classes are directly relevant as they represent the old and new ways of handling indexes, and the transformation should occur between these two operation types.

The issue likely requires modifications to handle the transformation from AlterIndexTogether operations to AddIndex operations during the squashing process, particularly in the MigrationOptimizer class where operations can be combined or transformed.
