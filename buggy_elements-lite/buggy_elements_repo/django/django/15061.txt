Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The MultiWidget class is generating an id_for_label that includes an index (e.g., f'{id_}0') even when it's not needed or wanted. This behavior cannot be controlled by the developer.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the MultiWidget class's id_for_label method which always appends an index '0' to the ID. This is hardcoded behavior that doesn't allow flexibility for cases where developers want to control whether the index is added or not, similar to how ChoiceWidget has self.add_id_index to control this behavior.

3. Examining Files:

django/forms/boundfield.py:
```
django/forms/boundfield.py
class: BoundField
class: BoundWidget
```
These classes are relevant because they handle widget rendering and label generation, including the id_for_label functionality.

django/forms/fields.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/forms/widgets.py:
```
django/forms/widgets.py
class: MultiWidget
class: ChoiceWidget
```
These classes are directly relevant as MultiWidget contains the problematic id_for_label implementation, and ChoiceWidget provides the example of flexible index handling that should be emulated.

The issue primarily involves the MultiWidget class in widgets.py, which needs to be modified to provide more flexibility in ID generation, similar to how ChoiceWidget handles it. The BoundField and BoundWidget classes are also relevant as they are part of the rendering chain that uses these IDs for labels.
