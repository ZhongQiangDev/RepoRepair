Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The makemigrations command generates a migration file that references `models.Model` in the bases tuple without importing the required `models` module. This causes a NameError when the migration file is executed.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue occurs in the serialization process when handling model inheritance. The migration writer fails to add the necessary import statement for `models` when serializing the base classes of `MyModel`. While it correctly imports `app.models` for `MyMixin`, it misses importing `django.db.models` for `models.Model`.

3. Examining Files:

django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/loader.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/serializer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
class: DeconstructableSerializer
class: TypeSerializer
```

django/db/migrations/writer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/writer.py
class: MigrationWriter
class: OperationWriter
```

The issue appears to be primarily in the serialization process, specifically in how model bases are handled. The `DeconstructableSerializer` and `TypeSerializer` in serializer.py are responsible for serializing model fields and types, while `MigrationWriter` and `OperationWriter` in writer.py handle the overall migration file generation. The bug likely stems from the interaction between these components when handling model inheritance and import statements.

The serialization process should ensure that when `models.Model` is used as a base class, the corresponding import statement `from django.db import models` is included in the generated migration file.
