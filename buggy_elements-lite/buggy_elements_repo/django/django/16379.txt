Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The FileBasedCache's has_key method is throwing a FileNotFoundError when trying to open a cache file that was detected to exist but was deleted before it could be opened. This creates an unexpected exception instead of gracefully handling the case.

2. Cause Analysis:
There's a race condition in the has_key method where:
- First, it checks if the file exists using os.path.exists(fname)
- Then, it tries to open the file with open(fname, "rb")
- Between these two operations, another thread could delete the file (especially if the file is expired and _is_expired() deletes it)
This creates a time window where the file existence check passes but the file is gone when trying to open it.

3. File Analysis:

django/core/cache/backends/base.py:
```
django/core/cache/backends/base.py
class: BaseCache
```
This is relevant as it's the parent class defining the basic cache interface that FileBasedCache implements.

django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py:
```
django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py
class: FileBasedCache
```
This contains the actual problematic code in its has_key method and related file operations.

django/core/cache/backends/locmem.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
While this file shows another cache implementation, it's not directly relevant to the file-based cache race condition issue.

The main focus should be on FileBasedCache class, as it contains both the problematic has_key method and the _is_expired method that can cause the race condition. The BaseCache class is also relevant as it defines the interface that FileBasedCache must implement, though it's not directly involved in the bug.
