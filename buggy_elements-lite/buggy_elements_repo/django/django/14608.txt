Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that FormSets do not add a 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors, unlike Forms which add a 'nonfield' CSS class for non-field errors. This inconsistency makes it difficult for developers to style non-form errors differently from other types of errors in FormSets.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that while Django's Forms implementation includes logic to add the 'nonfield' CSS class to ErrorList instances for non-field errors, there is no equivalent implementation in FormSets to add a 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors. This is likely an oversight in the error handling and CSS class assignment logic for FormSets.

3. Examining Files:

django/core/exceptions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/forms/forms.py:
```
django/forms/forms.py
class: BaseForm
class: ErrorList
```

django/forms/formsets.py:
```
django/forms/formsets.py
class: BaseFormSet
```

django/forms/models.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/forms/utils.py:
```
django/forms/utils.py
class: ErrorDict
class: ErrorList
```

The most relevant components are BaseFormSet (which needs to be modified to add the nonform CSS class), and ErrorList (which handles the CSS classes for error displays). BaseForm is also relevant as it provides the reference implementation for how nonfield errors are handled, which should be mirrored for nonform errors in FormSets.
