Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When DEBUG is True and Http404 is raised in a path converter's to_python method, instead of showing a detailed technical 404 response with debugging information, it shows a generic server error message: "A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator."

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how Django handles Http404 exceptions raised during URL path conversion. When Http404 is raised in a path converter's to_python method, it's not being properly caught and converted to a technical 404 response when DEBUG=True. Instead, it's being treated as a general server error.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes in Each File:

django/core/exceptions.py:
```
django/core/exceptions.py
class: Http404
```

django/core/handlers/exception.py:
```
django/core/handlers/exception.py
function: convert_exception_to_response
function: response_for_exception
```

django/http/response.py:
```
django/http/response.py
class: Http404
```

django/urls/resolvers.py:
```
django/urls/resolvers.py
class URLPattern
class URLResolver
```

django/views/debug.py:
```
django/views/debug.py
function: technical_404_response
```

The issue likely involves the interaction between these components:
- The Http404 exception class that's being raised
- The URL resolver classes that handle path conversion
- The exception handling functions that should convert Http404 to appropriate responses
- The technical_404_response function that should generate detailed debug information

The fix would likely need to modify how Http404 exceptions from path converters are handled in the exception handling chain, ensuring they're properly caught and directed to technical_404_response when DEBUG=True.
