Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs in Django 3.0.4 where a GROUP BY clause in a SQL query is causing an ambiguous column reference error. The query involves a subquery with a status field, and when trying to group by this status, PostgreSQL complains that the "status" column reference is ambiguous.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how Django 3.0.4 generates the GROUP BY clause for queries involving subqueries and annotations. In Django 2.2.11, the GROUP BY clause correctly includes the full subquery expression, but in 3.0.4, it only includes the column name "status" without properly qualifying it, leading to ambiguity since there could be multiple "status" columns from different tables or subqueries.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/models/expressions.py:
```
django/db/models/expressions.py
class: Subquery
class: Col
class: BaseExpression
```

django/db/models/lookups.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
class: SQLCompiler
class: SQLAggregateCompiler
```

django/db/models/sql/query.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
class: Query
```

The issue likely stems from the interaction between SQLCompiler's GROUP BY clause generation and how Subquery expressions are handled in the query compilation process. The change in behavior between Django versions suggests a modification in how these components work together to generate the final SQL query.
