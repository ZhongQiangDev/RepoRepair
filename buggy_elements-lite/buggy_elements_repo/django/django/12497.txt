Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Identifying the wrong behavior:
The issue is that when there are more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a many-to-many field and no through_fields have been set, Django shows an error with incorrect hint text. The hint suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical=False` and `through` parameters, but these are actually parameters for `ManyToManyField`, not `ForeignKey`.

2. Analyzing the cause:
The cause appears to be a mistake in the error hint text where the developer wrote the hint assuming `ManyToManyField` parameters but referenced `ForeignKey` instead. Additionally, the hint mentions `symmetrical=False` which is no longer required since Django 3.0 for recursive relationships with intermediary models.

3. Examining relevant files:

django/core/serializers/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/manager.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/query.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
class: ForeignKey
class: ManyToManyField
function: create_many_to_many_intermediary_model
```

django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The most relevant components are in the related.py file since this issue involves the relationship between ForeignKey and ManyToManyField classes, particularly in how they handle recursive relationships and their parameters. The create_many_to_many_intermediary_model function is also relevant as it's involved in creating the intermediary model where multiple ForeignKeys can exist.
