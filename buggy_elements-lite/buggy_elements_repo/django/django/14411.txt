Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget's label element has a 'for' attribute that points to a non-labelable element. Since this widget only renders text and not an actual input element, there shouldn't be a 'for' attribute in its label.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the widget's implementation where it's rendering a read-only text display rather than an actual input field, but the label is still being generated with a 'for' attribute as if it were pointing to an input element. This is incorrect because HTML label's 'for' attribute should only point to labelable elements (like inputs, textareas, etc.).

3. Examining Files:

django/contrib/admin/helpers.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
class: AdminField
class: AdminReadonlyField
```
These classes are relevant because they handle the rendering of admin form fields, including read-only fields.

django/contrib/admin/widgets.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/widgets.py
class: ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget
```
This is the main widget causing the issue, as it's the one rendering the password hash in read-only format.

django/contrib/auth/forms.py:
```
django/contrib/auth/forms.py
class: ReadOnlyPasswordHashField
```
This class is relevant as it's the field type that uses the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget.

django/forms/boundfield.py:
```
django/forms/boundfield.py
class: BoundField
```
This class is relevant because it handles the generation of field labels and their 'for' attributes.

django/forms/widgets.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely needs to be fixed in either the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget implementation or in how AdminReadonlyField/BoundField handles the label generation for read-only widgets.
