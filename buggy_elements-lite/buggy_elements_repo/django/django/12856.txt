Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When a model gains a UniqueConstraint, the makemigrations command doesn't validate whether the fields specified in the constraint actually exist in the model. This is inconsistent with the behavior of unique_together, which raises models.E012 when fields don't exist.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be a missing validation step in the handling of UniqueConstraint fields. While the unique_together validation is implemented, a similar check is not performed for UniqueConstraint fields during the migration process. This validation should occur during the model's system checks or migration preparation.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
class: Command
```
This class is relevant as it handles the makemigrations command and should trigger validation checks.

```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it detects model changes and should validate constraints during migration generation.

```
django/db/models/constraints.py
class: UniqueConstraint
class: BaseConstraint
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle the constraint definition and validation.

```
django/db/models/base.py
class: Model
```
This class is relevant as it's the metaclass for models and could be involved in field validation during model creation.

The remaining files in the provided information don't contain functions or classes directly relevant to the validation of constraint fields during migration generation.

The fix would likely involve adding field validation logic in either the UniqueConstraint class or the MigrationAutodetector class to ensure fields specified in the constraint exist in the model, similar to how unique_together validation works.
