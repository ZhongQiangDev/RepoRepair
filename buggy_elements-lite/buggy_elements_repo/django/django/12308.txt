Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- JSONField values are displayed as Python dict format instead of valid JSON format in the admin interface when they are readonly
- For example, {"foo": "bar"} is displayed as {'foo': 'bar'}, which uses single quotes instead of double quotes and is not valid JSON

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how readonly JSONFields are handled in the admin interface
- When a field is readonly, the admin interface uses display_for_field to format the value
- The current implementation likely directly converts the Python dict to string without proper JSON formatting
- It should use the JSONField's prepare_value method which would properly format the value as JSON

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

django/contrib/admin/helpers.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
class: AdminReadonlyField
```
This class handles how readonly fields are displayed in the admin interface.

django/contrib/admin/options.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/contrib/admin/utils.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/utils.py
function: display_for_field
```
This function is responsible for formatting field values for display in the admin interface.

django/contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py:
```
django/contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py
class: JSONField
```
This class defines the behavior of JSON fields including how they should be formatted.

django/contrib/postgres/forms/jsonb.py:
```
django/contrib/postgres/forms/jsonb.py
class: JSONField
function: prepare_value
```
This class and function handle JSON field form behavior including value preparation for display.

The issue likely needs to be fixed by modifying how display_for_field handles JSONField values, potentially by calling the field's prepare_value method instead of directly converting the value to string.
