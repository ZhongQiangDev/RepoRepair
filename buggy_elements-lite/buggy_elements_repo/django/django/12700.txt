Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that Django's `SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings()` is not properly cleansing sensitive values within nested iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) in settings. Only dictionary values are being cleansed, while sensitive data within lists or other iterables remains exposed.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is in the cleansing logic that only handles dictionary type values but doesn't recursively check other iterable types like lists or tuples. When encountering a non-dictionary iterable containing sensitive data, the cleansing function returns it as-is without inspecting its contents.

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

django/core/exceptions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/checks/security/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/utils/safestring.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/views/debug.py:
```
django/views/debug.py
function: cleanse_setting
function: get_safe_settings
class: SafeExceptionReporterFilter
```

The key functions/class involved are in django/views/debug.py:
- `cleanse_setting`: This is the core function that needs modification as it currently only handles dictionary types for cleansing sensitive data
- `get_safe_settings`: This function uses cleanse_setting to process all settings
- `SafeExceptionReporterFilter`: The class that provides the filtering functionality for sensitive data

These components need to be modified to handle recursive cleansing of sensitive data in all iterable types, not just dictionaries.
