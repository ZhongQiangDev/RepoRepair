Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The shell command crashes when executing Python code containing functions through the -c option. Specifically, when using `python -m django shell -c` to run code that defines and calls a function, it fails with a NameError indicating that 'django' is not defined, even though the import statement is present.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how the shell command executes code using the exec() function. When executing the code passed via -c, the exec() call doesn't provide a proper globals dictionary, causing the imported modules to not be accessible within the function's scope. This is evident from the error occurring specifically when trying to access 'django' inside the function f().

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/core/management/commands/shell.py
class: Command
```
This is the primary location of the issue, as it contains the shell command implementation that handles the -c option execution. The handle() method in this class uses exec() without providing proper globals context.

```
django/core/management/base.py
class: BaseCommand
```
This is relevant as the parent class for the shell Command, providing the base execution framework.

The other files in the provided information do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to this specific issue:

```
django/views/debug.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/core/management/__init__.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The fix would need to modify the Command class in shell.py to provide a proper globals dictionary when calling exec(), ensuring imported modules remain accessible within function scopes.
