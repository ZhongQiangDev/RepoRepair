Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using the | (OR) operator with Q objects that contain a dict_keys object. The operation fails with a "TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object" error, even though the Q object itself can be created successfully with dict_keys.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that when combining Q objects with the | operator, Django attempts to pickle (serialize) the Q objects. The dict_keys object (returned by dict.keys()) is not pickleable in Python, causing the serialization to fail. This likely happens because Django needs to serialize the Q objects for database query construction or caching purposes.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

```
django/core/serializers/base.py
class: SerializationError
class: DeserializationError
```
These classes are relevant as they handle serialization errors which is the core of the problem.

```
django/db/models/query.py
class: Query
```
The Query class is relevant as it handles query construction and combination operations, which would be involved when using the | operator with Q objects.

```
django/core/serializers/python.py
class: Serializer
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for Python object serialization, which is where the pickling error occurs.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes as they deal with related fields, database operations, and other aspects not directly involved with Q object serialization or combination operations.

The issue likely needs to be fixed in the Query class's handling of Q object combinations, ensuring that dict_keys objects are converted to lists or other pickleable types before serialization attempts.
