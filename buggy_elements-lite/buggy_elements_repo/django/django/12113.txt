Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to use persistent SQLite test databases with --keepdb flag. The test admin_views.test_multidb fails with a "database is locked" error. This happens specifically when using TEST["NAME"] with multiple databases (both 'default' and 'other' databases).

2. Cause Analysis:
The error "database is locked" in SQLite typically occurs when multiple connections try to access the same database file simultaneously. In this case, the test suite is trying to use two persistent SQLite databases ('test_default.sqlite3' and 'test_other.sqlite3') in parallel, but SQLite's file-based locking mechanism is preventing concurrent access, causing the lock error.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes by File:

```
django/db/transaction.py
class: Atomic
function: atomic
```
These are relevant because they handle transaction management which is critical for test database operations and could affect how database locks are handled.

```
django/db/backends/base/creation.py
class: BaseDatabaseCreation
```
This is relevant as it's the base class for database creation handling, including test database setup which is directly related to the issue.

```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py
class: DatabaseWrapper
class: SQLiteCursorWrapper
```
These are relevant as they handle SQLite-specific database connections and cursor operations, which are directly related to database locking issues.

```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py
class: DatabaseCreation
```
This is relevant as it handles SQLite-specific test database creation and management, which is directly involved in the reported issue.

The remaining files do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to the database locking issue:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
