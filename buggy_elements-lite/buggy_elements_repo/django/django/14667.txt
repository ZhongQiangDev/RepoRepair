Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when chaining .only() and .defer() methods in Django QuerySet. When using .only("name").defer("name"), it unexpectedly loads all fields instead of loading just the 'id' field. Similarly, .only("name").defer("name", "country") also loads all fields instead of just 'id'.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in how the deferred fields are handled when chaining .only() and .defer(). When .only() is called, it sets up a specific set of fields to load, but when .defer() is subsequently called, it's not properly clearing or updating the field selection. This suggests an issue in how the query's deferred fields are managed and how they interact with the field selection from .only().

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

django/db/models/base.py:
```
django/db/models/base.py
class: Deferred
class: Model
```
These classes are relevant as they handle deferred field loading and model instance creation.

django/db/models/sql/query.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
class: Query
```
This class is highly relevant as it handles the core query building including field selection and deferral.

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/db/models/manager.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely stems from how the Query class handles the combination of .only() and .defer() operations, with the Model and Deferred classes being involved in the field loading process. The Query class would be responsible for maintaining the list of fields to select and defer, while the Model class would use this information when creating instances, and the Deferred class would mark fields that should be loaded lazily.
