Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when a functools.partial() function is used as a view in Django's URL routing system, the ResolverMatch.__repr__() method doesn't display useful information. Instead of showing the underlying function and its arguments, it just shows "functools.partial" which makes debugging and understanding the URL resolution more difficult.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how ResolverMatch handles partial functions in its __repr__() method. When a partial function is passed as the view, the class needs to unwrap the partial to access both the original function and any pre-bound arguments, but currently it's not doing this properly.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/urls/resolvers.py
class: ResolverMatch
class: URLPattern
```
These are relevant because:
- ResolverMatch is the main class where the __repr__() issue occurs
- URLPattern is relevant because it creates the ResolverMatch instances and handles the view callbacks, including partial functions

```
django/urls/base.py
function: resolve
```
This is relevant because it's the entry point for URL resolution and creates ResolverMatch instances.

The other files don't contain directly relevant functions/classes for this specific issue:

django/urls/conf.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/urls/exceptions.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/urls/utils.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The fix would likely need to be implemented in ResolverMatch class to properly handle partial functions in its __repr__() method, possibly by unwrapping the partial function to access both the original function and its pre-bound arguments.
