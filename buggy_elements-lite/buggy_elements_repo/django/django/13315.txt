Let me help you analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using limit_choices_to on a ForeignKey field with a Q object that involves a join. This results in duplicate options appearing in the form field's choices.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem likely stems from how the queryset is handled when applying limit_choices_to constraints to form fields. When a Q object with a join is used, the resulting queryset may not properly deduplicate the results, causing duplicate entries to appear in the form field's choices.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

django/db/models/query.py:
```
django/db/models/query.py
class: BaseIterable
class: ModelIterable
```
These classes handle how querysets are iterated and could be involved in how joined results are processed.

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
class: ForeignKey
```
This class is directly related to the issue as it handles the limit_choices_to functionality for foreign key relationships.

django/forms/models.py:
```
django/forms/models.py
class: ModelChoiceField
function: apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield
```
These are relevant because they handle how choices are generated for form fields based on model relationships and apply the limit_choices_to constraints.

django/forms/widgets.py:
```
django/forms/widgets.py
class: Select
class: ChoiceWidget
```
These classes are responsible for rendering the choices in the form field and could be involved in how duplicate options are displayed.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely involves the interaction between ForeignKey's limit_choices_to, how ModelChoiceField processes these constraints, and how the resulting queryset is rendered through the Select widget. The duplicate options probably emerge from how the queryset is evaluated when the limit_choices_to Q object includes a join.
