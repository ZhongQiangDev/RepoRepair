Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using optional URL parameters in Django 3.0. Specifically, when using a URL pattern with an optional parameter like `(?P<format>(html|json|xml))?`, the view function receives incorrect number of arguments, leading to a TypeError.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error message indicates that the view function `modules()` is being called with 3 positional arguments when it only accepts 1-2 arguments. This suggests that Django 3.0's URL resolver is handling optional parameters differently than in Django 2.2, possibly passing None or additional arguments when the optional parameter is not provided in the URL.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

django/core/checks/urls.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/handlers/base.py:
```
django/core/handlers/base.py
class: BaseHandler
```
This class is relevant as it handles the actual calling of view functions with resolved arguments.

django/urls/base.py:
```
django/urls/base.py
function: resolve
```
This function is relevant as it's responsible for resolving URLs to their corresponding view functions and arguments.

django/urls/conf.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/urls/resolvers.py:
```
django/urls/resolvers.py
class: URLPattern
class: URLResolver
class: ResolverMatch
```
These classes are highly relevant as they handle the URL pattern matching, argument extraction, and view function resolution. The issue likely stems from how these classes process optional parameters and prepare arguments for view functions.

The core issue appears to be in how URLResolver and URLPattern handle optional regex parameters and how they package those arguments before BaseHandler calls the view function. The change in behavior between Django 2.2 and 3.0 likely involves changes in how these components process optional URL parameters.
