Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when RenameIndex() operation is used to rename an unnamed index for unique_together. When moving the index backward and then forward again, it crashes with a "relation already exists" error on PostgreSQL.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that when handling unnamed indexes for unique_together constraints, the RenameIndex operation is not properly tracking or restoring the auto-generated name when moving backward and forward. This leads to a naming conflict when trying to recreate the index with a name that already exists in the database.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py:
```
django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py
class: DatabaseSchemaEditor
```
This class is relevant as it handles the actual SQL operations for creating and renaming indexes in PostgreSQL.

django/db/migrations/executor.py:
```
django/db/migrations/executor.py
class: MigrationExecutor
```
This class is relevant as it manages the execution of migrations including index operations.

django/db/migrations/migration.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: RenameIndex
class: IndexOperation
```
These classes are relevant as they handle unique_together constraints and index operations respectively.

django/db/models/indexes.py:
```
django/db/models/indexes.py
class: Index
```
This class is relevant as it handles index creation and naming logic.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between DatabaseSchemaEditor's index handling and the AlterUniqueTogether/IndexOperation classes when dealing with unnamed indexes. The Index class's name generation and validation would also play a role in this behavior.
