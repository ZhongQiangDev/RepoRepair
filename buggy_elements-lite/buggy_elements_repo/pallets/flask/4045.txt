Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that blueprint names containing dots are currently allowed, but this causes problems because dots are now significant for nested blueprints. This means blueprint names with dots could create ambiguity or conflicts in the blueprint hierarchy.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that there's no validation in the Blueprint class initialization to prevent dots in blueprint names, even though similar validation exists for endpoint names. Since dots are used to denote blueprint nesting hierarchy, allowing dots in individual blueprint names could lead to confusion and incorrect routing.

3. File Analysis:

src/flask/blueprints.py:
```
src/flask/blueprints.py
class: Blueprint
```
This is relevant because it's the main class responsible for blueprint creation and naming. The validation for blueprint names should be added in this class, likely in the __init__ method.

src/flask/scaffold.py:
```
src/flask/scaffold.py
function: _endpoint_from_view_func
```
This is relevant because it handles endpoint naming, which has similar naming restrictions. It could serve as a reference for implementing similar validation for blueprint names.

The other functions and classes in scaffold.py are not directly relevant to the blueprint naming issue as they deal with other aspects of Flask's functionality like package finding, setup methods, and loader operations.

The Blueprint class is the primary location where this fix needs to be implemented, as it's responsible for handling blueprint creation and naming. The _endpoint_from_view_func function is included because it provides a precedent for similar naming validation in Flask's codebase.
