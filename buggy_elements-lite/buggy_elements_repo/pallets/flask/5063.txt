Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Flask CLI's `flask routes` command does not display the subdomain information for routes, making it difficult to identify which routes belong to which subdomains.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the `routes_command` function in `cli.py` which is responsible for displaying route information. Currently, it only shows three columns: Endpoint, Methods, and Rule, but does not extract or display the subdomain information that is actually stored in the route rules.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

src/flask/cli.py:
```
src/flask/cli.py
function: routes_command
class: FlaskGroup
```
This file contains the core functionality for displaying routes. The `routes_command` function needs modification to include subdomain information, and `FlaskGroup` is the class that manages CLI commands.

src/flask/blueprints.py:
```
src/flask/blueprints.py
class: Blueprint
class: BlueprintSetupState
```
These classes are relevant because they handle the registration and setup of routes with subdomains. The Blueprint class stores subdomain information, and BlueprintSetupState processes it during registration.

src/flask/scaffold.py:
```
src/flask/scaffold.py
class: Scaffold
```
The Scaffold class is relevant as it's the base class containing core routing functionality that both Flask app and Blueprints inherit from.

The remaining files do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to the route display functionality or subdomain handling:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
