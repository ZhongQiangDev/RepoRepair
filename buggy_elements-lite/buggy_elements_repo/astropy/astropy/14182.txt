Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The RST writer does not support the `header_rows` parameter, which is supported by other writers like `ascii.fixed_width`. When attempting to use `header_rows` with the RST writer, it raises a TypeError indicating an unexpected keyword argument.

2. Cause Analysis:
The RST writer class (`RST`) inherits from `FixedWidth` but does not implement support for the `header_rows` parameter. This parameter would be useful for adding additional header information like units or other metadata in RST format tables. The error occurs because the RST class's `__init__` method doesn't accept this parameter, while other formats like `fixed_width` do.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
astropy/io/ascii/rst.py
class: RST
class: SimpleRSTData
```
These classes are directly responsible for RST table formatting and would need to be modified to support header rows.

```
astropy/io/ascii/core.py
class: BaseHeader
class: BaseReader
```
These base classes provide the fundamental table reading/writing functionality that would need to be extended to support header rows in RST format.

```
astropy/io/ascii/basic.py
class: FixedWidth
```
This is the parent class of RST and already has some functionality for handling fixed-width tables that could be leveraged for header rows support.

The remaining files in the provided information do not contain directly relevant functions or classes for this specific issue, as they deal with other aspects of the ASCII table handling system that aren't directly related to the RST writer's header row functionality.

The fix would likely involve modifying the RST class to accept and handle the header_rows parameter, similar to how the fixed_width writer implements it, while maintaining the RST-specific formatting requirements.
