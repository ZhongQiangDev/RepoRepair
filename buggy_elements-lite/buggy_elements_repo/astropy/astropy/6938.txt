Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code in fitsrec.py attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in floating point number formats using the replace() method on output_field, but the operation is not being applied effectively because replace() returns a new array instead of modifying the existing one.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that chararray.replace() is not an in-place operation - it returns a new array with the replacements made rather than modifying the original array. The current code doesn't capture this returned value, so the replacement is effectively lost. This is why commenting out the code doesn't cause test failures - the replacement operation wasn't actually doing anything.

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

astropy/io/fits/column.py:
```
astropy/io/fits/column.py
class: Column
class: _AsciiColumnFormat
```
These are relevant because they handle column formatting and ASCII data representation in FITS files, including the format specifications that would contain 'E' or 'D' exponent markers.

astropy/io/fits/file.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py:
```
astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py
class: FITS_rec
class: FITS_record
function: _ascii_encode
```
These are relevant because they handle the record array operations and ASCII encoding, which would be involved in the format conversion process between 'E' and 'D' formats.

The issue likely needs to be fixed by either:
1. Capturing the returned value from replace()
2. Using a different method that modifies the array in-place
3. Or implementing a new in-place replacement function specifically for this purpose
