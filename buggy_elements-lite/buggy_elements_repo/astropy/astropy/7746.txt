Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The WCS transformation fails when passing empty lists/arrays as input to wcs.wcs_pix2world(). Instead of returning empty lists/arrays, it raises an InconsistentAxisTypesError indicating that ncoord and/or nelem are inconsistent with the wcsprm.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the WCS coordinate transformation pipeline when handling empty arrays. The error message suggests that the underlying C implementation (wcslib) is not properly handling the case of zero-length inputs. This indicates that the Python wrapper around the C code needs to add special handling for empty arrays before passing them to the C functions.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

astropy/io/fits/util.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

astropy/wcs/utils.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

astropy/wcs/wcs.py:
```
astropy/wcs/wcs.py
class: WCS
```

The WCS class is relevant because:
1. It contains the wcs_pix2world method that's failing
2. It handles the coordinate transformations and interfaces with the underlying C library
3. It needs to be modified to handle empty array inputs before passing them to the C functions

The error occurs in the WCS class's coordinate transformation pipeline, specifically in the wcs_pix2world method. The fix would likely involve adding a check for empty arrays in this class, returning empty arrays immediately rather than attempting to process them through the C library.

The other files don't contain functions or classes directly related to the coordinate transformation process where the error occurs. The issue is specifically with how the WCS class handles empty arrays before passing them to the underlying C implementation.
