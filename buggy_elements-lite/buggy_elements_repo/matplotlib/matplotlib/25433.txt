Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using `clf` and `pyplot.draw` in a range slider's `on_changed` callback. After these operations, all widgets in the figure become unresponsive to input. However, the same operations work fine in a button's `on_clicked` callback.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to event handling and widget state management after clearing and redrawing the figure. When using `clf()`, it clears all the figure's contents including widgets. When redrawing with new widgets in the range slider callback, something is preventing proper event binding or widget state restoration, while this same operation works correctly in button callbacks.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
lib/matplotlib/widgets.py
class: RangeSlider
class: Button
class: Widget
class: AxesWidget
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle the widget creation, event binding, and interaction management. The base Widget and AxesWidget classes provide core functionality that might be affected by figure clearing and redrawing.

```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: clf
function: draw
```
These functions are directly involved in the issue as they're being called in the problematic code and affect the widget state.

```
lib/matplotlib/figure.py
class: FigureBase
```
The FigureBase class is relevant as it handles the clearing operation and manages the figure's state, which affects how widgets are preserved or recreated during redrawing.

The issue likely stems from how widget event bindings and state are handled when clearing and redrawing the figure. The RangeSlider's event handling might be more sensitive to figure clearing compared to Button's event handling, possibly due to differences in how they maintain their state or reconnect event handlers after figure operations.
