Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `set_visible(False)` function is not hiding the subplot when used with a 3D projection. In the example code, `ax1.set_visible(False)` should make the first subplot invisible, but it remains visible.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how visibility is handled specifically for 3D projections in matplotlib. The standard visibility setting mechanism may not be properly implemented or overridden for 3D axes, causing the visibility state to be ignored or not properly propagated to all components of the 3D subplot.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

lib/matplotlib/gridspec.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/gridspec.py
class: GridSpec
class: GridSpecBase
class: GridSpecFromSubplotSpec
class: SubplotSpec
```
These classes are relevant because they handle subplot creation and management, including properties like visibility. The issue might be related to how these classes handle property propagation to 3D subplots.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: subplot
function: figure
function: show
```
These functions are relevant because they are involved in creating and displaying the subplots, including 3D projections. The visibility issue might be related to how these functions handle subplot properties and their display.

The issue likely stems from either:
1. The visibility property not being properly propagated through the GridSpec system to 3D axes
2. The show/display logic in pyplot not properly respecting visibility settings for 3D projections
3. A potential disconnect between the standard visibility mechanism and the specialized 3D projection implementation

The other functions and classes in the provided files don't appear to be directly relevant to the visibility issue with 3D projections.
