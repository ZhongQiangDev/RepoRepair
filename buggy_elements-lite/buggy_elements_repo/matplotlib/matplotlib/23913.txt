Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that there is no keyword parameter to make a legend draggable at creation time. Users have to call a separate method after creating the legend to make it draggable.

2. Cause Analysis:
The cause appears to be that the Legend class's __init__ method doesn't have a parameter to enable draggability during initialization. Instead, users must create a DraggableLegend instance separately after creating the Legend.

3. Examining Files for Relevant Functions/Classes:

lib/matplotlib/legend.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/legend.py
class: Legend
class: DraggableLegend
```

lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py
class: DraggableBase
class: DraggableOffsetBox
```

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: legend
```

The issue could be resolved by:
1. Adding a 'draggable' parameter to Legend.__init__
2. Modifying the legend() function to pass this parameter through
3. Having Legend create a DraggableLegend instance internally when draggable=True

This would provide a more intuitive API while maintaining the existing functionality.
