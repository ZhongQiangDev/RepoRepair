Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to access the `_facecolors2d` attribute of a `Poly3DCollection` object returned by `plot_surface`. The code fails with an AttributeError indicating that this attribute doesn't exist.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that the `get_facecolors` method in `Poly3DCollection` is trying to access an attribute `_facecolors2d` that hasn't been properly initialized or set. This is likely a bug in the implementation where the 3D plotting functionality isn't properly handling the color mapping for the surface plot.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/cm.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
class: ScalarMappable
```
This class is relevant because it handles the conversion of scalar data into RGBA colors through normalization and colormapping, which is essential for surface plots.

lib/matplotlib/colors.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
class: Colormap
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for mapping scalar values to RGBA colors, which is part of the surface plotting process.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue appears to be related to how color mapping is handled in 3D plots, specifically with the `Poly3DCollection` class. The problem likely stems from an implementation issue where the 2D face colors aren't being properly initialized or maintained when creating 3D surface plots. The `ScalarMappable` and `Colormap` classes are involved in the color mapping process that leads to this error.

The fix would likely involve ensuring that the `_facecolors2d` attribute is properly initialized and maintained in the `Poly3DCollection` class when it's created during surface plotting.
