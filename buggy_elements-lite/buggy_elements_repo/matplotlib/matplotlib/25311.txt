Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that a figure with a draggable legend cannot be pickled (serialized). When attempting to pickle a figure that has a draggable legend, it raises a TypeError indicating that the 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object cannot be pickled.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because making a legend draggable adds a DraggableLegend instance to the legend object, which contains references to Qt-specific canvas objects that cannot be pickled. The Qt backend objects contain C++ objects and other non-serializable components. When leg.set_draggable(True) is called, it creates these non-picklable references.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/legend.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/legend.py
class: DraggableLegend
class: Legend
```
This file contains the core classes involved in the issue. DraggableLegend adds the draggable functionality that creates the non-picklable references, while Legend is the main class that gets modified when set_draggable is called.

lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py
class: DraggableBase
class: DraggableOffsetBox
```
These classes are relevant as they provide the base dragging functionality that DraggableLegend inherits from, and may contribute to the non-picklable state.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue stems from the implementation of draggable functionality in the legend and offsetbox classes, particularly how they interact with the backend-specific canvas objects. The core problem lies in the DraggableLegend class and its inheritance chain through DraggableOffsetBox and DraggableBase, which create references to non-picklable Qt objects.
