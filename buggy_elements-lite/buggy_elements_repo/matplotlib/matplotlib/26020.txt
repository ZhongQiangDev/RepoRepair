Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to create an AxisGrid using cartopy's GeoAxes as the axis_class. The code raises a TypeError indicating that a 'method' object is not subscriptable when trying to access axis["bottom"].

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from a difference in how the `axis` attribute behaves between matplotlib's standard Axes and GeoAxes. In standard Axes, `axis` returns a dictionary-like object that can be subscripted (e.g., axis["bottom"]), but in GeoAxes, `axis` is a method that cannot be subscripted. This causes the error in the `_tick_only` function when it tries to access `ax.axis["bottom"]`.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/artist.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

lib/matplotlib/axis.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/axis.py
class: Axis
class: XAxis
class: YAxis
```

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue is primarily related to axis handling and the incompatibility between standard matplotlib axes and GeoAxes from cartopy. The Axis, XAxis, and YAxis classes in matplotlib/axis.py are relevant because they define the standard axis behavior that GeoAxes is deviating from. The problem occurs because the code assumes all axis objects follow the standard matplotlib implementation where the axis attribute returns a dictionary-like object, but GeoAxes implements it differently as a method.

The fix would likely need to modify how AxisGrid handles different types of axes objects, particularly checking for and accommodating cases where the axis attribute is a method rather than a dictionary-like object.
