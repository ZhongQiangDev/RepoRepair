Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when using `Axes.set_xticks/Axis.set_ticks`, if ticklabels are provided as a keyword argument (e.g., `xticklabels`) but `labels` parameter is not set, the ticklabels are silently ignored without any validation. This means users might think they're setting tick labels when they're actually not.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the validation of kwargs (keyword arguments) in these functions is only performed when the `labels` parameter is explicitly set. This means any tick label related kwargs are simply ignored when `labels` is not provided, rather than being validated or raising an error to inform users of potential misuse.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/artist.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

lib/matplotlib/axis.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/axis.py
class: Axis
class: Ticker
```
The Axis class is the main class responsible for managing axis properties including ticks and labels. The Ticker class handles tick positioning and formatting. These are directly related to the issue since they handle tick and label management.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: xticks
```
The xticks function is a high-level interface for setting x-axis ticks and labels, which would ultimately call into the Axis class methods.

The other files in the provided information do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to the tick label validation issue.

The core of the issue lies in the Axis class's tick-related methods and their handling of keyword arguments for tick labels. The validation of these arguments should be performed regardless of whether the `labels` parameter is set.
