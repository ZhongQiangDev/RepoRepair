Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when plotting 3D lines in matplotlib. After providing a numpy array to `x_s_0[n]`, an error about input dimensions occurs. Subsequently, even when providing integer values, an AttributeError stating 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' appears. This error persists until the kernel is restarted.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be related to the internal state management of Line3D objects in matplotlib's 3D plotting system. When an invalid input (numpy array with incorrect dimensions) is provided, it corrupts the internal state of the Line3D object. This corruption persists even when valid inputs are later provided, suggesting a problem with the Line3D object's initialization or data handling.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/artist.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/artist.py
class: Artist
function: draw_wrapper
```
This file is relevant because the Artist class is the base class for all drawable objects in matplotlib, and the error occurs during drawing. The draw_wrapper function is specifically mentioned in the error traceback.

lib/matplotlib/lines.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/lines.py
class: Line2D
```
This file is relevant as Line2D is the parent class for Line3D objects, and the error relates to line plotting functionality.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: plot
function: draw
function: show
```
This file is relevant as it contains the high-level plotting functions that are being used in the example code, and the error manifests during plot rendering.

The other files in the provided information do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to this specific 3D line plotting issue and its error handling.

The error specifically mentions '_verts3d' which would be a property of Line3D objects, but interestingly, the Line3D class definition is not provided in the available files. This suggests the issue might be in a different file (likely mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d) that wasn't included in the provided information.
