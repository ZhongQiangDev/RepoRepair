Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails with a KeyError when trying to access the "seaborn-colorblind" style from matplotlib.pyplot.style.library in matplotlib version 3.6.1, while it works fine in version 3.4.3.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to a change in how matplotlib handles style names between versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1. The "seaborn-colorblind" style name was likely renamed or removed in the newer version, causing the KeyError when trying to access it using the old name.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

lib/matplotlib/cm.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
class: _DeprecatedCmapDictWrapper
function: _gen_cmap_registry
```
These are relevant because they handle colormap registration and deprecation warnings, which could be related to style changes.

lib/matplotlib/colors.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
function: style
```
This is relevant as it's part of the style handling system that caused the error.

lib/matplotlib/style/core.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/style/core.py
function: load_base_library
function: reload_library
function: update_user_library
function: use
```
These functions are highly relevant as they handle the loading and management of style libraries, which is directly related to the issue of accessing style names.

The issue likely stems from changes in how styles are registered and accessed in the style library system. The style name "seaborn-colorblind" was probably deprecated or renamed, but the deprecation warning or migration path wasn't properly communicated to users. The functions in style/core.py would be the primary location where this change would need to be addressed.
