Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The colorbar fails to update properly after changing the norm of the mappable object. Specifically:
- `colorbar.update_normal(mappable)` has no effect
- `colorbar.update_bruteforce(mappable)` throws a ZeroDivisionError

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue occurs because:
- When changing the norm of the mappable object (plot.norm = LogNorm()), the colorbar is not properly notified of this change
- The colorbar's internal state doesn't properly handle the new logarithmic normalization
- The ZeroDivisionError suggests that somewhere in the normalization process, a zero value is being used as a divisor, likely due to improper handling of the log scale transformation

3. Examining Files:

lib/matplotlib/cm.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
class: ScalarMappable
```
This class is relevant as it handles the norm and colormap management for the plot object.

lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py
class: Colorbar
```
This class is directly relevant as it handles the colorbar updates and contains the methods that are failing.

lib/matplotlib/colors.py:
```
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
class: LogNorm
class: Normalize
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the normalization that's causing the issue.

The problem appears to be a combination of:
1. The ScalarMappable not properly notifying the colorbar of norm changes
2. The Colorbar class not properly handling the norm update
3. The LogNorm implementation potentially not handling edge cases correctly

The other files and functions/classes are not directly relevant to this specific issue as they deal with color conversion, mapping, and other unrelated functionality.
