Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Request class's handling of hooks doesn't properly support multiple hook functions per hook type. When passing a list of hook functions in the hooks argument, the code wraps this list in another list, making it uncallable when the hooks are executed.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from how the Request class initializes and processes the hooks dictionary in its __init__ method. When a list of hook functions is provided, instead of treating it as multiple hooks to be executed sequentially, the code incorrectly wraps it in another list, creating a nested structure that can't be called as a function.

3. File Analysis:

requests/hooks.py:
```
requests/hooks.py
function: dispatch_hook
```
This function is relevant as it's responsible for executing the hooks, and needs to properly handle both single functions and lists of functions.

requests/models.py:
```
requests/models.py
class: Request
```
This class is directly relevant as it contains the initialization logic that's causing the issue with hook handling.

requests/sessions.py:
```
requests/sessions.py
class: Session
```
This class is relevant as it manages hooks at the session level and needs to properly merge them with request-level hooks.

The issue likely needs to be addressed in both the Request class initialization and how dispatch_hook handles the hook execution. The Session class is included because it's involved in managing hooks at a higher level and needs to ensure proper hook handling when merging session-level and request-level hooks.
