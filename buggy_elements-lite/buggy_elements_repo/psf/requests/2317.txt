Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When making HTTP requests, the method parameter (e.g., 'GET') is being converted from a binary string (b'GET') to a literal string "b'GET'"
- This incorrect conversion causes 404 Not Found responses
- The issue occurs in Python 3.4 but not in Python 2.6

2. Cause Analysis:
- The root cause appears to be in the string encoding/decoding process
- neutronclient uses `utils.safe_encode_list()` which converts values to binary strings
- requests library's `builtin_str(method)` is converting the binary string to a literal string representation
- This creates a method string with the 'b' prefix included, making it an invalid HTTP method

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
requests/api.py
function: request
```
This is relevant as it's the main entry point for making HTTP requests and handles the method parameter.

```
requests/models.py
class: Request
```
This class is relevant as it processes the HTTP method and constructs the actual request.

```
requests/sessions.py
class: Session
```
This is relevant as it handles the request processing and method handling at the session level.

The issue likely needs to be fixed in how the method parameter is processed, either by:
1. Properly decoding the binary string before using it
2. Handling binary string methods directly
3. Modifying how `builtin_str()` handles binary strings in this context

The other files and functions don't appear to be directly related to the method string handling issue.
