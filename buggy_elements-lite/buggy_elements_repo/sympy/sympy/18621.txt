Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to convert a BlockDiagMatrix with a single matrix element back to a regular Matrix. The conversion raises a TypeError with message "'One' object is not subscriptable". However, the conversion works correctly when the BlockDiagMatrix contains two or more matrix elements.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the `_entry` method of BlockDiagMatrix when trying to access elements. When there's only one block, the indexing operation treats it differently than when there are multiple blocks. The error message suggests that instead of getting a proper matrix block, it's getting a 'One' object which cannot be subscripted (indexed).

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
class: BlockDiagMatrix
class: BlockMatrix
```

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: MatrixExpr
```

```
sympy/matrices/dense.py
class: DenseMatrix
```

The other files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The issue primarily stems from the BlockDiagMatrix class's handling of single-block cases. The BlockDiagMatrix inherits from BlockMatrix which in turn inherits from MatrixExpr. The conversion to a regular Matrix involves the DenseMatrix class. The error occurs during the element access operations when converting from BlockDiagMatrix to regular Matrix format.

The core of the problem appears to be in the BlockDiagMatrix's implementation, particularly how it handles the case of a single diagonal block differently from multiple blocks. The error suggests that the indexing operation is not properly handling the single-block case, treating it as a 'One' object instead of a proper matrix block.
