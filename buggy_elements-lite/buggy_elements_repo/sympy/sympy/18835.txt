Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that the `uniq` function in SymPy allows modification of its input list argument while iterating over it, which can lead to incorrect results. This is different from Python's built-in behavior where modifying a dictionary or set during iteration raises a RuntimeError.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that the `uniq` function doesn't check if the input sequence is being modified during iteration. When the input list is modified (via remove() in the example) while uniq is iterating over it, it continues to yield elements but misses some due to the shifting indices caused by the removal operation.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/compatibility.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/utilities/enumerative.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/utilities/iterables.py:
```
sympy/utilities/iterables.py
function: uniq
```
This is the main function that needs to be modified to handle list modifications during iteration. The function currently doesn't implement any checks for list modification during iteration, which is the core issue described in the GitHub problem.

The `uniq` function should be modified to either:
1. Make a copy of the input sequence before processing
2. Add checks for list modifications during iteration
3. Raise a RuntimeError if the sequence is modified during iteration, similar to Python's built-in behavior with dictionaries and sets

No other functions or classes in the provided files are directly relevant to fixing this specific issue.
