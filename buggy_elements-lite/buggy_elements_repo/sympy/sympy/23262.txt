Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when using lambdify to create a function that returns a single-element tuple, SymPy 1.10 generates code that omits the trailing comma, resulting in returning an integer instead of a tuple.

Example:
- Expected (SymPy 1.9): `return (1,)`
- Actual (SymPy 1.10): `return (1)` which evaluates to just the integer 1

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the code generation/printing system where single-element tuples are not being properly handled to include the required trailing comma. This is a Python syntax requirement - without the comma, parentheses around a single value are treated as grouping parentheses rather than tuple construction.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

```
sympy/printing/str.py
class: StrPrinter
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for string representation of SymPy objects, including tuples.

```
sympy/printing/repr.py
class: ReprPrinter
```
This class is relevant as it handles representation of SymPy objects in a form that can be evaluated, which includes proper tuple formatting.

```
sympy/utilities/lambdify.py
function: lambdify
function: lambdastr
```
These functions are directly involved in generating the lambda function code that exhibits the issue.

```
sympy/core/containers.py
class: Tuple
```
This class is relevant as it's the fundamental implementation of tuples in SymPy that needs to be properly printed.

For the remaining files:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue likely stems from either the printing system (StrPrinter/ReprPrinter) not properly handling single-element tuples, or the lambdify/lambdastr functions not properly requesting the tuple representation. The Tuple class itself is involved as the container being printed.
