Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem shows that while SymPy can simplify symbolic trigonometric expressions (sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y) -> cos(x-y)) and rational numbers (1/50 - 1/25 -> -1/50), it fails to simplify trigonometric expressions with rational number arguments. Specifically, sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + cos(1/50)*cos(1/25) is not being simplified to cos(1/50 - 1/25).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the trigonometric simplification logic when dealing with rational number arguments. The simplification functions are not recognizing or properly handling the pattern when the arguments are rational numbers (Rational class instances) instead of symbolic variables. This suggests there might be issues in either:
- The pattern matching logic for trigonometric simplifications
- The handling of rational numbers in trigonometric functions
- The conversion between different forms of number representations

3. Relevant Functions/Classes:

```
sympy/simplify/fu.py
function: TR8
function: TR10
function: futrig
```

```
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
function: trigsimp
function: _trigsimp
function: __trigsimp
```

```
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
class: sin
class: cos
```

```
sympy/polys/domains/pythonrational.py
class: PythonRational
```

The remaining files do not contain directly relevant functions/classes for this specific issue.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between the trigonometric simplification functions (particularly in fu.py and trigsimp.py) and how they handle rational number arguments. The sin and cos classes are relevant as they define the basic trigonometric functions, and PythonRational is relevant as it handles the rational number representation. The simplification functions should recognize that sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + cos(1/50)*cos(1/25) follows the same pattern as sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y), regardless of whether the arguments are symbolic or rational.
