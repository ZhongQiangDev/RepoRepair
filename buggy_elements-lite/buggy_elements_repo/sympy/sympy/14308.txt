Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The pretty printing of vectors with expressions involving powers (like (x/y)^t) shows incorrect formatting with duplicate basis vectors (e_j appears twice)
- The baseline alignment is incorrect - it should be centered but isn't

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the pretty printing logic for vector expressions
- When handling powers in vector expressions, the printer is incorrectly duplicating the basis vector representation
- The baseline alignment issue suggests problems in the pretty printing layout calculations

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/physics/vector/printing.py:
```
sympy/physics/vector/printing.py
class: VectorPrettyPrinter
class: VectorLatexPrinter
function: vpprint
```

sympy/physics/vector/vector.py:
```
sympy/physics/vector/vector.py
class: Vector
```

sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
class: PrettyPrinter
function: pretty
```

sympy/printing/defaults.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/vector/vector.py:
```
sympy/vector/vector.py
class: Vector
class: VectorMul
```

The issue likely stems from the interaction between the vector printing classes (VectorPrettyPrinter) and the base pretty printing system (PrettyPrinter), particularly in how they handle power expressions with vectors. The Vector and VectorMul classes are relevant as they define how vector expressions are structured and manipulated before printing.

The baseline alignment issue would be handled in the PrettyPrinter class's layout logic, while the duplicate basis vector issue is likely in the VectorPrettyPrinter's handling of power expressions.
