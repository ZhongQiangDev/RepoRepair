Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that Symbol instances in SymPy 1.7 have a `__dict__` attribute, while in version 1.6.2 they did not. This is unexpected because Symbol class uses `__slots__` which should prevent instance dictionaries from being created.

2. Cause Analysis:
When a class uses `__slots__`, Python prevents the creation of `__dict__` for instances of that class, optimizing memory usage. The sudden appearance of `__dict__` in Symbol instances suggests that either:
- The `__slots__` definition was accidentally removed from one of the parent classes
- A parent class was added/modified that doesn't use `__slots__`
- The inheritance chain was modified in a way that affects `__slots__` behavior

3. File Analysis:

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
class: Atom
```
These classes are relevant as they are in the inheritance chain of Symbol. The Basic class is the root class, and Atom is a direct parent of Symbol. Any changes to their `__slots__` implementation would affect Symbol instances.

sympy/core/core.py:
```
sympy/core/core.py
class: BasicMeta
```
This metaclass is relevant as it controls class creation behavior for Basic and its descendants, potentially affecting how `__slots__` is handled.

sympy/core/decorators.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/core/singleton.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/core/symbol.py:
```
sympy/core/symbol.py
class: Symbol
```
This is the main class in question where the `__dict__` issue is manifesting. Its implementation of `__slots__` and inheritance structure is directly relevant to the problem.

The issue likely stems from changes in the inheritance chain or `__slots__` implementation in either Basic, Atom, or Symbol classes. The BasicMeta metaclass might also be involved if it affects how class attributes are handled during class creation.
