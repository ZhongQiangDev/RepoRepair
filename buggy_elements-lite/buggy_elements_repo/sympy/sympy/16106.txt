Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails when trying to print an Indexed object using MathML printer, raising a TypeError indicating that 'Indexed' object is not iterable. This happens when trying to use sympy.printing.mathml() on an IndexedBase object with an index.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the MathML printer is trying to iterate over an Indexed object as if it were a container of elements. However, Indexed objects are not meant to be iterable. The printer is attempting to use a generic Basic object printing method that assumes all objects can be iterated over for their arguments, but this assumption is incorrect for Indexed objects.

3. File Analysis:

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
```
This is relevant because it contains the base iteration behavior that's causing problems.

sympy/printing/defaults.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/printing/mathml.py:
```
sympy/printing/mathml.py
class: MathMLPrinter
```
This is directly relevant as it's the printer that's failing to handle Indexed objects properly.

sympy/printing/printer.py:
```
sympy/printing/printer.py
class: Printer
```
This is relevant as it's the base printer class that defines core printing behavior.

sympy/tensor/indexed.py:
```
sympy/tensor/indexed.py
class: Indexed
class: IndexedBase
```
These classes are relevant as they define the objects that are failing to print properly and need to implement proper iteration behavior or have a specific print method added.

The core issue appears to be that the MathMLPrinter needs a specific `_print_Indexed` method to handle Indexed objects properly, rather than trying to iterate over them using the default Basic printing behavior. The Indexed class should either implement proper iteration or have a dedicated printing method.
