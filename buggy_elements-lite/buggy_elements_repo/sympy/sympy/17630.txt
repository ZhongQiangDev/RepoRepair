Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks multiple times. While a single multiplication works correctly, multiplying twice causes an AttributeError because the zeros in the result are of type 'Zero' instead of 'ZeroMatrix', and 'Zero' objects don't have the required 'cols' attribute.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the block matrix multiplication logic where:
- Initial multiplication works because ZeroMatrix objects have the required 'cols' attribute
- The result contains Zero objects (from sympy.core.numbers) instead of ZeroMatrix objects
- When attempting another multiplication, the code tries to access 'cols' on these Zero objects, which doesn't exist
- This suggests an inconsistency in type handling during block matrix operations

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
class: BlockMatrix
function: bc_matmul
function: _blockmul
```
This file contains the core functionality related to block matrix operations and is directly involved in the issue. The BlockMatrix class and its multiplication methods are where the type conversion problem occurs.

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: ZeroMatrix
class: MatrixExpr
```
This file contains the ZeroMatrix class definition which is relevant as it's one of the types involved in the conversion issue. The MatrixExpr base class may also be relevant as it defines common matrix behaviors.

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
function: any_zeros
```
This file contains the any_zeros function which is relevant as it handles zero detection and creation in matrix multiplication operations.

The remaining files in the provided information do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to this specific issue:
```
sympy/matrices/dense.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue primarily involves the interaction between BlockMatrix multiplication operations and zero matrix type handling, with the core problem occurring in the blockmatrix.py file's implementation.
