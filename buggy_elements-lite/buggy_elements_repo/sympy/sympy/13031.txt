Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem shows inconsistent behavior in matrix stacking (hstack) between SymPy 1.0 and 1.1 when dealing with empty matrices. In version 1.0, stacking empty matrices with different column counts correctly adds up the columns (0+1+2+3=6). However, in version 1.1, the hstack operation incorrectly returns a shape of (0,3) instead of (0,6) when stacking empty matrices.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how empty matrices are handled during horizontal stacking operations. The problem specifically manifests when dealing with matrices that have zero rows but different numbers of columns. The fact that it works correctly with non-empty matrices (1 row) suggests that the handling of empty matrices in the stacking operation changed between versions.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

```
sympy/matrices/dense.py
class: DenseMatrix
```
This class is relevant as it handles the basic matrix operations including stacking operations for dense matrices.

```
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
class: MatrixBase
```
This class is relevant as it's the base class for all matrix operations and would contain fundamental matrix manipulation logic.

```
sympy/matrices/sparse.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/matrices/immutable.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue is most likely in the implementation of matrix stacking operations within DenseMatrix or MatrixBase classes. The problem appears to be a regression in how these classes handle the special case of empty matrices during horizontal stacking. The core matrix classes (DenseMatrix and MatrixBase) would be responsible for maintaining the correct dimensionality during such operations.
