Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails when trying to pretty print a matrix addition expression containing a MatrixSymbol with a '*' character in its name ('y*'). The error occurs during the sympification process, indicating an unexpected EOF while parsing.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the code attempting to sympify the string 'y*' as part of handling the matrix symbol name, which is incorrect behavior. Matrix symbol names should be treated as literal strings and not be sympified. The error occurs because '*' is treated as a multiplication operator during sympification rather than as part of the symbol name.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
class: PrettyPrinter
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for the pretty printing functionality where the error manifests.

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: MatrixSymbol
```
This class is relevant as it handles the creation and representation of matrix symbols, which is where the problematic name handling occurs.

```
sympy/core/sympify.py
function: sympify
class: SympifyError
```
These are relevant as they're involved in the incorrect sympification attempt of the matrix symbol name.

```
sympy/core/basic.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/printing/str.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core issue appears to be in the interaction between MatrixSymbol handling and the sympification process. The fix would likely involve modifying how MatrixSymbol names are handled to prevent them from being passed through sympify, or adjusting the pretty printing logic to handle special characters in matrix names correctly.
