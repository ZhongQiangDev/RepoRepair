Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code causes a RecursionError when checking if a complex cosh expression is zero using the is_zero property. The expression involves nested inverse hyperbolic and trigonometric functions: cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that when evaluating whether this expression equals zero, the system enters an infinite recursive loop. This likely happens because:
- The is_zero check triggers evaluation of the expression
- The evaluation involves nested inverse functions (acos, acosh) 
- These nested functions keep calling each other recursively without reaching a base case
- Eventually the Python recursion limit is exceeded

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/assumptions/refine.py:
```
sympy/assumptions/refine.py
function: refine
```
This is relevant because refine is called during expression evaluation and handles recursive processing of expressions.

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
class: preorder_traversal
function: _aresame
```
These are relevant because they handle core expression traversal and comparison which would be involved in checking if an expression is zero.

sympy/core/evalf.py:
```
sympy/core/evalf.py
function: evalf
class: EvalfMixin
```
These handle numerical evaluation which would be triggered when checking if a complex expression is zero.

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This base class provides core expression functionality including evaluation and comparison methods.

sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue appears to be in the interaction between expression evaluation, refinement and traversal when dealing with nested inverse hyperbolic/trigonometric functions. The recursion happens because each function keeps trying to evaluate the others without reaching a termination condition.
