Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The lambdify function incorrectly interprets the Identity matrix in the expression `A + Identity(n)`. When evaluating this expression with a numpy array input, it returns a complex array where each element has been added with 1j (imaginary unit) instead of adding 1 to the diagonal elements.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue occurs because the code printer used by lambdify is printing 'I' for the Identity matrix, which is then interpreted as the Python built-in complex number 1j in the generated lambda function's namespace. This is evident from the inspection of the generated function's source code and globals, where 'I' is bound to 1j.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: Identity
class: MatrixExpr
```
These classes are relevant because they handle the Identity matrix representation and matrix expressions that need to be properly printed.

```
sympy/utilities/lambdify.py
function: lambdify
function: _get_namespace
```
These functions are directly involved in creating the lambda function and managing its namespace where the incorrect interpretation occurs.

```
sympy/printing/pycode.py
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

```
sympy/printing/julia.py
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

```
sympy/matrices/dense.py
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue appears to be in the interaction between the Identity matrix representation and the code generation/namespace management in lambdify. The Identity class needs to be properly handled during code generation to avoid confusion with the complex number 'I', and the namespace management in lambdify needs to ensure correct interpretation of matrix operations.
