Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The SeqFormula() output in Jupyter is displaying backslash-escaped square brackets (`\left\[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots\right\]`) which doesn't render properly when copied to a markdown cell. The desired output should either not escape the brackets or ensure `\]` renders correctly.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how LaTeX formatting is being applied to sequence outputs. When the sequence is rendered, it's using LaTeX formatting that includes escaped brackets, but this escaping isn't compatible with markdown rendering. The problem likely stems from how the sequence is converted to LaTeX representation.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

```
sympy/series/sequences.py
class: SeqFormula
```
This class is directly responsible for creating and representing the sequence that's being displayed. It's the primary source of the sequence data that will be formatted.

```
sympy/printing/latex.py
class: LatexPrinter
function: latex
```
These are responsible for converting SymPy expressions (including sequences) into LaTeX format. The escaping of brackets likely happens here during LaTeX conversion.

```
sympy/interactive/printing.py
function: init_printing
```
This function sets up how SymPy objects are displayed in interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks. It configures the display system and determines which printer (LaTeX, pretty, etc.) to use.

The remaining files (sympy/printing/str.py and sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py) contain no relevant functions/classes as they deal with string and pretty printing respectively, but not with the LaTeX formatting that's causing the issue.

The core issue is likely in how the LatexPrinter handles sequence brackets, and how init_printing configures the display system to use these escaped brackets in Jupyter. The fix would need to modify either the LaTeX generation in LatexPrinter or adjust how init_printing configures the display system for sequences.
