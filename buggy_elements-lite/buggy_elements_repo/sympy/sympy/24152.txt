Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when expanding a TensorProduct object that contains summands with scalar factors. The expansion stops incomplete, only expanding one factor while leaving the other unexpanded. For example:
```python
P = TensorProduct(2*U - V, U + V)
P.expand(tensorproduct=True)
```
Returns: `2*Ux(U + V) - Vx(U + V)`
Instead of the expected full expansion: `2*UxU + 2*UxV - VxU - VxV`

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct() method's handling of scalar factors. When creating a TensorProduct object with scalar coefficients, the constructor returns a Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..)) object. The current implementation fails to properly handle this case, causing incomplete expansion when scalar coefficients are present.

3. Examining Files:

```
sympy/core/coreerrors.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/physics/quantum/qapply.py
function: qapply
function: qapply_Mul
```

```
sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py
class: TensorProduct
function: tensor_product_simp
function: tensor_product_simp_Mul
```

```
sympy/tensor/tensor.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The key relevant locations are in the tensorproduct.py file, particularly the TensorProduct class which contains the problematic _eval_expand_tensorproduct method. The qapply.py functions are also relevant as they rely on the tensor product expansion functionality. The other files, while containing tensor-related code, are not directly involved in this specific issue.
