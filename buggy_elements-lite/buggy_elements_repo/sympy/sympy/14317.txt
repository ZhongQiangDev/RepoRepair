Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The LaTeX printer is not maintaining the same order of monomials as the str and pretty printers. Specifically, in the example:
- str/pretty prints: a*x**5 + x**4 + b*x**3 + 2*x**2 + c*x + 3
- latex prints: a x^{5} + b x^{3} + c x + x^{4} + 2 x^{2} + 3
The terms are rearranged in the LaTeX output, breaking the expected highest-to-lowest degree ordering.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how monomial ordering is handled differently between the LaTeX printer and other printers. The LaTeX printer seems to not respect the same monomial ordering system that's used by str and pretty printers. This likely involves the interaction between the polynomial ordering system and the LaTeX printing logic.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/polys/orderings.py
class: MonomialOrder
class: LexOrder
class: GradedLexOrder
function: monomial_key
```

```
sympy/printing/latex.py
class: LatexPrinter
function: latex
```

```
sympy/printing/printer.py
class: Printer
```

The issue likely stems from the LatexPrinter not properly utilizing the monomial ordering system defined in orderings.py. The MonomialOrder classes and monomial_key function define how terms should be ordered, but this ordering isn't being correctly applied during LaTeX printing.

The base Printer class from printer.py provides the framework for all printers, and the LatexPrinter inherits from it but may not be properly implementing the ordering logic for polynomials.

The problem requires ensuring that the LatexPrinter respects the same monomial ordering system that's used by other printers, likely requiring modifications to how it processes polynomial terms during LaTeX generation.
