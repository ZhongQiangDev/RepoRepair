Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code tries to add two quantities with different dimensions (velocity and acceleration*time), but instead of handling the addition properly by checking dimensional compatibility, it raises a ValueError indicating that the dimensions don't match.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the dimension checking logic within the SI unit system. When adding `a1*t1` (acceleration*time) and `v1` (velocity), the system fails to recognize that acceleration*time and velocity are dimensionally equivalent. Both should have dimensions of length/time, but the system is treating them as incompatible.

3. File Analysis:

```
sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py
This file contains the core issue since it contains the _collect_factor_and_dimension method that raises the error. However, the specific code is not provided in the file information.
```

```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
class: AtomicExpr
These classes are relevant as they handle basic expression operations and may be involved in how dimensional quantities are combined and compared.
```

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/physics/vector/vector.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/vector/vector.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core issue likely lies in the unit system's dimension handling logic in unitsystem.py, particularly in how it processes and compares dimensions during addition operations. The Expr and AtomicExpr classes from core/expr.py are relevant as they provide the foundation for expression handling, which would include how dimensional quantities are processed and combined.

The other files, while containing vector and matrix multiplication functionality, are not directly related to the dimension compatibility issue in the unit system.
