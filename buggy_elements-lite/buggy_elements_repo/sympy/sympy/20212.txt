Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that evaluating `0**-oo` produces `0`, but according to the documentation in the Pow class, it should produce `zoo` (ComplexInfinity).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely stems from the power evaluation logic in the Pow class when dealing with a zero base and negative infinite exponent. This is a special case that should return ComplexInfinity (zoo) according to the documentation, but the implementation is not handling this case correctly.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/core/mul.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/core/numbers.py:
```
sympy/core/numbers.py
class: ComplexInfinity
```

sympy/core/power.py:
```
sympy/core/power.py
class: Pow
```

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue is primarily related to the power evaluation logic in the Pow class and its interaction with ComplexInfinity (zoo). The Pow class handles the evaluation of expressions like `0**-oo`, while ComplexInfinity represents the expected result value. The implementation in Pow class needs to be checked and corrected to properly handle the case where the base is zero and the exponent is negative infinity, ensuring it returns ComplexInfinity as documented.
