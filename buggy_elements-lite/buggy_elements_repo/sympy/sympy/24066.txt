Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to evaluate the dimensionality of an exponential expression where the exponent contains physical units. The function `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` incorrectly reports that `exp(second/(farad*ohm))` has dimensions of `time/(capacitance*impedance)`, when it should be dimensionless.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the exponential function's special property - that its output should always be dimensionless regardless of its input's dimensions - is not being properly handled. When physical units are involved in an exponent, the result should be dimensionless, but the dimension tracking system is treating the exponent's dimensions as if they contribute to the final dimensions.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py
class: exp
class: ExpBase
```
These classes are relevant as they handle exponential operations and should potentially include dimension handling logic.

```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This base class is relevant as it handles core expression operations and might need modifications to properly handle dimensions in special functions like exponentials.

```
sympy/core/function.py
class: Function
```
This class is relevant as it's the base class for mathematical functions and might need to include special handling for dimensional analysis.

The remaining files (sympify.py) contains no relevant functions/classes.

The fix would likely involve modifying how dimensions are handled specifically for exponential functions, ensuring that the output is always treated as dimensionless regardless of the input dimensions.
