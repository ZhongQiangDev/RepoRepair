Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that `lambdify` fails with a SyntaxError when trying to create a lambda function from a MatrixSymbol that has curly braces in its name, even when dummify=True is set. This is inconsistent with the fact that it works fine for:
- Regular symbols with curly braces
- MatrixSymbols without curly braces

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the handling of special characters (like curly braces) during the lambdification process. While the dummify option is meant to replace problematic symbols with safe dummy variables, it seems this replacement isn't being properly applied to MatrixSymbols. The curly braces in the symbol name are likely being passed through to the lambda string generation, resulting in invalid Python syntax.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

sympy/core/symbol.py:
```
sympy/core/symbol.py
class: Symbol
class: Dummy
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the basic symbol creation and dummy variable generation that's supposed to handle special characters.

sympy/core/sympify.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: MatrixSymbol
```
This class is relevant as it's the direct type involved in the issue.

sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py:
```
sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py
class: LambdaPrinter
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for converting expressions into string representations for lambda functions.

sympy/utilities/lambdify.py:
```
sympy/utilities/lambdify.py
function: lambdify
function: lambdastr
```
These functions are directly involved in the conversion process and the final lambda function generation where the error occurs.

The issue likely stems from an interaction between MatrixSymbol naming and the lambdify/dummify process, where the special character handling isn't being properly applied to matrix symbol names during the conversion to lambda string representation.
