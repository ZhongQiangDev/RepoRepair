Let me help analyze this step by step.

1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves inconsistent results when using the `apart()` function with symbolic expressions. Specifically:
- When `bug.subs(a, 1).apart()` is called, it returns `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`
- When `bug.apart(t)` is called, it returns `-a*t`
These results are inconsistent, as substituting a=1 should give equivalent results.

2. Analyzing the Cause:
The problem appears to be in how the `apart()` function handles expressions with symbolic coefficients (like 'a') versus numeric coefficients. The function seems to fail to properly decompose the fraction when the coefficient 'a' is present, leading to an oversimplified result `-a*t` instead of the correct partial fraction decomposition.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

```
sympy/core/add.py
class: Add
```
The Add class is relevant as it handles addition operations and term combinations, which are part of the partial fraction decomposition process.

```
sympy/core/mul.py
class: Mul
function: _unevaluated_Mul
```
The Mul class and _unevaluated_Mul function are relevant as they handle multiplication operations and coefficient handling, which are crucial for proper partial fraction decomposition.

```
sympy/core/power.py
class: Pow
```
The Pow class is relevant as it handles exponentiation operations which are involved in the denominator term (2*t - 1).

```
sympy/simplify/radsimp.py
function: fraction
function: collect
```
These functions are relevant as they handle fraction manipulation and term collection, which are fundamental operations in partial fraction decomposition.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between these components, particularly in how they handle symbolic versus numeric coefficients during partial fraction decomposition. The fraction handling in radsimp.py combined with the multiplication and addition operations in mul.py and add.py appears to be treating the symbolic coefficient 'a' differently from numeric coefficients, leading to the inconsistent results.
