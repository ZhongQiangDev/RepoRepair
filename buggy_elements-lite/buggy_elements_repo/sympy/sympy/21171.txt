Let me help analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to print a shear force calculation that contains a SingularityFunction. The specific error is "TypeError: _print_SingularityFunction() got an unexpected keyword argument 'exp'", indicating a problem with LaTeX printing of SingularityFunction objects.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the LaTeX printing system when it tries to handle a power expression containing a SingularityFunction. The _print_Pow method in LatexPrinter is passing an 'exp' argument to _print_SingularityFunction, but this method doesn't accept that parameter. This suggests a mismatch between how power expressions are handled for SingularityFunction objects versus other types.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/function.py:
```
sympy/core/function.py
class: Function
class: FunctionClass
```
These are relevant as they define the base functionality for all functions, including SingularityFunction.

sympy/core/power.py:
```
sympy/core/power.py
class: Pow
```
This is relevant as it's involved in the power expression handling that triggers the error.

sympy/integrals/singularityfunctions.py:
```
sympy/integrals/singularityfunctions.py
function: singularityintegrate
```
This is relevant as it handles SingularityFunction operations, though it's missing proper LaTeX printing support.

sympy/printing/latex.py:
```
sympy/printing/latex.py
class: LatexPrinter
function: latex
```
These are directly relevant as they handle LaTeX printing and contain the code that's triggering the error.

sympy/printing/printer.py:
```
sympy/printing/printer.py
class: Printer
```
This is relevant as the base class for all printers, including LatexPrinter.
