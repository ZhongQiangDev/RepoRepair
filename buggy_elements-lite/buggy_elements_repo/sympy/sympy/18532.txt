Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `expr.atoms()` method currently returns subclasses of `Atom` in the expression, but it should instead return objects that have no `.args` (leaf nodes).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the implementation of the atoms traversal logic, where it's using class inheritance (checking for `is_Atom`) as the criterion for what constitutes an atomic element, rather than checking for the absence of arguments (`.args`). This means some objects that shouldn't be considered atomic (because they have arguments) are being included in the results just because they inherit from the `Atom` class.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
class: preorder_traversal
function: _atomic
```
This file contains the core traversal and atomic detection logic. The `Basic` class likely contains the `atoms()` method, `preorder_traversal` is used for tree traversal, and `_atomic` is directly related to determining what constitutes an atomic element.

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
The `Expr` class likely inherits from `Basic` and may override or extend the atoms functionality.

sympy/core/function.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue is primarily about the traversal and atomic detection logic in basic.py and expr.py, not about function definitions or applications.
