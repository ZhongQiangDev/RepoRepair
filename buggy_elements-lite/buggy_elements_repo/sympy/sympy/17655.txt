Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when trying to multiply a number with a Point object in different orders:
- `point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works correctly
- `sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError and GeometryError

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to the order of multiplication between a number and a Point object. When the Point is on the left side, it likely has a proper `__mul__` method handling the multiplication. However, when the number is on the left side, Python calls the number's `__mul__` method first, which doesn't know how to handle Point objects, leading to the TypeError. This suggests an issue with the commutative property implementation in the multiplication operation.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/geometry/point.py
class: Point
class: Point2D
```
These classes are directly involved as they handle Point operations and should implement multiplication methods.

```
sympy/core/mul.py
class: Mul
function: _unevaluated_Mul
```
These are relevant as they handle multiplication operations in SymPy and need to properly handle geometric entities.

```
sympy/geometry/entity.py
class: GeometryEntity
```
This base class is relevant as it should provide basic arithmetic operation support for geometric objects.

The remaining files (sympy/core/basic.py, sympy/core/sympify.py) contain no relevant functions/classes for this specific multiplication order issue.

The fix would likely involve implementing proper `__rmul__` method in the Point class or modifying the Mul class to better handle geometric entities in either multiplication order.
