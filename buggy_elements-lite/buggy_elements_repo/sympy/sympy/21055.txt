Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `refine()` function fails to simplify complex arguments like `arg(a)` and `abs(a)` even when there are explicit assumptions about `a` being positive. As shown in the example:
```python
refine(abs(a),Q.positive(a)) # returns a (correct)
refine(arg(a),Q.positive(a)) # returns arg(a) (incorrect - should be 0)
```

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be that while `refine()` correctly handles `abs(a)` when `a` is positive, it doesn't properly handle the `arg(a)` function under the same assumptions. For a positive real number, its argument (angle in complex plane) should be 0. This suggests that either:
- The `arg` class doesn't have proper refinement logic for positive numbers
- The `refine()` function isn't properly handling complex-related functions
- The assumption system isn't correctly propagating positivity information to complex argument calculations

3. Relevant Functions/Classes:

```
sympy/assumptions/refine.py
function: refine
```

```
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
class: arg
class: Abs
```

```
sympy/simplify/simplify.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/assumptions/assume.py
class: AppliedPredicate
```

```
sympy/assumptions/sathandlers.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue primarily involves the interaction between the `refine` function and the `arg` class, with `AppliedPredicate` handling the assumption logic. The `Abs` class is included as it demonstrates the correct behavior we want to replicate for `arg`. The other files don't contain directly relevant code for this specific issue.
