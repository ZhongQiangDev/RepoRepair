Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `col_insert()` method is not correctly handling the identity matrix portion when inserting columns. When inserting two columns at position 3 in a 6x6 identity matrix, the remaining identity matrix portion (columns 4-6 of original matrix) appears shifted up in the output matrix instead of maintaining its original row positions.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the column insertion handles the shifting and placement of existing columns. When inserting new columns, the method seems to be incorrectly repositioning the remaining columns of the identity matrix, causing them to shift upward instead of maintaining their original row positions. This suggests a potential issue in the column insertion logic or matrix manipulation code.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/matrices/common.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/matrices/dense.py:
```
sympy/matrices/dense.py
class: DenseMatrix
class: MutableDenseMatrix
```

sympy/matrices/matrices.py:
```
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
class: MatrixBase
class: ShapeError
```

The issue is likely in the implementation of column insertion methods within these matrix classes. The `MatrixBase` class would contain the base implementation of matrix operations, while `DenseMatrix` and `MutableDenseMatrix` would provide the specific implementations for dense matrices. The `col_insert()` method would be part of these classes' functionality.

The `ShapeError` class is relevant as it handles matrix dimension validation, which could be involved in column insertion operations.

The other functions in the provided files don't appear directly relevant to the column insertion functionality that's showing incorrect behavior.
