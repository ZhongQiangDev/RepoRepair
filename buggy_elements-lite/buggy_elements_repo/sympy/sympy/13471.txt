Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to pickle a SymPy expression containing a float in Python 2 and then unpickling it in Python 3. The error message indicates that there's a problem converting a string '1L' to an integer with base 16, suggesting an incompatibility in how long integers are handled between Python 2 and 3.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be related to how Python 2's long integers (which append 'L' to their string representation) are handled when being unpickled in Python 3. When the float-containing expression is pickled in Python 2, it likely includes long integers with 'L' suffix, but Python 3's unpickling process fails to handle this legacy format correctly.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

sympy/core/compatibility.py:
```
sympy/core/compatibility.py
function: as_int
```
This function is relevant as it handles integer conversion and could be involved in the unpickling process.

sympy/core/evalf.py:
```
sympy/core/evalf.py
function: evalf_add
function: evalf_mul
```
These functions are relevant as they handle floating-point arithmetic operations which are part of the problematic expression.

sympy/core/numbers.py:
```
sympy/core/numbers.py
class: Float
class: Integer
function: sympify_mpq
```
These are relevant as they handle the numeric types involved in the expression and their conversions.

sympy/core/sympify.py:
```
sympy/core/sympify.py
function: sympify
```
This function is relevant as it's responsible for converting Python objects into SymPy objects during unpickling.

sympy/polys/polyutils.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between Integer/Float classes and the sympify/as_int functions when handling pickled data from Python 2 to Python 3. The error occurs specifically in the number conversion process, suggesting these components are the most relevant to the problem.
