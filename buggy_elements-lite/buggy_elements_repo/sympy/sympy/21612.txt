Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when parsing a LaTeX expression containing nested fractions. The expression:
`"\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"`

Currently parses to: `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)`
Expected result: `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`

The issue is that the denominator's fraction is not properly bracketed, leading to incorrect operator precedence.

2. Analyzing the Cause:
The root cause appears to be in the LaTeX parsing logic where nested fractions are not properly handled. Specifically, when parsing the denominator fraction `\frac{1}{c^2}`, it's not being treated as a single unit, causing the division operations to be evaluated from left to right instead of maintaining the proper fraction structure.

3. Examining Relevant Files:
Looking through the provided files, most of them deal with polynomial operations, number theory, and printing functionality rather than LaTeX parsing. The files shown don't contain the actual LaTeX parsing code which would be in a different module (likely in sympy/parsing/latex/).

For the provided files:

sympy/core/exprtools.py:
```
sympy/core/exprtools.py
function: decompose_power
```
This function could be tangentially related as it handles power expressions which appear in the fraction, but it's not the primary cause.

sympy/core/numbers.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/polys/polytools.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/printing/str.py:
```
sympy/printing/str.py
class: StrPrinter
```
This class handles string representation of expressions and could be involved in how the final expression is displayed, though it's not the root cause of the parsing issue.

The actual fix would likely need to be made in the LaTeX parsing module (sympy/parsing/latex/) which is not included in the provided files. The parser needs to properly handle nested fractions by ensuring proper bracketing of denominators.
