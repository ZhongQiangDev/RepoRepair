Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Mathematica code printer incorrectly handles Derivative expressions, outputting "Derivative(f(t), t)" instead of the correct Mathematica syntax "D[f[t],t]"
- Float numbers with exponents are not properly formatted for Mathematica (e.g., "1.0e-4" should be "1.0*^-4")

2. Cause Analysis:
- The MCodePrinter class lacks proper methods to handle Derivative expressions and Float numbers
- The printer needs specific methods _print_Derivative and _print_Float to convert these expressions into Mathematica's syntax
- The current implementation likely falls back to default string representation instead of using Mathematica-specific formatting

3. File Analysis:

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This class is relevant as it's the base class for expressions that need to be printed.

sympy/core/function.py:
```
sympy/core/function.py
class: Derivative
class: Function
```
These classes are relevant as they define the Derivative functionality that needs proper printing support.

sympy/printing/mathematica.py:
```
sympy/printing/mathematica.py
class: MCodePrinter
function: mathematica_code
```
This is the main file where the fix needs to be implemented, as it contains the printer class responsible for Mathematica code generation.

sympy/printing/printer.py:
```
sympy/printing/printer.py
class: Printer
```
This is relevant as it's the base printer class that MCodePrinter inherits from and defines core printing functionality.

sympy/printing/str.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
