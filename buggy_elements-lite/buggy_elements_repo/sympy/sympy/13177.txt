Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that `Mod(x**2, x)` incorrectly returns 0 when x is not an integer. For example, when x = 1.5, `Mod(1.5**2, 1.5)` should return 0.75 but SymPy returns 0.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem lies in the evaluation logic of the Mod class. The current logic assumes that if p is a power (p.is_Pow) and the exponent is an integer (p.exp.is_Integer) and the base matches q, then the result should be 0. However, this assumption is only valid when the base is also an integer. The code doesn't check if the base is an integer before making this simplification.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/core/mod.py
class: Mod
```
This is the primary class where the issue exists, as it contains the evaluation logic that incorrectly simplifies modulo operations involving powers.

```
sympy/core/power.py
class: Pow
```
The Pow class is relevant because it handles power operations and its properties (like is_Integer) are used in the Mod class's evaluation logic.

The remaining files (numbers.py) contain no relevant functions/classes. While they define various number types and constants, they don't directly contribute to the modulo evaluation logic that's causing the issue.

The fix would need to modify the Mod class's evaluation logic to check if the base is an integer before applying the power-related simplification rule.
