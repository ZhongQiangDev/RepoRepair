Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that `sympy.Array([])` fails with a ValueError when trying to create an empty array, while `sympy.Matrix([])` works fine. The error occurs during the array creation process when trying to unpack values from an empty iterator.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the array creation process, specifically in the `_scan_iterable_shape` method of `NDimArray` class. When an empty list is provided, the function attempts to unpack two values (elements and shapes) from an empty list comprehension using `zip(*[f(i) for i in pointer])`, which raises the ValueError.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py:
```
sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py
class: DenseNDimArray
class: ImmutableDenseNDimArray
```

sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py:
```
sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py
class: NDimArray
```

sympy/matrices/dense.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/matrices/matrices.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/core/basic.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue stems from the array creation process in the NDimArray class and its subclasses DenseNDimArray and ImmutableDenseNDimArray. The _scan_iterable_shape method in NDimArray class needs to handle empty lists properly. The Matrix class has a different implementation that correctly handles empty lists, which explains why Matrix([]) works while Array([]) fails.
