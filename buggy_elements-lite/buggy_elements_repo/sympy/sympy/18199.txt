Let me help analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `nthroot_mod` function fails to include 0 as a root when solving the equation x^n ≡ a mod p in cases where a ≡ 0 mod p. Specifically, in the example given, `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)` should include 0 as a root since 0^5 ≡ 0 mod 17, but it doesn't.

2. Cause Analysis:
When a ≡ 0 mod p, x = 0 is always a solution to x^n ≡ a mod p because 0^n ≡ 0 mod p for any positive integer n. The current implementation appears to miss this special case check, leading to incomplete solutions.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/power.py:
```
sympy/core/power.py
function: integer_nthroot
```
This function is relevant as it handles nth root calculations and could be involved in the modular root finding process.

sympy/ntheory/modular.py:
```
sympy/ntheory/modular.py
function: solve_congruence
function: linear_congruence
```
These functions are relevant as they handle congruence equations and could be involved in solving modular equations.

sympy/polys/galoistools.py:
```
sympy/polys/galoistools.py
function: gf_value
function: gf_eval
```
These functions are relevant as they handle polynomial evaluation in Galois Fields, which is crucial for modular arithmetic operations.

The other files contain supporting functions but are not directly related to the root-finding issue described in the problem.

The fix would likely involve adding a check in the nthroot_mod function (which isn't shown in the provided files) to handle the special case where a ≡ 0 mod p by including 0 as a solution.
