Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that when subtracting two identical expressions involving fractional exponents (2.5 or 5/2), the result is not being simplified to 0. Instead, it shows:
`-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5`

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how SymPy handles floating-point exponents versus rational exponents. Even though `2.5` and `S(5)/2` represent the same value, the expressions are not being recognized as identical during simplification. This suggests a problem in either:
- The power simplification logic
- The floating-point to rational conversion
- The general simplification routines

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This is relevant as it handles basic expression operations and simplification.

sympy/core/power.py:
```
sympy/core/power.py
class: Pow
```
This is highly relevant as it handles power operations and their simplification.

sympy/simplify/simplify.py:
```
sympy/simplify/simplify.py
function: simplify
function: _real_to_rational
```
These are relevant for handling general simplification and converting floating-point numbers to rationals.

sympy/simplify/powsimp.py:
```
sympy/simplify/powsimp.py
function: powsimp
```
This is relevant for simplifying power expressions.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely stems from the interaction between Pow class handling and the floating-point to rational conversion in simplification routines.
