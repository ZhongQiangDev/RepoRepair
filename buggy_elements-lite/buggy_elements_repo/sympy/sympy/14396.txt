Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to create a polynomial with domain='RR[y,z]'. The code raises an OptionError saying "expected a valid domain specification, got RR[y,z]".

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the domain parsing logic. While the code can handle basic domains like 'RR' and polynomial rings like 'Z[x]', it doesn't properly handle polynomial rings over real numbers with multiple variables ('RR[y,z]'). This suggests a limitation in the domain parsing functionality.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/polys/polyoptions.py:
```
sympy/polys/polyoptions.py
class: Domain
```

sympy/polys/polytools.py:
```
sympy/polys/polytools.py
class: Poly
function: poly_from_expr
```

sympy/polys/domains/domain.py:
```
sympy/polys/domains/domain.py
class: Domain
```

sympy/polys/domains/polynomialring.py:
```
sympy/polys/domains/polynomialring.py
class: PolynomialRing
```

sympy/polys/domains/compositedomain.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue appears to be in the Domain class in polyoptions.py, where the domain parsing logic needs to be enhanced to handle polynomial rings over real numbers with multiple variables.
