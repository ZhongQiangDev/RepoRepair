Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` expression returns `bell(oo)` instead of evaluating to infinity (oo). This is incorrect because Bell numbers, which count the number of ways to partition a set, should grow without bound as n approaches infinity.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be that the limit evaluation system doesn't properly handle the Bell numbers function when taking its limit to infinity. Similar to recently fixed issues with Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, the Bell numbers should evaluate to infinity when n approaches infinity, but instead, it's returning an unevaluated form `bell(oo)`.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py
class: bell
```
This is the primary class that needs modification as it defines the Bell numbers functionality.

```
sympy/series/limits.py
class: Limit
function: limit
```
These handle the limit evaluation process and would need to properly interact with the Bell numbers function.

```
sympy/series/gruntz.py
function: gruntz
function: mrv_leadterm
```
These functions are responsible for computing limits using the Gruntz algorithm, which should handle the Bell numbers case.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The fix would likely involve modifying the `bell` class to properly handle limit evaluation when n approaches infinity, similar to how the Fibonacci and Lucas number functions were fixed. The limit evaluation system would then be able to correctly compute the limit through the interaction between these components.
