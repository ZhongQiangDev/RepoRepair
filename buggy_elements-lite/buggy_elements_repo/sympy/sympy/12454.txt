Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `is_upper()` method raises an IndexError when called on a 4x2 matrix of zeros. The error occurs when trying to access index (3,2) which is out of bounds for a 4x2 matrix.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the implementation of `is_upper()` which generates indices incorrectly for non-square matrices. For a 4x2 matrix, it tries to access index (3,2) which is invalid since the matrix only has 2 columns. The method assumes the matrix is square when generating indices for checking upper triangularity.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
class: MatrixBase
```
This class is relevant as it contains the base implementation of matrix operations including `is_upper()` which is causing the issue.

```
sympy/matrices/dense.py
class: DenseMatrix
```
This class is relevant as it implements the matrix storage and access methods that are involved in the error, particularly the `__getitem__` method that raises the IndexError.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes as they deal with:
- sympy/interactive/ipythonprinting.py: IPython printing functionality
- sympy/matrices/immutable.py: Immutable matrix implementations
- sympy/matrices/sparse.py: Sparse matrix implementations
- sympy/polys/domains/pythonfinitefield.py: Finite field implementations
- sympy/polys/domains/pythonintegerring.py: Integer ring implementations
- sympy/polys/domains/pythonrational.py: Rational number implementations
- sympy/polys/domains/pythonrationalfield.py: Rational field implementations
- sympy/printing/python.py: Python code printing functionality

The core issue lies in the matrix base class implementation and dense matrix access methods, which are found in the two files identified above.
