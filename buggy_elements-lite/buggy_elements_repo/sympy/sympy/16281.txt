Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior Identification:
- The Product pretty printing has an unnecessary empty line at the bottom of the ∏ symbol
- The ∏ symbol appears too wide/fat in the output
- The top bar could potentially be extended for better aesthetics

2. Cause Analysis:
The issues appear to stem from the pretty printing implementation for Product objects, specifically how the ASCII/Unicode art is constructed for the product symbol. The empty line and width issues suggest the stringPict class (which handles ASCII art construction) may not be optimally configured for Product symbol rendering.

3. File-by-File Analysis:

sympy/concrete/products.py:
```
sympy/concrete/products.py
class: Product
```
This class is relevant as it defines the product object that needs pretty printing.

sympy/core/mul.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/interactive/printing.py:
```
sympy/interactive/printing.py
function: init_printing
```
This is relevant as it initializes the printing system and its configuration.

sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
class: PrettyPrinter
function: pretty
function: pretty_print
```
These are directly relevant as they handle the actual pretty printing implementation.

sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py
class: stringPict
class: prettyForm
```
These classes are crucial as they handle the actual ASCII/Unicode art construction for mathematical symbols, including the product symbol's appearance.

The core of the issue likely lies in how the PrettyPrinter class uses stringPict and prettyForm to construct the product symbol, particularly in terms of vertical spacing and character width choices.
