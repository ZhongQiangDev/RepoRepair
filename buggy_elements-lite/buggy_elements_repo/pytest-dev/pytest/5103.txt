Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior Identification:
The issue is about poor error reporting when using Python's built-in `all()`/`any()` functions in test assertions. When these functions are used with generator expressions or list comprehensions, the error messages are not helpful for debugging because they don't show which specific element caused the assertion to fail.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism doesn't "unroll" iterables when handling `all()`/`any()` functions. This results in:
- For generator expressions: Only showing the generator object
- For list comprehensions: Showing a truncated list of results
- Neither approach shows which specific input value caused the failure

3. Examining Relevant Files:

testing/python/approx.py:
```
Class: TestApprox
```
This class is somewhat relevant as it deals with assertions and testing, particularly around comparing values and handling different types of iterables. While it doesn't directly address the `all()`/`any()` issue, its implementation of iterable testing and assertion messages could provide insights for implementing the proposed enhancement.

The class includes test methods that work with iterables and custom assertion messages, which is related to the core problem of improving assertion messages for iterable operations.

The other classes in this file (`MyDocTestRunner` and `MySizedIterable`) are not directly relevant to the `all()`/`any()` assertion rewriting issue.

Note: The actual fix for this issue would likely require modifications to pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism, which isn't shown in the provided files. The core changes would need to be made in pytest's assertion handling code to implement the suggested "unrolling" of iterables during assertion evaluation.
