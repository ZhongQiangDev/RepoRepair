Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that pytest incorrectly caches the evaluation of string conditions in skipif/xfail markers. When the same string condition is used in different test modules with different global variables, pytest uses the cached result instead of re-evaluating the condition in the new context.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that the caching mechanism in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py` only uses the string itself as the cache key, without considering the test item's globals. This means that once a string condition is evaluated, its result is reused for all subsequent evaluations, even if the global context has changed.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

testing/python/collect.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/python/metafunc.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/python/raises.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

None of the provided files appear to contain code directly related to the skipif/xfail marker evaluation or caching mechanism. The issue is mentioned to be in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`, which is not included in the provided files.

The core of the issue would likely be in the `cached_eval` function within `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`, but this file is not provided in the relevant files information. The provided test files are focused on other pytest functionality like test collection, metafunctions, and exception handling.

To fix this issue, we would need to examine and modify the caching mechanism in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`, possibly by including the test item's globals as part of the cache key or, as suggested in the issue, by removing the caching altogether.
