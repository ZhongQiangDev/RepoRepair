Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that the `--collect-only` command in pytest requires typing a long argument string, which is inconvenient for users who frequently need this functionality. There is currently no short-form alternative (like a single character flag) available.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in pytest's command-line argument parsing system, where the `--collect-only` option is defined but lacks a short-form alias. This is likely defined in the core argument parsing setup of pytest.

3. Examining Relevant Files:
Looking through the provided files, most are test files that use the `--collect-only` flag rather than define it. However, there are some relevant files that demonstrate its usage and collection behavior:

```
testing/python/collect.py
function: test_customized_python_discovery
```
This function is relevant as it demonstrates the usage of `--collect-only` flag in a test context and shows how pytest's collection system works.

```
testing/python/collect.py
function: test_dont_collect_non_function_callable
```
This function is relevant as it shows how pytest's collection system determines what should and shouldn't be collected, which is directly related to the `--collect-only` functionality.

For all other files in the provided information:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

Note: While these functions show the usage of `--collect-only`, the actual implementation of the flag and where it would need to be modified to add a short-form alias is not present in the provided files. The change would likely need to be made in pytest's core argument parsing system, which is not shown in these files.
