Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a test changes the working directory using a fixture, the test file path in error messages is shown relative to the new directory ("../test_path_error.py") instead of the original directory ("test_path_error.py").
- This makes it impossible for editors to locate the error since they are unaware of the directory change.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs when a fixture changes the working directory using os.chdir() or monkeypatch.chdir()
- When pytest reports errors, it's using the current working directory to calculate relative paths
- The path calculation doesn't account for directory changes made by fixtures
- This suggests the problem lies in how pytest handles path reporting during test failures

3. Examining Relevant Files:

testing/python/collect.py:
```
Class: TestModule
```
This class contains tests for module collection and path handling, which is relevant to how pytest handles file paths during test execution.

testing/python/fixtures.py:
```
Class: TestRequestBasic
```
This class tests the FixtureRequest functionality, which includes handling test paths and locations. The test_request_getmodulepath method specifically deals with path handling.

The remaining files and classes don't appear directly relevant to the path reporting issue during directory changes. The problem seems to be primarily related to how pytest handles path reporting during test failures and how it interacts with working directory changes in fixtures.

For all other files in the provided information:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue likely requires changes to pytest's core path handling logic to store and use the original working directory when reporting file locations, rather than using the current working directory after it has been changed by a fixture.
