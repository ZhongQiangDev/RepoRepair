Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The current default logging format only shows the base filename without the module name, which makes it harder to identify the source of log messages in larger projects. For example:
```
utils.py                   114 DEBUG    (0.000) SELECT "app_url"."id"...
```
doesn't provide as much context as:
```
DEBUG    django.db.backends:utils.py:114 (0.000) SELECT "app_url"."id"...
```

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the default log format string using `%(filename)` instead of `%(name)` for the logger name. The current format:
```
DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s"
```
only shows the base filename. A more informative format would be:
```
DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s"
```
which includes the full module path.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

src/_pytest/helpconfig.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

src/_pytest/logging.py:
```
function: pytest_addoption
class: LoggingPlugin
```
These are relevant because:
- `pytest_addoption` defines the default logging format options
- `LoggingPlugin` handles the logging configuration and formatting

testing/test_config.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/test_helpconfig.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core of the issue lies in the logging configuration in src/_pytest/logging.py, particularly where the default format string is defined and where the logging configuration is set up. The LoggingPlugin class is responsible for implementing the logging behavior, while pytest_addoption defines the default format options that users can override.
