Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is about confusing assertion rewriting messages when comparing byte strings. When asserting equality between byte strings, the error message shows ASCII ordinal values (like 52 for '4') instead of the actual characters, making the error message harder to understand.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism when handling byte string comparisons. Instead of showing a clear difference between byte strings, it's showing the ASCII ordinal values of the differing bytes, which is not as user-friendly as showing the actual byte string representation.

3. Examining Files:

testing/python/collect.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/python/raises.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

After examining the provided files, I don't see any code directly related to assertion rewriting or byte string comparison handling. The issue would likely be in pytest's assertion rewriting module or comparison utilities, which are not shown in the provided files.

The files provided focus on:
- Test collection mechanisms
- Exception handling and raising
- Package/module discovery
- Test organization

The actual assertion rewriting code that needs to be modified would likely be in files related to pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism, possibly in a module like `_pytest/assertion/` or similar, which is not included in the provided files.
