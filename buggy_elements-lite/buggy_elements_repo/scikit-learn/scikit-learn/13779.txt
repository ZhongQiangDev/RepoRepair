Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The VotingClassifier fails when trying to fit after setting one of its estimators to None. The error occurs because the code attempts to call the fit method on a None object.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue arises because the VotingClassifier doesn't properly handle the case where an estimator is set to None through set_params(). When sample_weights are provided, it tries to call fit on all estimators without first checking if any of them are None.

3. Examining Files:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
class: MetaEstimatorMixin
function: clone
```
These are relevant because:
- BaseEstimator provides the set_params functionality that's involved in the issue
- MetaEstimatorMixin is likely used by VotingClassifier as it's a meta-estimator
- clone function is typically used when handling estimators in meta-estimators

sklearn/exceptions.py:
```
sklearn/exceptions.py
class: NotFittedError
```
This is relevant as it relates to fit method errors, though a different error is being raised in this case.

sklearn/ensemble/voting.py:
This file would contain the VotingClassifier implementation, but it's not provided in the full content.

sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py:
```
sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py
function: if_delegate_has_method
```
This is relevant as it's commonly used in meta-estimators to check for method availability.

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_is_fitted
function: check_array
function: check_X_y
```
These are relevant for input validation and checking fitted estimators, which are related to the fit process where the error occurs.
