Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior Identification:
The AffinityPropagation clustering algorithm is not returning the expected values when it fails to converge. According to the documentation, it should return:
- An empty array as cluster_center_indices
- -1 as label for each training sample
Instead, it returns:
- [2] as cluster_center_indices
- [0,0,0] as labels

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be that the convergence check in AffinityPropagation is not properly connected to the return values. When the algorithm fails to converge (as indicated by reaching max_iter), it should set specific failure values, but instead continues to return the last computed values. This suggests a missing validation step between convergence checking and result generation.

3. File Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
class: ClusterMixin
```
These are relevant because AffinityPropagation inherits from both classes, and they define core behaviors for estimators and clustering algorithms.

sklearn/exceptions.py:
```
sklearn/exceptions.py
class: ConvergenceWarning
```
This is relevant as it's the warning type that should be used when convergence fails.

sklearn/utils/multiclass.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_is_fitted
```
This is relevant as it's used to verify if an estimator has been properly fitted, which relates to the convergence state.

sklearn/cluster/setup.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely needs to be fixed in the AffinityPropagation implementation itself, which isn't shown in the provided files. The above locations are supporting components that would be involved in proper convergence handling and error reporting.
