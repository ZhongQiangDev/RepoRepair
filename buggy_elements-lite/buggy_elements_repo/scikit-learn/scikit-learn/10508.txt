Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The LabelEncoder's transform method behaves inconsistently when handling empty lists depending on the data type used during fitting:
- When fitted with integers [1,2], transforming an empty list works correctly
- When fitted with strings ["a","b"], transforming an empty list fails with a TypeError about dtype casting

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because of inconsistent type handling in the transform method. When transforming an empty list, numpy.searchsorted is trying to cast the empty array to match the dtype of classes_ attribute. For string classes, this causes an invalid casting attempt from float64 to Unicode string.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
```
This is relevant as LabelEncoder inherits from it and it provides core functionality for all estimators.

sklearn/preprocessing/label.py:
```
sklearn/preprocessing/label.py
class: LabelEncoder
```
This is the main class containing the bug in its transform method.

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
function: _assert_all_finite
```
These functions are relevant as they handle array validation and type checking which is part of the transformation process.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The key issue appears to be in LabelEncoder's transform method where it uses numpy.searchsorted without proper type handling for empty arrays. The validation functions in utils/validation.py should be handling the type conversion more carefully when dealing with empty arrays.
