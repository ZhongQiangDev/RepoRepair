Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes are not displaying proper string representations when using `repr()`. Instead of showing their parameters and values, they're showing the default object representation with memory address.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be that these classes are not properly implementing the `__repr__` method to display their parameters. In scikit-learn, estimators typically inherit from `BaseEstimator` which provides a default `__repr__` implementation that shows the class name and its parameters. The problem suggests these classes are either not inheriting correctly from `BaseEstimator` or not properly implementing the parameter handling methods required by `BaseEstimator`.

3. File Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
```
This is relevant because it provides the core `__repr__` functionality that should be used by all estimators. The `BaseEstimator` class contains the implementation for parameter handling and string representation that the KFold classes should be using.

sklearn/multiclass.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/tree/export.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/utils/mocking.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core issue lies in the inheritance and implementation of `BaseEstimator` methods in the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. The `BaseEstimator` class in base.py is the key component as it provides the standard `__repr__` implementation that should be showing the parameters of these classes. The other files don't contain code directly related to the string representation functionality of estimators.
