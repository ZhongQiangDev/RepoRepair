Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The ColumnTransformer fails when using "pandas" output mode and there are transformers with zero features (empty feature lists). The error occurs during the feature name generation process, specifically when trying to set column names for the output DataFrame.

2. Cause Analysis:
- When a transformer has no features, it is not fitted during the pipeline execution
- These unfitted transformers don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` in _column_transformer.py
- This leads to a mismatch between the expected number of columns (3 in the example) and the actual feature names generated (0)
- The error occurs when trying to set these mismatched column names to the output DataFrame

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/pipeline.py:
```
sklearn/pipeline.py
class: Pipeline
class: FeatureUnion
```

sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py:
```
sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py
class: ColumnTransformer
```

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
function: check_X_y
```

The key issue appears to be in the ColumnTransformer class where the feature name generation doesn't properly handle empty feature sets when pandas output is enabled. The Pipeline and FeatureUnion classes are relevant as they are part of the transformation pipeline that uses ColumnTransformer. The validation functions check_array and check_X_y are relevant as they handle input validation and may need to be adjusted to properly handle empty feature sets.
