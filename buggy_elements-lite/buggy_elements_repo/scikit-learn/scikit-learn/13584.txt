Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code tries to print a LogisticRegressionCV instance with Cs=np.array([0.1, 1]), but raises a ValueError about ambiguous truth value of an array. This suggests there's an issue with how the print representation handles numpy arrays in parameters.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error "ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" typically occurs when trying to use a numpy array in a boolean context without explicitly specifying how to evaluate it (using .any() or .all()). This suggests that somewhere in the code that generates the string representation of the estimator, there's a comparison or boolean operation being performed on the numpy array Cs parameter without proper handling.

3. File Analysis:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
```
This is relevant because it contains the `__repr__` method that handles string representation of estimators, which is where the error is likely occurring.

sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py:
```
sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py
class: LogisticRegressionCV
```
This is relevant as it's the class being instantiated and printed, and may have specific parameter handling that affects the representation.

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: _pprint
```
This is relevant because it's used by BaseEstimator.__repr__ to format parameter values for string representation, and likely needs to handle numpy arrays properly.

The error is likely in the chain of BaseEstimator.__repr__ -> _pprint when trying to handle the numpy array parameter. The _pprint function probably needs to be modified to properly handle numpy arrays in parameter values without attempting boolean operations on them.
