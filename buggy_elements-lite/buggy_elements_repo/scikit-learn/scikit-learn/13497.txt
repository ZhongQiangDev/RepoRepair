Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs in `_estimate_mi` function where there's a direct string comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'`. However, discrete_features can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, making this comparison problematic.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The code is using direct string comparison (`==`) with 'auto' against a parameter that could be either a string or an array
- This type of comparison will be deprecated in future versions of numpy as it's not a safe way to compare arrays with scalars
- The code also appears to lack test coverage for cases where discrete_features is not 'auto'

3. File Analysis:

sklearn/preprocessing/imputation.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/utils/multiclass.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
function: _assert_all_finite
function: _is_arraylike
```

The validation.py file contains relevant functions because:
- `check_array` is typically used to validate array inputs and handle different input types
- `_assert_all_finite` helps validate array contents
- `_is_arraylike` helps determine if an input is array-like, which is relevant to the comparison issue

These functions would be important for properly handling the validation and comparison of discrete_features parameter, ensuring type safety and proper array handling. The issue likely needs to be fixed by using these validation functions rather than direct string comparison.

The other files don't contain functions directly related to the array comparison issue or the handling of discrete features parameter.
