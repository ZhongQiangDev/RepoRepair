Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The OneHotEncoder fails when handling unknown string categories with the 'ignore' option. Specifically, when transforming data containing unknown string categories, instead of properly ignoring them, it attempts to replace them with the first category (alphabetically sorted) from the fitted categories. This replacement fails when the first category is longer than the string being replaced, leading to a ValueError.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be unsafe memory handling when dealing with string arrays. When the OneHotEncoder encounters an unknown string category and is set to 'ignore', it tries to replace that string with the first category from the fitted categories. However, if the replacement string is longer than the original string's memory allocation, it causes a buffer overflow or truncation, resulting in the ValueError.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
```
This class is relevant as it provides the base functionality for all estimators, including OneHotEncoder. The issue might be related to how parameters and data are handled at this base level.

```
sklearn/preprocessing/label.py
class: LabelBinarizer
class: LabelEncoder
```
These classes are highly relevant as they handle label encoding and binarization, which are closely related to OneHotEncoder's functionality. The issue might be related to how these classes handle string labels and unknown categories.

```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
function: column_or_1d
```
These functions are relevant as they handle input validation and array conversion, which could be involved in the string array handling issue. The check_array function particularly might need to handle string arrays differently.

The remaining files (sklearn/exceptions.py, sklearn/utils/multiclass.py) contain no relevant functions/classes as they deal with exception handling and multiclass utilities, which are not directly related to the core issue of string category handling in OneHotEncoder.
