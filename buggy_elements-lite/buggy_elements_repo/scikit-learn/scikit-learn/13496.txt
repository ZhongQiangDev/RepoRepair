Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Identify the wrong behavior:
The issue is not actually about wrong behavior, but rather about improving usability. The `warm_start` parameter exists and works in `IsolationForest` through inheritance from `BaseBagging`, but it's not explicitly exposed in the `IsolationForest.__init__()` method, making it less discoverable and harder to use.

2. Analyze the cause:
The cause is that while `IsolationForest` inherits the `warm_start` functionality from `BaseBagging`, it doesn't explicitly declare this parameter in its own initialization method. This makes the parameter "hidden" from users who rely on IDE hints or documentation, even though it's technically available and functional.

3. Examining relevant files:

sklearn/base.py:
```
sklearn/base.py
class: BaseEstimator
```
This class is relevant as it provides the base parameter handling that affects how inherited parameters work.

sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py:
```
sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py
class: BaseBagging
```
This class is highly relevant as it's the source of the `warm_start` parameter that `IsolationForest` inherits.

sklearn/ensemble/base.py:
```
sklearn/ensemble/base.py
class: BaseEnsemble
```
This class is relevant as it's part of the inheritance chain for ensemble methods and affects how parameters are handled.

sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py:
```
sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py
class: IsolationForest
```
This is the main class that needs modification to explicitly expose the `warm_start` parameter.

sklearn/tree/tree.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue revolves around the inheritance chain from BaseEstimator -> BaseEnsemble -> BaseBagging -> IsolationForest, where the warm_start parameter needs to be explicitly exposed in IsolationForest's interface.
