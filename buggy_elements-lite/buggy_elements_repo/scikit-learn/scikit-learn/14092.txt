Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using NCA (NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis) in a GridSearch. The parameter checks in NCA are too strict, causing failures when parameters like 'tol' and 'n_components' are passed with slightly different numeric types than expected.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be overly strict type checking in NCA's parameter validation. Specifically:
- For 'tol': The value 1 is being treated as an int instead of float
- For 'n_components': np.int64 values from np.arange() are not being accepted as valid int types
This is likely due to exact type matching rather than checking for numeric compatibility or performing type conversion.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sklearn/exceptions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/neighbors/nca.py:
Unfortunately this file was not provided in full in the relevant files, but based on the problem description this would contain the NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis class which is central to the issue.

sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sklearn/utils/validation.py:
```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
function: check_array
function: _assert_all_finite
```

The validation.py file contains the most relevant functions since they handle type checking and validation of input arrays and parameters. The check_array function in particular handles dtype validation and conversion, which is directly related to the numeric type issues being encountered. _assert_all_finite is also relevant as it's part of the validation chain that enforces type requirements.

The core issue likely needs to be fixed in the NCA implementation by either:
1. Relaxing the type checking to accept compatible numeric types
2. Adding automatic type conversion for numeric parameters
3. Using the existing validation utilities in a more flexible way
