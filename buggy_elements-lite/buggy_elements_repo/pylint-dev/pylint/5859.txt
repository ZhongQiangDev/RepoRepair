Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that pylint's `--notes` option fails to report fixme warnings (W0511) for note tags that consist entirely of punctuation characters (e.g., "???"). While it correctly reports warnings for regular text tags like "YES", it ignores tags made up of only punctuation marks.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem likely stems from how pylint processes and validates note tags in comments. The issue suggests that the validation logic for note tags may be incorrectly filtering out or failing to recognize tags that consist entirely of punctuation characters. This would be handled in the code that processes comment tokens and checks them against the configured note tags.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

pylint/checkers/misc.py:
```
pylint/checkers/misc.py
class: EncodingChecker
```
This class is directly relevant as it handles the processing of warning notes (FIXME, XXX, TODO, etc.) in the code. It contains the logic for detecting and reporting these notes, including the problematic handling of punctuation-only tags.

pylint/checkers/utils.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

pylint/lint/run.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue appears to be primarily in the EncodingChecker class, which is responsible for processing and reporting note tags. The problem likely lies in how this class processes the notes and matches them against the configured patterns. The class probably needs to be modified to properly handle punctuation-only tags in its pattern matching or validation logic.
