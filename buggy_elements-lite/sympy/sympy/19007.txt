Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code attempts to access element C[i,0] from a BlockMatrix C that consists of two blocks: A (1x1) and B (nx1). The output incorrectly returns (A)[i,0], which assumes the element is always from matrix A, when in reality the element could be from either A or B depending on the value of i.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how BlockMatrix handles element access (_entry method) when dealing with stacked matrices. The system is not properly determining which block contains the requested element based on the index i. Instead, it's defaulting to the first block (A) regardless of the index value.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
class: BlockMatrix
```
This is the main class responsible for handling block matrices and their operations, including element access. The issue likely stems from its implementation of element access.

sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: MatrixElement
class: MatrixExpr
```
These classes are relevant as they provide the base functionality for matrix expressions and element access that BlockMatrix builds upon.

sympy/matrices/expressions/slice.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/slice.py
class: MatrixSlice
```
This class is relevant as it handles matrix slicing operations which are related to how elements are accessed within block matrices.

The core issue appears to be in the BlockMatrix class's element access logic, which needs to properly calculate which block contains the requested element based on the cumulative sizes of the blocks and the provided index.

The other files in the provided information do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to this specific element access issue.
