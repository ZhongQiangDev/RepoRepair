Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue shows inconsistent behavior between SymPy v1.5.1 and v1.6.2 when using sympify with ceiling function:
- In v1.5.1, both evaluate=True and evaluate=False give the same result: `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)`
- In v1.6.2, evaluate=False gives `4*ceiling(x/4) - 3` while evaluate=True gives `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)`

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how the ceiling function is evaluated during sympification. When evaluate=False in v1.6.2, the expression is being simplified incorrectly by distributing the coefficient 4 into the ceiling function's argument, which shouldn't happen. This suggests a problem in either the sympification process or the ceiling function's evaluation logic.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
```

sympy/core/evalf.py:
```
sympy/core/evalf.py
function: evalf_ceiling
function: get_integer_part
```

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```

sympy/core/sympify.py:
```
sympy/core/sympify.py
function: sympify
function: _sympify
```

sympy/core/symbol.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between sympify and the ceiling function's evaluation. The Basic class provides core functionality, while Expr handles expression manipulation. The evalf_ceiling and get_integer_part functions are directly involved in ceiling function evaluation. The sympify and _sympify functions control how expressions are converted and evaluated during the sympification process.
