Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when setting a position vector between two points using `Q.set_pos(P, r)`, calling `Q.vel(A)` to get the velocity fails with a ValueError, even though the velocity should be calculable from the position vector's time derivative.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that while the Point class has the position information set through `set_pos()`, it doesn't automatically calculate and set the corresponding velocity in the velocity dictionary (`_vel_dict`). This is in contrast to how ReferenceFrame handles angular velocities, where setting orientation automatically allows calculation of angular velocities.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/physics/mechanics/functions.py:

sympy/physics/mechanics/particle.py:
```

sympy/physics/vector/frame.py:
```
sympy/physics/vector/frame.py
class: ReferenceFrame
```

sympy/physics/vector/point.py:
```
sympy/physics/vector/point.py
class: Point
```

sympy/physics/vector/vector.py:
```
sympy/physics/vector/vector.py
class: Vector
```

The key classes involved are:
- Point class: This is where the main issue lies, as it needs to be modified to automatically calculate velocities from position information
- ReferenceFrame class: Provides the reference implementation of how automatic calculations work for angular velocities
- Vector class: Supports the underlying vector operations needed for velocity calculations

The fix would likely involve modifying the Point class to automatically calculate and store velocities in its `_vel_dict` when positions are set, similar to how ReferenceFrame handles angular velocities.
