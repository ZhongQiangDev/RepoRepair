Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to evaluate a Point2D expression with `evaluate(False)`. While the expression works normally without `evaluate(False)` or when using `evaluate=False` directly in `S()`, it crashes with an "Imaginary coordinates are not permitted" error when used with the context manager `with evaluate(False)`.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that during the evaluation process with `evaluate(False)`, the system is incorrectly interpreting the coordinates as imaginary numbers. This likely happens because the evaluation context is not being properly propagated through the parsing and evaluation chain, causing the Point2D constructor to receive malformed coordinate values that it interprets as imaginary numbers.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/evalf.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```

sympy/core/sympify.py:
```
sympy/core/sympify.py
function: sympify
function: _sympify
```

sympy/geometry/point.py:
```
sympy/geometry/point.py
class: Point
class: Point2D
```

The issue appears to be in the interaction between sympify's evaluation handling and Point2D's coordinate processing. The `sympify` function is responsible for converting string expressions into SymPy objects, while respecting the evaluation context. The `Point` and `Point2D` classes handle the actual point creation and coordinate validation.

The `Expr` class is relevant as it provides the base evaluation behavior that all SymPy expressions inherit. The error likely stems from how the evaluation flag is handled during the expression parsing and object construction chain through these components.
