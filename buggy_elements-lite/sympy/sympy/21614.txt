Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem shows that when creating a Derivative of a MatrixSymbol, its `kind` attribute returns `UndefinedKind`, while for an Integral of the same MatrixSymbol, the `kind` attribute correctly returns `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how the `kind` attribute is handled in Derivative objects when dealing with matrix expressions. While the Integral class correctly propagates the matrix kind information, the Derivative class seems to be missing proper handling of matrix kinds, resulting in an undefined kind.

3. File Analysis:

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
class Basic
```
This is relevant as it's the base class that likely implements the fundamental `kind` attribute handling.

sympy/core/function.py:
```
sympy/core/function.py
class: Derivative
class: Function
```
These are relevant as Derivative is the main class involved in the issue, and Function is its parent class that might affect kind handling.

sympy/core/kind.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/matrices/matrices.py:
```
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
class: MatrixBase
```
This is relevant as it's a base class for matrices and might influence how matrix kinds are handled.

sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: MatrixExpr
class: MatrixSymbol
```
These are relevant as they define the matrix expression behavior and MatrixSymbol is directly used in the example showing the issue.

The issue likely stems from either missing kind propagation logic in the Derivative class or incorrect interaction between Derivative and MatrixSymbol classes when handling kinds. The fix would likely involve adding proper kind handling in the Derivative class similar to how Integral handles it.
