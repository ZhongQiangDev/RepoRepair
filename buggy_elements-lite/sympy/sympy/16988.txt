Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Intersection operation is not handling duplicates correctly. When given {1},{1},{x}, it returns EmptySet() when it should return Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True)). Similarly, when given {1},{x}, it returns {1} without considering the condition on x.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the Intersection class handles duplicate sets and conditions. When processing {1},{1},{x}, it's treating them as distinct sets and returning an empty set because x is not equal to 1. However, it should recognize that {1} appears twice and handle the conditional case with x appropriately using Piecewise.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/logic/boolalg.py:
```
sympy/logic/boolalg.py
class: And
class: Boolean
class: BooleanFunction
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the logical operations and conditions that should be used in the intersection evaluation.

sympy/sets/sets.py:
```
sympy/sets/sets.py
class: Intersection
class: FiniteSet
class: Set
```
These classes are directly involved in the set operations and intersection behavior.

sympy/sets/conditionset.py:
```
sympy/sets/conditionset.py
class: ConditionSet
```
This class is relevant as it handles sets defined by conditions, which is needed for the correct Piecewise result.

sympy/sets/contains.py:
```
sympy/sets/contains.py
class: Contains
```
This class is relevant as it's used to check set membership and conditions.

The remaining files do not contain directly relevant functions/classes for this specific issue:
- sympy/sets/fancysets.py: This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
