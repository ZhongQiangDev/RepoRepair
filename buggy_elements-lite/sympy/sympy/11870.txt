Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that SymPy is not automatically simplifying exponential expressions involving i (imaginary unit) into their equivalent trigonometric forms. Specifically:
- `1/2 * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` should simplify to `sin(k)`
- `1/2/k * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` should simplify to `sinc(k)`

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from SymPy's trigonometric simplification system not automatically recognizing and applying Euler's formula for converting between exponential and trigonometric forms. The formula states that:
- `exp(ix) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)`
- Therefore, `sin(x) = -i/2 * (exp(ix) - exp(-ix))`
- And `sinc(x) = sin(x)/x`

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
class: sin
class: sinc
class: TrigonometricFunction
```

sympy/simplify/fu.py:
```
sympy/simplify/fu.py
function: exptrigsimp
function: TR2i
function: TR10i
```

sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py:
```
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
function: trigsimp
function: _trigsimp
function: __trigsimp
```

sympy/series/fourier.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/simplify/hyperexpand.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue primarily involves the trigonometric simplification functions and the sin/sinc classes. The exptrigsimp function in fu.py would be particularly relevant as it's designed to handle conversions between exponential and trigonometric forms. The trigsimp function and its helpers in trigsimp.py are also key since they handle general trigonometric simplifications. The sin and sinc classes define the behavior of these functions, while TrigonometricFunction provides the base functionality for all trig functions.
