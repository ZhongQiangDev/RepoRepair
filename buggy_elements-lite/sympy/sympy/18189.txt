Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The diophantine function produces different results for the same equation when the order of symbols (variables) is changed in the `syms` parameter, even though `permute=True` is specified. This indicates an inconsistency in handling variable permutations.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the diophantine solver handles variable permutations. When `permute=True`, it should produce the same set of solutions regardless of the variable order, but it's failing to do so. This suggests there might be an issue in:
- How variables are ordered/sorted before solving
- How permutations are generated and handled
- How solutions are combined when permutations are involved

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/solvers/diophantine.py:

function: diophantine
function: _diop_linear
function: merge_solution
function: _sorted_tuple
```

sympy/utilities/iterables.py:
```
sympy/utilities/iterables.py
function: permutations
function: variations
function: uniq
```

The issue likely stems from the interaction between the diophantine solver functions and the permutation handling utilities. The diophantine function is the main entry point where the variable order is processed, _diop_linear handles the actual equation solving, merge_solution combines partial solutions, and _sorted_tuple helps with solution ordering. The permutations and variations functions from iterables.py are likely used to generate the variable permutations, while uniq ensures unique solutions are returned.

The bug might be in how these functions interact to handle variable permutations and combine solutions, particularly in the diophantine or merge_solution functions where the variable order might not be properly normalized or solutions might not be properly combined across all permutations.
