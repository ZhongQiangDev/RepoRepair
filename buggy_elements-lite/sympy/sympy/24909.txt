Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when multiplying `milli` (a prefix representing 10^-3) with a unit like `W` (Watts), the result evaluates to 1 instead of creating a unit with the milli prefix (milliwatts/mW). This is incorrect because prefixes should modify units to create new scaled units.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in how prefix multiplication with units is handled. When `milli*W` is evaluated, it's returning 1 instead of properly combining the prefix with the unit to create a scaled unit. This suggests an issue in either:
- The multiplication operation handling between prefixes and units
- The way prefixes are defined or processed
- The evaluation logic for prefix-unit combinations

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

```
sympy/core/mul.py
class: Mul
```
This class is relevant as it handles multiplication operations in SymPy, including how different types multiply together. The issue might be in how it handles multiplication between prefix objects and units.

```
sympy/core/numbers.py
class: One
class: Number
```
These classes are relevant because the incorrect behavior results in returning 1 (One), suggesting the multiplication operation is somehow reducing to a Number/One instance instead of maintaining the prefix-unit relationship.

```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This class is relevant as it's the base class for expressions in SymPy and might affect how prefix-unit combinations are evaluated.

```
sympy/core/basic.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The remaining files don't appear to contain directly relevant code to this specific issue, as they deal with more general numeric operations or specific number types that aren't directly involved in prefix-unit multiplication behavior.

The core of the issue likely lies in how the Mul class handles the multiplication between prefix and unit objects, possibly defaulting to numeric evaluation (resulting in 1) instead of maintaining the symbolic relationship between the prefix and unit.
