Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves an unexpected `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` on expressions containing hyperbolic functions (sinh/cosh/tanh) with piecewise arguments. The error only occurs under specific conditions:
- When symbols are declared with real=True
- When the expression includes division by a variable
- When wrapped in certain unary functions like exp, sin, log
- Only happens with hyperbolic functions

2. Cause Analysis:
The error appears to be related to assumptions handling and caching. The fact that:
- It only happens with real assumptions
- It works after running again without clearing cache
- It's specific to certain function combinations
suggests there's an issue with how assumptions are being processed and cached during the substitution process, particularly when dealing with piecewise expressions inside hyperbolic functions.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

sympy/core/assumptions.py:
```
sympy/core/assumptions.py
class: ManagedProperties
class: StdFactKB
function: _ask
```
This file is relevant as it handles assumptions processing and caching, which appears central to the issue since the error only occurs with real=True assumptions.

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
function: _aresame
```
This file is relevant as it contains the core substitution logic and expression comparison functionality used during subs() operations.

sympy/core/cache.py:
```
sympy/core/cache.py
function: clear_cache
```
This file is relevant as the issue manifests differently based on cache state.

sympy/core/symbol.py:
```
sympy/core/symbol.py
class: Symbol
```
This file is relevant as the issue involves symbol assumptions and their handling.

sympy/core/sympify.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue appears to be primarily in the interaction between assumptions handling, caching, and the core substitution logic, particularly when dealing with piecewise expressions inside hyperbolic functions. The error likely stems from how assumptions are being processed and cached during the substitution process.
