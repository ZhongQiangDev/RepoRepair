Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when trying to calculate the sum of all elements in an identity matrix. While the code correctly identifies that M.T * M is an identity matrix and correctly calculates the sum of diagonal elements as 'n', it incorrectly returns 0 when summing all elements of the matrix.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how SymPy handles the summation of elements in an identity matrix. When using nested Sum operations to sum all elements, the system seems to be failing to properly recognize that an identity matrix has exactly n ones on its diagonal and zeros elsewhere, which should sum to n. Instead, it's evaluating to 0, suggesting a problem in either the matrix element evaluation or the summation logic.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes:

sympy/assumptions/handlers/matrices.py:
```
sympy/assumptions/handlers/matrices.py
class: AskDiagonalHandler
class: AskIntegerElementsHandler
```

sympy/concrete/summations.py:
```
sympy/concrete/summations.py
function: eval_sum
function: eval_sum_symbolic
class: Sum
```

sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: Identity
class: MatrixElement
```

sympy/matrices/dense.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between the summation evaluation (in Sum class and eval_sum functions) and how matrix elements are handled for identity matrices (Identity class). The AskDiagonalHandler and AskIntegerElementsHandler are relevant as they determine how the system recognizes and handles properties of the identity matrix during evaluation.

The problem could be in how the nested summation is evaluated when dealing with matrix elements from an identity matrix, where the element handlers may not be properly communicating the matrix's properties to the summation evaluator.
