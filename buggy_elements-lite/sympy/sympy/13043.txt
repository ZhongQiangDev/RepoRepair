Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `decompose()` function in intpoly returns a list of arbitrary order when `separate=True` is used. This arbitrary ordering is causing test failures after some core changes.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from using `list(poly_dict.values())` which returns values from a dictionary in an arbitrary order. Since dictionaries in Python are unordered by default, converting their values directly to a list can result in inconsistent ordering across different runs or Python versions. This becomes problematic when tests expect results in a specific order.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

sympy/polys/constructor.py:
```
sympy/polys/constructor.py
function: construct_domain
```
This function is relevant as it handles the construction of polynomial domains and could be involved in how polynomials are processed before decomposition.

sympy/polys/densebasic.py:
```
sympy/polys/densebasic.py
function: dmp_from_dict
function: dmp_to_dict
```
These functions are relevant as they handle conversion between dictionary and dense polynomial representations, which is directly related to the ordering issue.

sympy/polys/polytools.py:
```
sympy/polys/polytools.py
function: decompose
class: Poly
```
These are relevant as they are likely the high-level interfaces that use the dictionary-to-list conversion causing the ordering issue.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely originates in the interaction between these components, where dictionary values are converted to lists without maintaining a consistent ordering. The fix would need to ensure a deterministic ordering when converting from dictionary representation to list form.
