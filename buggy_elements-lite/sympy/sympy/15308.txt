Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The LaTeX output for `trace(A**2)` shows as 'Trace(A**2)'
- Two issues:
  a) 'Trace' is not properly converted to LaTeX format (should be '\mathrm{Tr}' or similar)
  b) The inner expression A**2 is not properly converted to LaTeX format (should be A^2)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The LaTeX printer is not properly handling the Trace class
- There seems to be no specific LaTeX printing method for the Trace class
- The printer is not recursively applying LaTeX formatting to inner expressions
- The fallback mechanism for LaTeX printing is not working as expected

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py
class: Trace
```
This class needs a LaTeX printing method to properly format trace expressions.

```
sympy/printing/latex.py
class: LatexPrinter
```
This class needs to implement proper handling for Trace objects and ensure recursive LaTeX formatting of inner expressions.

```
sympy/printing/defaults.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/printing/str.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The main fix would need to be implemented in the LatexPrinter class to properly handle Trace objects, and possibly in the Trace class itself to provide a _latex method for custom LaTeX formatting.
