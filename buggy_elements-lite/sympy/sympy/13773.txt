Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The matrix multiplication operator @ (__matmul__) is incorrectly allowing scalar operands to be used in matrix multiplication. Specifically, it's allowing expressions like `2@B` where `2` is a scalar and `B` is a matrix, which should not be allowed according to matrix multiplication rules.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem description mentions that `__matmul__` is currently just copying `__mul__`, which means it's inheriting the behavior of regular multiplication. However, matrix multiplication (@) should be more restrictive than regular multiplication (*). It should only work between matrices or between a matrix and a vector, but not between a scalar and a matrix.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/matrices/common.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
sympy/matrices/dense.py
class: DenseMatrix
```
The DenseMatrix class is relevant as it would need to implement proper matrix multiplication behavior.

```
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
class: MatrixBase
```
The MatrixBase class is relevant as it's the base class that would define the fundamental matrix operations including __matmul__.

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
class: MatMul
function: validate
```
The MatMul class and validate function are relevant as they handle matrix multiplication operations and validation of matrix shapes.

The issue likely needs to be fixed by implementing proper validation in the __matmul__ method of either DenseMatrix or MatrixBase class, ensuring it follows the same restrictions as NumPy's implementation where scalar operands are not allowed in matrix multiplication operations.
