Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code displays vector unit symbols (i_C, k_C) in incorrect positions within the output expressions. Specifically, the unit vectors appear to be inserted in the middle of other terms, breaking the natural flow and readability of the mathematical expressions.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how vector expressions are pretty-printed in the terminal. The problem likely stems from the interaction between SymPy's vector printing system and its general pretty printing functionality. The unit vectors (i_C, k_C) are being treated as separate terms and not properly grouped with their coefficients in the pretty printing process.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/interactive/printing.py
function: init_printing
```
This is relevant as it's the primary function that sets up the printing system and is explicitly called in the problem code.

```
sympy/physics/vector/printing.py
class: VectorPrettyPrinter
class: VectorLatexPrinter
function: vpprint
```
These are directly relevant as they handle the specialized printing of vector expressions, which is where the formatting issue occurs.

```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
class: PrettyPrinter
function: pretty_print
```
These are relevant as they handle the core pretty printing functionality that's being customized for vector printing.

For the remaining files:
```
sympy/interactive/session.py
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

```
sympy/printing/str.py
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely needs to be addressed in the VectorPrettyPrinter class's implementation, particularly in how it handles the formatting of vector terms and unit vectors. The interaction between the general pretty printing system and the vector-specific printing system appears to be causing the misplacement of unit vector symbols in the output.
