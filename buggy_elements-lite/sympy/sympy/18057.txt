Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior Identification:
The issue occurs when SymPy attempts to compare a Symbol with an object whose __repr__ method returns a string that could be evaluated as a Python expression. Instead of doing a direct comparison, SymPy tries to evaluate the __repr__ string, which can lead to:
- Unexpected attribute access errors (e.g., when __repr__ returns "x.y")
- Incorrect equality results (e.g., when __repr__ returns "x")

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in SymPy's equality comparison logic where it:
1. Takes an unknown object and attempts to sympify it for comparison
2. During sympification, it evaluates the object's __repr__ string as Python code
3. This is dangerous as it executes arbitrary code from __repr__ strings
4. The correct behavior should be to treat the __repr__ string as a literal string rather than executable code

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
```
This class is relevant as it's the base class that defines core comparison behavior.

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This class is relevant as it inherits from Basic and implements __eq__ method that triggers the sympification.

sympy/core/symbol.py:
```
sympy/core/symbol.py
class: Symbol
```
This class is relevant as it's directly involved in the problematic comparison.

sympy/core/sympify.py:
```
sympy/core/sympify.py
function: sympify
```
This function is directly relevant as it's responsible for the unsafe evaluation of __repr__ strings.

sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py:
```
sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py
function: parse_expr
function: eval_expr
```
These functions are relevant as they're part of the evaluation chain that processes the string representation unsafely.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.
