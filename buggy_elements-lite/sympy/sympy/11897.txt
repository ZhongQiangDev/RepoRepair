Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior Identification:
The problem shows two inconsistencies between LaTeX printer and pretty printer:
a) For exp(-x)*log(x):
   - LaTeX: \frac{1}{e^{x}} \log{(x)}
   - Pretty: ℯ^(-x)⋅log(x)

b) For 1/(x + y)/2:
   - LaTeX: \frac{1}{2x + 2y}
   - Pretty: 1/(2⋅(x + y))

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue appears to be in how fractions and exponentials are handled differently between the LaTeX and pretty printers:
- The LaTeX printer is converting exp(-x) to \frac{1}{e^{x}} while pretty printer keeps it as ℯ^(-x)
- For fractions, LaTeX printer is combining the denominators while pretty printer maintains the original structure
- The inconsistency suggests different rules for expression transformation between the two printers

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

sympy/printing/defaults.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/printing/latex.py:
```
sympy/printing/latex.py
class: LatexPrinter
```

sympy/printing/printer.py:
```
sympy/printing/printer.py
class: Printer
```

sympy/printing/str.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
class: PrettyPrinter
```

The issue primarily involves the LatexPrinter and PrettyPrinter classes, as they handle the core printing logic for their respective formats. The base Printer class is also relevant as it defines the fundamental printing behavior that both inherit from. The inconsistency stems from how these classes implement their printing methods differently for fractions and exponentials.
