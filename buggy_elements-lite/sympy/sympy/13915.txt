Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when substituting b with a in the expression r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b)). The substitution r.subs(b,a) returns 1, but this is incorrect because when b=a, both the numerator and denominator contain terms that become undefined (division by zero).

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem arises because the substitution operation is not properly handling the case where the substitution leads to an undefined expression (division by zero). When b=a:
- 1/(a+a) and 1/(a-a) both appear in the expression
- 1/(a-a) is undefined (division by zero)
- The entire expression should be undefined, not 1

3. Relevant Functions/Classes by File:

sympy/core/add.py:
```
sympy/core/add.py
class: Add
```

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
function: _aresame
```

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```

sympy/core/sympify.py:
```
sympy/core/sympify.py
function: sympify
```

The remaining files (sympy/simplify/radsimp.py) contain no relevant functions/classes.

The issue primarily involves the substitution mechanism and how undefined expressions are handled. The Basic class provides the core substitution functionality, while Add and Expr classes handle the expression manipulation. The _aresame function is relevant for comparing expressions during substitution, and sympify is involved in processing the substitution values.

The problem likely stems from the substitution logic in these classes not properly propagating undefined states when a subexpression becomes undefined. When b is replaced with a, the system should detect that this creates an undefined expression in the denominator and propagate this undefined state to the entire expression.
