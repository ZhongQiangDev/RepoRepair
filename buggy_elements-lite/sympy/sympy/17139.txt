Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails when trying to simplify cos(x)**I with a TypeError stating "Invalid comparison of complex I". This occurs when trying to compare expressions involving the imaginary unit I.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the code attempts to compare expressions containing the imaginary unit I using < operator, which is not valid for complex numbers. Specifically, the error trace shows this happens in fu.py when checking `(rv.exp < 0) == True` during trigonometric simplification.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
sympy/simplify/fu.py
function: TR6
function: _TR56
```
These functions are directly involved in the error as shown in the traceback. TR6 calls _TR56 which attempts to compare complex exponents.

```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This class contains the __lt__ method that raises the TypeError when attempting to compare complex numbers.

```
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
class: im
class: re
```
These classes are relevant as they handle complex number components and could be used to properly handle complex comparisons.

```
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
function: futrig
function: _futrig
```
These functions are part of the trigonometric simplification chain that leads to the error condition.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue appears to be in the fu.py file where TR6 and _TR56 functions need to be modified to properly handle complex exponents without attempting direct comparison.
