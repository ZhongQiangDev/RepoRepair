Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The LaTeX string produced for matrix multiplication indexing `(M*N)[i, j]` contains invalid LaTeX syntax with double subscripts `_i_1`, which makes it uncompilable and won't render in MathJax.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the matrix multiplication indexing is translated to LaTeX. When generating the LaTeX for the indexed matrix multiplication, the printer is incorrectly handling the summation index variable by adding multiple underscore characters (`_`), resulting in invalid LaTeX syntax. The correct LaTeX should have proper subscript formatting for the summation index.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
class: MatrixElement
class: MatrixExpr
```
These classes are relevant as they handle matrix element access and matrix expressions, which are core to the indexing operation.

sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
class: MatMul
```
This class is relevant as it handles matrix multiplication and its _entry method would be involved in generating the indexed expression.

sympy/printing/latex.py:
```
sympy/printing/latex.py
class: LatexPrinter
```
This class is directly relevant as it's responsible for converting the matrix expressions to LaTeX format, where the incorrect subscript formatting is occurring.

sympy/printing/str.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/tensor/indexed.py:
```
sympy/tensor/indexed.py
class: Indexed
class: IndexedBase
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the indexing operations that are part of the matrix element access.
