Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when evaluating `coth(log(tan(x)))` with certain integral values (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18). The code raises a NameError indicating 'cotm' is not defined in the eval method of the hyperbolic.py file.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that in the evaluation of the hyperbolic cotangent function (coth), there's a reference to a variable 'cotm' that hasn't been defined. This likely occurs during the evaluation chain:
- First, tan(x) is evaluated for the integral value
- Then log(tan(x)) is computed
- Finally, coth attempts to evaluate this result
The error occurs in the coth evaluation step, specifically in its eval method, suggesting a missing variable assignment or incorrect variable reference.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/numbers.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py
class: exp
```

sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py
class: coth
class: HyperbolicFunction
```

sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
class: tan
class: TrigonometricFunction
```

The most relevant locations are in hyperbolic.py where the coth class is defined, as this is where the error originates. The tan and exp classes are also relevant as they're part of the evaluation chain. The error specifically occurs in coth's eval method where it tries to use an undefined variable 'cotm'.

The other files, while containing related mathematical functions, don't contain code directly related to this specific error.
