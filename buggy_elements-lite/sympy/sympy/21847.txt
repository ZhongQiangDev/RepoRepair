Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `itermonomials` function is not returning all monomials with total degree equal to min_degrees. For example, when min_degrees=3 and max_degrees=3, it only returns monomials with individual variable degrees of 3 (like x1³, x2³, x3³) but misses mixed terms with total degree 3 (like x1x2², x2x3², etc.).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the monomial generation logic where the function is incorrectly filtering monomials based on min_degrees. It's only keeping monomials where a single variable has degree equal to min_degrees, instead of keeping all monomials whose total degree equals min_degrees.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/polys/monomials.py:
```
sympy/polys/monomials.py
function: itermonomials
function: monomial_deg
```
This file contains the core functions involved in the issue. `itermonomials` is the function with the bug, and `monomial_deg` is used to calculate the total degree of monomials, which is crucial for the min_degrees filtering.

sympy/polys/orderings.py:
```
sympy/polys/orderings.py
class: GradedLexOrder
```
This class is relevant as it handles the ordering of monomials based on their total degree, which is directly related to how monomials should be filtered by min_degrees.

sympy/polys/polytools.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue is primarily in the monomial generation and degree calculation logic in monomials.py, with some potential interaction with the monomial ordering system in orderings.py. The core fix would need to be in the `itermonomials` function to properly handle the min_degrees parameter by correctly filtering based on total degree rather than individual variable degrees.
