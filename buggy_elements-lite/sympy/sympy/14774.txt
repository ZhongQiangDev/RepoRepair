Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The LaTeX printer does not properly handle the full names of inverse trigonometric functions for `acsc` and `asec`. When using `inv_trig_style="full"`, it should output `\arccsc` and `\arcsec`, but instead outputs `\operatorname{acsc}` and `\operatorname{asec}`.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the incomplete list of inverse trigonometric functions in the `inv_trig_table` within the LaTeX printer. The table only includes "asin", "acos", "atan", "acot" but misses "acsc" and "asec". This causes the printer to fall back to using `\operatorname` instead of the proper `\arc` prefix for these functions.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
class: acsc
class: asec
```
These classes are relevant as they define the inverse trigonometric functions that are not being properly formatted.

sympy/printing/latex.py:
```
sympy/printing/latex.py
class: LatexPrinter
```
This class is directly relevant as it contains the `inv_trig_table` that needs to be modified to include the missing inverse trigonometric functions.

sympy/printing/str.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core issue lies in the LatexPrinter class's implementation, where the `inv_trig_table` needs to be updated to include "acsc" and "asec" to ensure proper LaTeX formatting when `inv_trig_style="full"` is specified.
