Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that the `sign` function in SymPy cannot be rewritten in terms of `Abs` (absolute value) function, even though mathematically `sign(z) = z/Abs(z)` for non-zero complex numbers. Additionally, there's an inconsistency in handling zero values - `sign(0)` returns 0 while `0/Abs(0)` returns NaN.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the `sign` class in SymPy lacks a proper `_eval_rewrite` method to handle rewriting in terms of `Abs`. Additionally, the special case of zero needs to be handled consistently between `sign` and the mathematical definition using `Abs`.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/core/basic.py:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
class: Basic
```
This class is relevant as it provides the base rewrite functionality that needs to be extended for the sign function.

sympy/core/expr.py:
```
sympy/core/expr.py
class: Expr
```
This class is relevant as it inherits from Basic and provides expression manipulation capabilities needed for rewriting functions.

sympy/core/numbers.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
class: sign
class: Abs
```
These classes are directly relevant as they are the core components involved in the rewriting functionality that needs to be implemented.

sympy/simplify/simplify.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The main changes would need to be made in the `sign` class to implement proper rewriting in terms of `Abs`, and to ensure consistent handling of zero values between both functions.
