Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The trigsimp function incorrectly simplifies cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2) as though it were cos(x)+sin(x) for complex x, even though these expressions are not equivalent for complex values. However, it correctly handles real x.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the handling of sqrt(sin(x)**2) when x is complex. For real x, sqrt(sin(x)**2) equals |sin(x)|, but for complex x, this equality doesn't hold. The simplification algorithm seems to be incorrectly assuming that sqrt(sin(x)**2) = sin(x) in all cases, which is only true when sin(x) is non-negative real.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
class: Abs
classL: sign
```
These are relevant because they handle absolute value and sign operations which are crucial for correctly processing sqrt(sin(x)**2).

sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
class: sin
class: cos
```
These are fundamental to the problem as they define the behavior of sine and cosine functions.

sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py:
```
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
function: trigsimp
function: _trigsimp
function: __trigsimp
```
These functions are directly responsible for the simplification of trigonometric expressions and likely contain the bug.

sympy/simplify/fu.py:
```
sympy/simplify/fu.py
function: fu
function: TR1
```
These functions are involved in trigonometric simplification and transformation rules.

sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py:
```
sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py
function: sqrtdenest
```
This is relevant as it handles the denesting of square roots, which is part of the problematic expression sqrt(sin(x)**2).

The core issue likely lies in the interaction between trigsimp and the handling of complex absolute values in the Abs class, where the simplification algorithm is not properly considering the complex case when simplifying expressions involving sqrt(sin(x)**2).
