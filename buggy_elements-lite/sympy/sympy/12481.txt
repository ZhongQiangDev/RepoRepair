Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The constructor `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a ValueError when it should instead construct the identity permutation. The problem occurs when trying to create a permutation from non-disjoint cycles.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the handling of non-disjoint cycles during permutation construction. When cycles share elements (are non-disjoint), they should be applied in left-to-right order to produce the resulting permutation. Instead, the code is raising an error when detecting non-disjoint cycles.

3. Examining Files:

sympy/combinatorics/generators.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py:
```
sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py
class: Permutation
class: Cycle
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle permutation construction and cycle operations. The Permutation class is where the constructor error occurs, and the Cycle class handles cycle representations.

sympy/combinatorics/util.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue is most likely in the Permutation class constructor or cycle handling methods, and potentially in the Cycle class implementation. The error occurs when trying to construct a Permutation from non-disjoint cycles, so these two classes would be responsible for handling this case correctly.

The core of the fix would need to:
1. Modify how the Permutation constructor handles cycles
2. Update the cycle composition logic in either the Permutation or Cycle class to properly handle non-disjoint cycles
3. Ensure cycles are applied in the correct order (left-to-right) when constructing the permutation
