Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is with vertical alignment in the pretty printing of a summation expression. Specifically, when printing `Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3`, the `x` term and the `+ 3` term are not properly aligned vertically. The `x` appears higher than the `+ 3` in the output.

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be a vertical alignment issue in the pretty printing system, specifically related to how summation expressions are formatted when combined with additional terms. The baseline for the summation's main term (`x`) and the additional term (`+ 3`) are not being properly aligned during the construction of the pretty-printed output.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

sympy/concrete/summations.py:
```
sympy/concrete/summations.py
class: Sum
```
This class is relevant as it defines the basic structure of summation expressions.

sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
class: PrettyPrinter
```
This class is directly responsible for converting mathematical expressions into pretty-printed format, including summations.

sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py
class: prettyForm
class: stringPict
```
These classes handle the actual construction and alignment of ASCII art representations, including vertical alignment of mathematical expressions.

sympy/printing/printer.py:
```
sympy/printing/printer.py
class: Printer
```
This is the base printer class that defines core printing functionality.

sympy/core/add.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue likely needs to be addressed in either the PrettyPrinter class's handling of summations or in the stringPict/prettyForm classes' vertical alignment logic.
