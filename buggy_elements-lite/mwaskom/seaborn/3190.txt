Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails when trying to create a plot using boolean data for color mapping. The error occurs during scale setup, specifically when trying to perform subtraction on boolean values.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the scale system is trying to perform numeric operations (subtraction) on boolean values during normalization. This suggests that the scale system isn't properly handling boolean data types when setting up color scales. The error message specifically mentions that boolean subtraction is not supported.

3. File Analysis:

seaborn/utils.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

seaborn/_core/plot.py:
```
seaborn/_core/plot.py
class: Plot
class: Plotter
```
These classes are relevant because they handle the initial plot setup and scale configuration where the error occurs. The error traceback shows the failure happening in Plot._plot and Plotter._setup_scales.

seaborn/_core/scales.py:
```
seaborn/_core/scales.py
class: ContinuousBase
class: Scale
class: ScaleSpec
```
These classes are highly relevant as they handle scale transformations and normalization. The error occurs during scale setup and normalization operations, which are managed by these classes. The ContinuousBase class specifically handles the normalization that's failing with boolean data.

The issue appears to be primarily in the scale handling system, where boolean data is being treated as continuous numeric data without proper type checking or conversion. The fix would likely involve either:
1. Converting boolean data to numeric values before scale operations
2. Implementing special handling for boolean data in the scale system
3. Adding type checking to prevent boolean data from being processed as continuous data
