Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when specifying a verbose_name for an Inline class in Django admin, the verbose_name_plural is not automatically derived from the verbose_name. Instead, it continues using the model's name or the model's Meta class verbose_name. This creates inconsistency with Django's standard behavior where verbose_name_plural is typically derived from verbose_name.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how the InlineModelAdmin class handles verbose names. When initializing an inline admin instance, it should follow Django's standard pattern of deriving verbose_name_plural from verbose_name if verbose_name_plural is not explicitly specified, but it's not doing this.

3. Examining Files:

django/contrib/admin/checks.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/checks.py
class: InlineModelAdminChecks
```
This class is relevant as it performs validation checks on InlineModelAdmin configurations, including verbose name settings.

django/contrib/admin/helpers.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/contrib/admin/options.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/options.py
class: InlineModelAdmin
```
This is the main class where the issue exists, as it handles the initialization and configuration of inline model admins, including verbose name handling.

The issue would need to be fixed in the InlineModelAdmin class's __init__ method to properly handle verbose_name_plural derivation from verbose_name, similar to how Django's model Meta class handles it. The InlineModelAdminChecks class would also need to be considered for any validation-related changes.
