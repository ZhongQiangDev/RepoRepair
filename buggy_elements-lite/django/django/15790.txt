Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when using template tag libraries with the same name in Django's TEMPLATES configuration. The error message indicates that 'my_tags' is being used for multiple template tag modules, specifically showing the same path twice: 'someapp.templatetags.my_tags'.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the template tag library registration and validation system. When Django loads template tag libraries, it's not properly handling or detecting duplicate library names, particularly when they're specified in the TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries'] setting. The system is registering the same library twice instead of recognizing it as a duplicate.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/template/library.py
class: Library
function: import_library
```
This file contains the core functionality for template tag libraries registration and management. The Library class handles registration of template tags and filters, while import_library is responsible for importing template tag modules.

```
django/template/backends/django.py
class: DjangoTemplates
function: get_installed_libraries
function: get_package_libraries
```
These components handle template library loading and initialization, including processing of template tag libraries from installed applications and custom libraries specified in settings.

```
django/template/utils.py
class: EngineHandler
```
This class manages template engine configurations and initialization, including handling of template libraries specified in settings.TEMPLATES.

```
django/core/checks/templates.py
function: check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name
```
This would be the function that should detect and prevent duplicate template tag libraries, though it's not shown in the provided code. The error message suggests this function exists and is raising the warning.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes for this specific issue.

The core of the problem likely lies in the interaction between these components, particularly in how template libraries are registered and checked for duplicates during the template engine initialization process.
