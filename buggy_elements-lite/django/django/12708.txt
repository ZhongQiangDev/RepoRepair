Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to delete an index_together constraint when there is also a unique_together constraint on the same fields. The migration crashes with a ValueError indicating it found the wrong number of constraints (2 instead of expected 1).

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that when trying to delete an index_together constraint, the schema editor is finding both the index constraint (_idx) and the unique constraint (_uniq) for the same fields. The code is not properly handling the case where multiple constraints exist on the same fields but with different types (index vs unique).

3. Examining Files:

```
django/db/backends/base/schema.py
class: BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor
```
This is highly relevant as it handles the actual schema modifications and contains the _delete_composed_index() method mentioned in the error message.

```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: AlterIndexTogether
class: AlterUniqueTogether
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the operations for modifying index_together and unique_together constraints, which are at the core of this issue.

```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for detecting changes between states and generating appropriate migration operations, including changes to indexes and unique constraints.

```
django/db/migrations/executor.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/db/migrations/migration.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core issue appears to be in the interaction between BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor's constraint handling and how AlterIndexTogether/AlterUniqueTogether operations are processed. The schema editor needs to be more selective about which constraints it considers when deleting an index_together constraint, to avoid conflicting with unique_together constraints on the same fields.
