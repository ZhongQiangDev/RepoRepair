Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using ModelChoiceIteratorValue in a dictionary key lookup operation. The error message indicates that ModelChoiceIteratorValue is not hashable, which means it cannot be used as a dictionary key.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem arises after upgrading from Django 3.0 to 3.1. In Django 3.1, the ModelChoiceField's choices iterator was modified to return ModelChoiceIteratorValue objects instead of raw values. These objects are not hashable by default, causing the error when used as dictionary keys in operations like `value in self.show_fields`.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

django/db/models/query.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/fields/mixins.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/forms/fields.py:
```
django/forms/fields.py
class: ModelChoiceField
class: ModelMultipleChoiceField
```

django/forms/models.py:
```
django/forms/models.py
class: ModelChoiceIteratorValue
```

django/forms/widgets.py:
```
django/forms/widgets.py
class: ChoiceWidget
class: Select
```

The issue is primarily related to ModelChoiceField and ModelChoiceIterator in the forms implementation, as these classes handle the choice value generation and iteration. The ChoiceWidget and Select classes are also relevant as they handle the rendering and processing of these choices in the form interface. The error occurs because the ModelChoiceIterator now returns ModelChoiceIteratorValue objects that aren't properly hashable when used as dictionary keys.
