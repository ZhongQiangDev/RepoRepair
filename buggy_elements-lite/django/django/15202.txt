Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The URLField is throwing a ValueError instead of a ValidationError when validating an invalid IPv6 URL format. This is incorrect because form fields should raise ValidationError for invalid input, not ValueError.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue occurs because the URLField's validation process uses urlsplit from urllib.parse which raises a ValueError for malformed IPv6 addresses. However, this exception should be caught and converted to a ValidationError to maintain consistent form validation behavior.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/forms/fields.py:
```
django/forms/fields.py
class: URLField
class: Field
```
This file contains the URLField class which is directly involved in the issue, as it's responsible for URL validation. The base Field class is also relevant as it defines the basic validation behavior.

django/core/validators.py:
```
django/core/validators.py
class: URLValidator
```
This file contains the URLValidator class which is used by URLField for URL validation and is directly involved in handling IPv6 addresses.

django/utils/http.py:
```
django/utils/http.py
function: _urlparse
function: _urlsplit
```
These functions are involved in the URL parsing process and are where the ValueError for invalid IPv6 addresses originates.

The other files in the provided information do not contain functions or classes directly relevant to this specific issue.

The issue appears to be a chain reaction starting from _urlsplit raising a ValueError, which propagates through _urlparse and URLValidator, finally reaching URLField where it should be caught and converted to a ValidationError but isn't.
