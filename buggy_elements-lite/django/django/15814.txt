Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using QuerySet.only() after select_related() on proxy models. The error "ValueError: 'id' is not in list" is raised when trying to access the primary key field during query execution.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because when using only() with select_related() on a proxy model, the query compiler fails to properly handle the primary key field of the related model. The issue appears to be in how the RelatedPopulator tries to find the primary key index in the init_list, but the primary key field is missing because only() restricted the fields.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

django/db/models/expressions.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/query.py:
```
django/db/models/query.py
class: QuerySet
class: ModelIterable
class: RelatedPopulator
```

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
class: ForeignKey
class: ForeignObject
```

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
class: SQLCompiler
```

django/db/models/sql/query.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
class: Query
```

The key classes involved are:
- QuerySet: Handles the only() and select_related() method chain
- ModelIterable: Responsible for iterating over query results and constructing model instances
- RelatedPopulator: Handles populating related objects, where the error occurs
- ForeignKey/ForeignObject: Define the relationship between models
- SQLCompiler: Compiles the query and handles field selection
- Query: Represents the underlying query being built

The error specifically occurs in RelatedPopulator when it tries to find the primary key index in the init_list, which is missing because only() excluded it. The suggested fix to use concrete_model._meta indicates that the proxy model handling needs to be adjusted to properly include the primary key field even when only() is used.
