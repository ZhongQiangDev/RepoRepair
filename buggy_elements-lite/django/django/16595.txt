Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The migration optimizer is not reducing multiple consecutive AlterField operations on the same field, even when they could be combined into a single operation. Specifically, when there are multiple AlterField operations modifying the same field with different attributes (like max_length, help_text, default), they remain separate instead of being consolidated into one final AlterField operation.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the reduce() method of the AlterField class. The current implementation doesn't handle the case where multiple AlterField operations are applied to the same field consecutively. The optimizer should be able to combine these operations by keeping only the final state of the field, but this logic is missing.

3. File Analysis:

django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```

django/db/migrations/migration.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
class: MigrationOptimizer
```

django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
class: AlterField
class: FieldOperation
```

The most relevant components are:
1. AlterField class - This is where the reduce() method needs to be modified to handle consecutive AlterField operations
2. MigrationOptimizer class - This is the main class responsible for optimizing migrations
3. FieldOperation class - The base class that provides core functionality for field operations
4. MigrationAutodetector class - This class may need to be aware of the optimization capabilities when detecting changes

The primary fix would need to be implemented in the AlterField.reduce() method to handle the case where operation is also an AlterField instance.
