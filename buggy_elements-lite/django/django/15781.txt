Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The help text formatting is incorrect. When using triple quotes (''') for multiline help text in a Command class, the indentation and line breaks are not being preserved as expected. The output shows all text in a single line without proper formatting.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how Django's command help formatter handles multiline help text. The indentation and line breaks from the triple-quoted string are being stripped or ignored when displaying the help message. This suggests an issue with either the help text processing in the base command system or the help formatter.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/core/management/base.py:
```
django/core/management/base.py
class: BaseCommand
class: DjangoHelpFormatter
class: CommandParser
```
This file contains the core classes responsible for command help text formatting. The BaseCommand class handles the help text attribute, DjangoHelpFormatter is responsible for formatting help output, and CommandParser uses these to generate the final help display.

django/core/management/commands/runserver.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue is most likely handled by the formatting classes in base.py, particularly:
- BaseCommand: Defines the help attribute and how it's processed
- DjangoHelpFormatter: Responsible for formatting the help text output
- CommandParser: Handles the parsing and display of command help

The DjangoHelpFormatter class appears to be the most directly related to the issue, as it's responsible for formatting the final help output. The BaseCommand class is also relevant as it's where the help text is initially defined and processed.
