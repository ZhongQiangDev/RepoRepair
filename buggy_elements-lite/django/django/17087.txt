Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when trying to use a class method from a nested class (Profile.Capability.default) as a default value for an ArrayField. The migration generator incorrectly generates the path as "appname.models.Capability.default" instead of the correct path "appname.models.Profile.Capability.default".

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the serialization process during migration generation. When the ArrayField's default value (which is a class method) needs to be serialized, the serializer fails to properly handle the nested class structure, resulting in an incorrect import path being generated. The serializer is not considering the parent class (Profile) when constructing the path for the nested class's method.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py:
```
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
class: Command
```
This class is relevant as it initiates the migration creation process.

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it detects model changes and generates migration operations.

django/db/migrations/serializer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
class: FunctionTypeSerializer
class: DeconstructableSerializer
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the serialization of functions and deconstructable objects, which is where the path construction issue occurs.

django/db/migrations/writer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/writer.py
class: MigrationWriter
class: OperationWriter
```
These classes are relevant as they handle writing the serialized operations to migration files.

django/utils/deconstruct.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely lies in the FunctionTypeSerializer class, which needs to be modified to properly handle class methods from nested classes by including the full path to the method, including all parent classes.
