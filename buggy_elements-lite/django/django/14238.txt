Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to use a custom BigAutoField subclass as DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD. The system incorrectly rejects the subclass with the error message "Primary key must subclass AutoField" even though MyBigAutoField is a valid subclass of BigAutoField.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the subclass checking logic for AutoField types. When validating the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting, Django is failing to recognize that a subclass of BigAutoField (which itself is a subclass of AutoField) should be considered valid. This suggests an issue with the inheritance validation logic.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/models/base.py:
```
django/db/models/base.py
class: ModelBase
```
This class is relevant as it handles model creation and field validation, including the processing of DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD.

django/db/models/options.py:
```
django/db/models/options.py
class: Options
```
This class is relevant as it handles model metadata and field configurations, including the validation and setup of primary key fields through _get_default_pk_class method.

django/db/models/fields/mixins.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/db/models/fields/related.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/utils/deconstruct.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely lies in the Options class's _get_default_pk_class method, which is responsible for validating the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting, and the ModelBase class which handles the overall model setup including field validation. These would be the primary locations to investigate and fix the subclass checking logic.
