Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using ExpressionWrapper with a negated Q object containing an empty pk__in list. While ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[])) works correctly and generates "SELECT 0 AS "foo" FROM "table"", ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[])) crashes and generates invalid SQL "SELECT AS "foo" FROM "table"" (missing the value before AS).

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in how ExpressionWrapper handles negated Q objects, particularly when they contain empty lists. The SQL generation is failing to properly handle the negation of an empty IN clause. When Q(pk__in=[]) is negated, it should logically evaluate to TRUE (since NOT IN empty_set is always true), but the SQL generation is failing to handle this case.

3. Relevant Files Analysis:

django/db/models/aggregates.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/expressions.py:
```
django/db/models/expressions.py
class: ExpressionWrapper
class: Q
```

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
class: SQLCompiler
```

django/db/models/sql/query.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
class: Query
```

django/db/models/sql/where.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/where.py
class: WhereNode
```

The issue likely stems from the interaction between ExpressionWrapper and the negated Q object. The ExpressionWrapper class is responsible for wrapping expressions and ensuring they generate valid SQL. The Q class and WhereNode handle the query conditions and their negation. The SQLCompiler and Query classes are involved in the actual SQL generation process.

The bug appears to be in how these components handle the special case of a negated empty IN clause, failing to generate the correct constant value (should be 1 for TRUE) in the SQL output.
