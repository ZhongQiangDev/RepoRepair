Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to serialize a combination of Enum flags (e.g., re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE). The current serialization produces "re.RegexFlag[None]" instead of the correct combination of flags.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the EnumSerializer is trying to use the .name property of the enum item, but when multiple flags are combined using bitwise operations (|), there isn't a single name that corresponds to the combined value. Instead, the serializer should decompose the combined flags into their individual components and create an expression that combines them.

3. File Analysis:

django/core/serializers/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/serializers/python.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/serializer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
class: EnumSerializer
class: RegexSerializer
class: Serializer
function: serializer_factory
```

The EnumSerializer class is directly responsible for handling the serialization of enum values, including regex flags. The RegexSerializer handles regex patterns and their flags. The Serializer class maintains the registry of serializers for different types, and serializer_factory is responsible for selecting the appropriate serializer based on the type.

The issue needs to be fixed in the EnumSerializer class to properly handle combined enum flags by:
1. Detecting when a value is a combination of flags
2. Using enum._decompose to get the individual flag names
3. Creating a serialized string that combines these flags using the OR operator (|)

The RegexSerializer would also need to be updated to properly handle the serialized flag combinations when dealing with regex patterns.
