Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when using TextChoices/IntegerChoices with a CharField/IntegerField, the value returned by the field's getter has an unexpected type. Instead of returning a string value (e.g., "first"), it returns the enum value itself (e.g., "MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE").

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in how Django handles the conversion between enum values and their actual string/integer representations when dealing with model fields that use choices from TextChoices/IntegerChoices. The value is not being properly converted to its string representation when accessed through the model instance.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

django/db/models/enums.py:
This file would be the most relevant as it handles TextChoices and IntegerChoices, but it's not included in the provided code snippets.

django/db/models/options.py:
```
django/db/models/options.py
class: Options
```
This class is relevant as it handles model metadata including choices definitions.

django/db/models/fields/proxy.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/forms/fields.py:
```
django/forms/fields.py
class: ChoiceField
class: TypedChoiceField
```
These classes are relevant as they handle choice field value conversion and validation.

django/forms/models.py:
```
django/forms/models.py
class: ModelChoiceField
class: ModelFormMetaclass
```
These classes are relevant as they handle the conversion between model field values and form field values, including choices.

The core issue likely lies in django/db/models/enums.py which isn't provided in the snippets. The problem would be in how the enum values are converted to their string representations when accessed through model instances. The conversion logic should be handling the __str__ method of the enum values to return the actual string value rather than the enum member representation.
