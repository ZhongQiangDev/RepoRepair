Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The username validators (ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator) are accepting usernames that end with a newline character, which should not be allowed.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from using `$` in the regex pattern `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'`. In Python's regex, `$` matches both the end of string AND a trailing newline. This means a string like "username\n" would be considered valid when it shouldn't be. The correct approach would be to use `\Z` instead of `$` to strictly match the end of string without allowing a trailing newline.

3. File Analysis:

django/contrib/auth/forms.py:
```
django/contrib/auth/forms.py
class: UserCreationForm
class: UsernameField
```
These classes are relevant because they handle username validation and field processing.

django/contrib/auth/validators.py:
```
django/contrib/auth/validators.py
class: ASCIIUsernameValidator
class: UnicodeUsernameValidator
```
These are the primary classes containing the problematic regex pattern that needs to be fixed.

django/core/validators.py:
```
django/core/validators.py
class: RegexValidator
```
This is relevant as it's the base class for the username validators and handles the actual regex validation.

django/forms/fields.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/utils/http.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue is primarily in the validator classes in auth/validators.py, with supporting functionality in the form classes and base RegexValidator. The fix would involve changing the regex pattern in both ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator from `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'`.
