Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to remake a table with a unique constraint in SQLite. The migration fails with the error "the "." operator prohibited in index expressions" when attempting to alter a field's max_length while having a unique constraint on that field.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how Django handles unique constraints in SQLite migrations. When creating the unique constraint, Django is using F() expressions (django.db.models.expressions.F) in the constraint definition, which SQLite doesn't support in index expressions. The error occurs during the table recreation process that SQLite requires for altering fields.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py:
```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py
class: DatabaseWrapper
```
This class is relevant as it handles SQLite-specific database operations and constraints.

django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py:
```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py
class: DatabaseSchemaEditor
```
This class is directly relevant as it handles the table recreation process for SQLite and constraint management.

django/db/migrations/executor.py:
```
django/db/migrations/executor.py
class: MigrationExecutor
```
This class is relevant as it executes the migrations and handles the migration process where the error occurs.

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: AlterField
class: AddConstraint
```
These classes are relevant as they handle field alterations and constraint additions that are involved in the error scenario.

django/db/models/constraints.py:
```
django/db/models/constraints.py
class: UniqueConstraint
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for creating and managing unique constraints, which is at the core of the issue.

The error stems from how these components interact when handling unique constraints during SQLite table recreation, particularly how the UniqueConstraint class generates SQL that's incompatible with SQLite's index expression limitations.
