Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when trying to create a model with both `order_with_respect_to` and an index that includes the `_order` field. The migration fails because the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is executed after the `AddIndex` operation, but at that point, the `_order` field hasn't been created yet.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is an incorrect operation ordering in the migration autodetector. The `_order` field is created by the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation, but the index referencing this field is being added before the field exists. This suggests that the migration autodetector needs to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operations are executed before any `AddIndex` operations that reference the `_order` field.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for detecting and ordering migration operations. It needs to be modified to ensure proper ordering of operations.

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: AlterOrderWithRespectTo
class: AddIndex
```
These classes are directly involved in the problem - they represent the operations that are being incorrectly ordered.

django/db/models/fields/proxy.py:
```
django/db/models/fields/proxy.py
class: OrderWrt
```
This class is relevant as it defines the `_order` field that's created by `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`.

django/db/migrations/executor.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/migrations/migration.py:
```
django/db/migrations/migration.py
class: Migration
```
This class is relevant as it handles the execution order of operations within a migration.

The fix would likely involve modifying the MigrationAutodetector to ensure that AlterOrderWithRespectTo operations are processed before any AddIndex operations that reference the _order field.
