Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When using an Enum object as a default value for a CharField in Django models, the migration file uses the value of the Enum object instead of its name. This causes issues when the Enum values are translated strings, as the migration file will contain the translated string instead of the Enum name constant.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how Django serializes Enum objects during migration file generation. Instead of using the Enum member name (e.g., 'GOOD'), it's using the Enum value (e.g., 'Good'). When these values are translated strings, they change based on the language, breaking the migrations since the original value no longer exists in the Enum.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
class: EnumSerializer
```
This is the primary class responsible for serializing Enum objects. The current implementation appears to use the Enum value instead of its name during serialization.

```
django/db/migrations/writer.py
class: MigrationWriter
class: OperationWriter
```
These classes handle the overall migration file generation and writing operations, including how different types are serialized.

```
django/utils/deconstruct.py
function: deconstructible
```
This decorator is relevant as it provides the serialization mechanism for model fields and their default values.

The remaining files do not contain directly relevant functions/classes for this specific issue:

```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/db/migrations/migration.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core of the issue lies in the EnumSerializer class, which needs to be modified to use the Enum member name instead of its value during serialization.
