Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Subquery.as_sql() method is incorrectly removing the first and last characters from the SQL string when generating SQL for a subquery. This results in invalid SQL output like:
'(ELECT "apps_app"."id", "apps_app"."name" FROM "apps_app")'
where the 'S' at the beginning is missing.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to the subquery flag not being properly set in the Subquery constructor. When subquery=True is manually set on the query object, the SQL is generated correctly. This suggests that the Subquery class should be setting this flag during initialization to ensure proper SQL generation.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/models/expressions.py:
```
django/db/models/expressions.py
class: Subquery
class: BaseExpression
```
This file contains the core issue in the Subquery class which inherits from BaseExpression. These classes handle SQL generation for subqueries.

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
class: SQLCompiler
```
This class is relevant as it handles the actual SQL compilation process and works with subqueries.

django/db/models/sql/query.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
class: Query
```
This class is relevant as it handles query construction and contains the subquery flag that needs to be set.

django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/db/models/sql/where.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/where.py
class: SubqueryConstraint
```
This class is relevant as it handles subquery constraints and interacts with subquery generation.

The core issue appears to be in the Subquery class implementation, with supporting roles played by the Query, SQLCompiler, and SubqueryConstraint classes in handling subquery generation and compilation.
