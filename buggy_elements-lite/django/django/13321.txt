Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When accessing any URL on the staging server after upgrading to Django 3.1, the system crashes with a session decoding error
- The issue only occurs in Chrome browser, while Firefox works fine
- The error involves invalid session data that can't be properly decoded, leading to a cascade of exceptions

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be:
- An existing session cookie contains invalid/corrupted session data
- The session data fails base64 decoding due to incorrect padding
- This triggers a BadSignature error when trying to verify the session signature
- The error handling cascade eventually fails when trying to decode the legacy session format

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/contrib/sessions/middleware.py
class: SessionMiddleware
```
This class is relevant as it handles session processing for each request and would be the first point of interaction with the corrupted session data.

```
django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py
class: SessionBase
```
This base class contains the core session handling logic including the decode() method that's failing to handle the corrupted session data.

```
django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py
class: SessionStore
```
This class handles the actual session storage and retrieval, including the load() method that's involved in the error chain.

```
django/core/signing.py
class: TimestampSigner
function: b64_decode
```
These are relevant as they handle the signature verification and base64 decoding that's failing due to incorrect padding.

For the remaining file:
```
django/contrib/sessions/models.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue appears to be primarily in the session handling and decoding logic rather than the database models themselves.
