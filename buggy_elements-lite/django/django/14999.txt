Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when a RenameModel operation is performed on a model that already has a db_table defined, it should be a no-operation (noop). However, it's currently:
- In PostgreSQL: Dropping and recreating foreign key constraints unnecessarily
- In SQLite: Recreating the table unnecessarily

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the RenameModel operation is not checking whether the model already has a custom db_table defined. When a model has a custom db_table, renaming the model should not affect the actual database table name, thus making the operation unnecessary.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py:
```
django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py
class: DatabaseSchemaEditor
```
This class is relevant as it handles the PostgreSQL-specific table renaming operations and foreign key constraint management.

django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py:
```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py
class: DatabaseSchemaEditor
```
This class is relevant as it handles SQLite-specific table renaming operations.

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:
```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: RenameModel
class: AlterModelTable
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle model renaming operations and table name alterations.

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for detecting model changes and generating appropriate migration operations.

django/db/migrations/executor.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue needs to be fixed primarily in the RenameModel operation class, where it should check if the model has a custom db_table defined before proceeding with the rename operation. If a custom db_table exists, it should become a no-op instead of performing unnecessary table operations.
