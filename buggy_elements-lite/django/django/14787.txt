Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using `method_decorator` with a decorator that expects a function with standard attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. The error shows that the decorator is receiving a `functools.partial` object which lacks these expected attributes, causing an AttributeError.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how `method_decorator` handles the conversion of instance methods to functions. When wrapping methods, it creates a partial object to bind the method to the instance, but doesn't properly preserve or copy the original function attributes to this partial object. This becomes problematic when other decorators (like the logger in the example) try to access these standard function attributes.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/core/management/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/utils/decorators.py:
```
django/utils/decorators.py
function: method_decorator
function: _multi_decorate
function: _update_method_wrapper
```

django/views/decorators/csrf.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/views/decorators/http.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The core issue lies in the django/utils/decorators.py file, specifically in the `method_decorator`, `_multi_decorate`, and `_update_method_wrapper` functions. These functions are responsible for handling the decoration of class methods and the preservation of function attributes. The bug occurs in how these functions handle the creation and attribute preservation of partial objects when converting instance methods to standalone functions for decoration.
