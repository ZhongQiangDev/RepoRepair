Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that BoundWidget.id_for_label() ignores the ID that was set through ChoiceWidget.options. When rendering labels for subwidgets (like in CheckboxSelectMultiple), the ID is being regenerated using a hardcoded format ('id_%s_%s' % (name, index)) instead of using the ID that was already set in the widget's attributes.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how BoundWidget.id_for_label() is implemented. Instead of using the ID from self.data['attrs']['id'] which contains the properly formatted ID from the widget's attributes, it generates a new ID using only the name and index. This causes any custom ID formatting or settings to be ignored.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/forms/boundfield.py:
```
django/forms/boundfield.py
class: BoundField
class: BoundWidget
```
These classes are directly involved in the issue as they handle the binding of fields and widgets to forms and the generation of IDs for labels.

django/forms/widgets.py:
```
django/forms/widgets.py
class: ChoiceWidget
class: CheckboxSelectMultiple
```
These classes are relevant because they handle the creation and management of choice widgets and their options, including setting IDs and attributes.

django/forms/fields.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue is primarily about widget rendering and ID generation, not field-level functionality.

The core of the problem lies in the interaction between BoundWidget and ChoiceWidget, specifically in how IDs are handled during the rendering process. The fix would involve modifying BoundWidget.id_for_label() to respect the ID that was set through the widget's attributes rather than generating a new one.
