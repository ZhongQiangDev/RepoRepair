Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `.distinct()` operation is not working correctly when applied after `.union()` and `.annotate()` operations. The test case shows that even with duplicate 'Dub' entries, the distinct operation is not reducing them to a single entry.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the DISTINCT clause is being handled in the SQL generation when combining annotated querysets with UNION. The test expects the DISTINCT ON clause to be wrapped around the entire UNION query, but it's likely being applied incorrectly in the query compilation process.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

django/db/models/aggregates.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/db/models/expressions.py:
```
django/db/models/expressions.py
class: CombinedExpression
class: Value
```

django/db/models/query.py:
```
django/db/models/query.py
class: QuerySet
```

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
class: SQLCompiler
```

django/db/models/sql/query.py:
```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
class: Query
```

The issue likely stems from how the Query and QuerySet classes handle the combination of UNION operations with DISTINCT clauses, and how these are translated into SQL by the SQLCompiler. The CombinedExpression class would be involved in handling the UNION operation, while Value would be used for the annotated values. The Query class would be responsible for maintaining the state of the query including the DISTINCT flag, and the SQLCompiler would generate the final SQL with the incorrect DISTINCT placement.

The core of the issue appears to be in how these components interact to generate the SQL, specifically in how the DISTINCT clause is positioned relative to the UNION subquery in the final SQL output.
