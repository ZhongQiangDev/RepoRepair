Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that a deprecation warning is being raised for ManagementForm's template rendering, even though the user never explicitly renders forms using {{ form }} expression. The warning appears during formset management form production, where the template choice is not significant since only hidden inputs are produced.

2. Cause Analysis:
The cause appears to be that the ManagementForm class, which is used internally by formsets to handle form counts and management data, is triggering Django's template deprecation warning system. This happens even though the template rendering for management forms only produces hidden inputs and the template choice doesn't affect the output.

3. Examining Files:

django/forms/forms.py:
```
django/forms/forms.py
class: BaseForm
class: Form
```
These classes are relevant as they provide the base form functionality that ManagementForm inherits from.

django/forms/formsets.py:
```
django/forms/formsets.py
class: BaseFormSet
class: ManagementForm
```
These classes are directly relevant as ManagementForm is the source of the issue, and BaseFormSet uses ManagementForm to handle form management data.

django/forms/widgets.py:
```
django/forms/widgets.py
class: HiddenInput
class: Widget
```
These classes are relevant because ManagementForm uses HiddenInput widgets for its fields, and Widget is the base class that handles template rendering.

django/template/response.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/template/backends/django.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue primarily involves the interaction between ManagementForm, its parent form classes, and the widget system that handles the actual rendering of form fields.
