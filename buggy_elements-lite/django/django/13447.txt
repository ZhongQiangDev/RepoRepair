Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Identify the wrong behavior:
The issue is that the app_list in the custom admin view only contains serialized model information, without access to the actual model class. This makes it difficult to manipulate the app_list effectively.

2. Analyze the cause:
The cause appears to be in the AdminSite's _build_app_dict method, which creates a dictionary of apps and models for the admin interface. Currently, this method only includes serialized model information without including a reference to the actual model class.

3. Examining relevant files:

django/apps/registry.py:
```
django/apps/registry.py
class: Apps
```
This class is relevant as it maintains the central registry of all models and could be used to access model classes.

django/contrib/admin/apps.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/contrib/admin/options.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

django/contrib/admin/sites.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/sites.py
class: AdminSite
```
This class is highly relevant as it contains the _build_app_dict method that needs modification to include model class information.

django/db/models/base.py:
```
django/db/models/base.py
class: Model
class: ModelBase
```
These classes are relevant as they represent the base model functionality and metaclass that all Django models inherit from, which would be needed to properly reference model classes.

The core issue appears to be in the AdminSite class's _build_app_dict method, which needs to be modified to include model class references alongside the serialized model information. The Apps registry class would be useful for accessing these model classes, while Model and ModelBase provide the fundamental model functionality that needs to be referenced.
