Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that django.utils.html.json_script() function has a hardcoded DjangoJSONEncoder and doesn't allow customization of the JSON encoder. This limits flexibility when users need to customize how certain values are encoded to JSON.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that the json_script() function in django.utils.html.py uses a hardcoded DjangoJSONEncoder class for JSON serialization, without providing a parameter to allow users to specify their own encoder class. This makes it impossible to customize the JSON encoding behavior for special data types or custom serialization needs.

3. Examining Files:

django/core/serializers/base.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/core/serializers/json.py:
```
django/core/serializers/json.py
class: DjangoJSONEncoder
```

django/template/defaultfilters.py:
```
django/template/defaultfilters.py
function: json_script
```

django/utils/html.py:
```
django/utils/html.py
function: json_script
```

django/utils/safestring.py:
```
django/utils/safestring.py
function: mark_safe
class: SafeString
```

The most relevant locations are in django/utils/html.py and django/core/serializers/json.py, as they contain the json_script function that needs modification and the DjangoJSONEncoder class that's currently hardcoded. The other relevant functions/classes are involved in the JSON encoding and HTML safety process but are more peripheral to the core issue.

The solution would involve modifying the json_script function to accept an optional encoder parameter that defaults to DjangoJSONEncoder, similar to how Python's json.dumps() allows customization of its encoder.
