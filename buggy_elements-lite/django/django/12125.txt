Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When using inner classes that inherit from django.db.models.Field within another class, Django's makemigrations command generates incorrect import paths in the migration files. Instead of using the full path including the outer class (e.g., test1.models.Outer.Inner), it incorrectly uses just the inner class name (e.g., test1.models.Inner).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the serialization process during migration generation. When Django serializes model fields, it's not properly handling the path construction for inner classes. The serializer is likely only capturing the innermost class name without considering its containing class hierarchy.

3. Examining Files:

django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py:
```
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
class: Command
```
This class is relevant as it initiates the migration creation process.

django/db/migrations/autodetector.py:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it detects model changes and generates migration operations.

django/db/migrations/serializer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
class: DeconstructableSerializer
class: ModelFieldSerializer
```
These classes are directly relevant as they handle the serialization of model fields and their paths.

django/db/migrations/writer.py:
```
django/db/migrations/writer.py
class: MigrationWriter
class: OperationWriter
```
These classes are relevant as they write the final migration file and handle the formatting of operations.

django/utils/deconstruct.py:
```
django/utils/deconstruct.py
function: deconstructible
```
This function is relevant as it provides the deconstructible decorator that enables field serialization.

The core issue likely lies in the DeconstructableSerializer class, which is responsible for serializing the field's path. When handling inner classes, it's not properly constructing the full path including the outer class name.
