Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The system is raising models.W042 warnings for models that inherit from other models with manually specified primary keys. The warning suggests that auto-created primary keys are being used when they shouldn't be, as the primary keys should be inherited from the parent models.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to Django 3.2's migration system not properly recognizing inherited primary keys during model inspection. When a model inherits from another model that has a manually specified primary key, the migration system is incorrectly assuming that an auto-created primary key is needed, even though the primary key should be inherited from the parent model.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
class: MigrationAutodetector
```
This class is relevant as it's responsible for detecting model changes and generating appropriate migrations. It needs to properly handle inherited primary keys.

```
django/db/models/base.py
class: ModelBase
class: Model
```
These classes are relevant because they handle model inheritance and field management. The ModelBase metaclass is particularly important as it processes model inheritance during class creation.

```
django/db/migrations/migration.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
class: CreateModel
```
This class is relevant because it handles the creation of new models in migrations and needs to properly handle inherited fields, including primary keys.

The issue likely stems from the interaction between MigrationAutodetector, ModelBase, Model, and CreateModel classes, where the inheritance chain of primary keys is not being properly tracked during migration generation.
