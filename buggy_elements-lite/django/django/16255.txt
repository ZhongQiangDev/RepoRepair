Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When a sitemap contains no items but has a callable lastmod method defined, it raises a ValueError with the message "max() arg is an empty sequence" when trying to get the latest modification date.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the get_latest_lastmod() method tries to calculate the maximum lastmod value from an empty sequence of items. When there are no items but lastmod is defined as a callable, the list comprehension [self.lastmod(item) for item in self.items()] creates an empty list, and calling max() on an empty sequence raises ValueError.

3. Examining Files:

django/contrib/flatpages/sitemaps.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py:
```
django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py
function: index
```
This function is relevant because it calls site.get_latest_lastmod() which triggers the error.

django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py:
```
django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py
class: Sitemap
```
This is the main class where the error occurs, specifically in its get_latest_lastmod method which attempts to calculate the maximum lastmod value from potentially empty sequences.

The core issue lies in the Sitemap class's get_latest_lastmod method, and the fix needs to handle the ValueError that occurs when trying to calculate max() on an empty sequence. The index view function is also relevant as it's the entry point where this error surfaces in the traceback.
