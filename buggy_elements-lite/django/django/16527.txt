Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that users can use the "Save as new" functionality in Django admin even without having the proper add permission. This is a security concern as it allows users to create new objects when they shouldn't have that capability.

2. Cause Analysis:
The cause appears to be in the template tag logic that determines whether to show the "Save as new" button. Currently, it only checks for:
- Not being in popup mode
- Having change permission
- Being in change mode
- save_as flag being enabled

It's missing a crucial check for add permission, which should be required since "Save as new" effectively creates a new object.

3. File Analysis:

django/contrib/admin/models.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

django/contrib/admin/options.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/options.py
class: ModelAdmin
```
This class is relevant because it handles the save_as functionality and permissions in the admin interface.

django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py:
```
django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py
function: submit_row
```
This function is directly relevant as it determines which buttons (including "Save as new") should be displayed in the admin interface based on permissions and context.

The core issue lies in the submit_row function in admin_modify.py, which needs to include the additional permission check for "show_save_as_new". The ModelAdmin class is also relevant as it provides the permission checking methods that should be used to determine if a user can perform add operations.
