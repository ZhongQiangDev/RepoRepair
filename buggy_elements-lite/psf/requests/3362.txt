Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Identify the wrong behavior:
The user is experiencing unexpected behavior where `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` returns bytes instead of unicode strings, while `r.text` returns unicode as expected. The user expected both methods to return unicode when decode_unicode=True.

2. Analyze the cause:
The issue likely stems from how the response content decoding is handled differently between direct text access and iterative content reading. The `text` property probably handles encoding detection and conversion in one go, while `iter_content` might have a different decoding pathway that's not working as expected with the decode_unicode parameter.

3. Examining relevant files:

requests/models.py:
```
requests/models.py
class: Response
```
This is the main class responsible for handling HTTP responses and content decoding. It contains both the `text` property and `iter_content` method that are central to this issue.

requests/utils.py:
```
requests/utils.py
function: get_encoding_from_headers
function: get_encodings_from_content
function: stream_decode_response_unicode
```
These functions are relevant as they handle encoding detection and unicode decoding of response content, which are directly related to the text decoding issue.

requests/packages/chardet/sbcharsetprober.py:
```
requests/packages/chardet/sbcharsetprober.py
class: SingleByteCharSetProber
```
This class is relevant as it's part of the character encoding detection system that might be used when determining how to decode response content.

requests/packages/chardet/utf8prober.py:
```
requests/packages/chardet/utf8prober.py
class: UTF8Prober
```
This class is also relevant as it specifically handles UTF-8 encoding detection, which is commonly used in HTTP responses.

requests/packages/urllib3/response.py:
```
requests/packages/urllib3/response.py
class: HTTPResponse
```
This class is relevant as it's the underlying response handler that provides the raw content reading capabilities that `Response` builds upon.

The other files contain no relevant functions/classes.
