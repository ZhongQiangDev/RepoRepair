Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The pytest JUnit XML reports are missing two important properties in the `testsuite` XML element:
- `hostname`: The machine name where tests were run
- `timestamp`: When the tests were executed

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in pytest's XML report generation functionality. The JUnit XML report generator is not including these standard JUnit XML attributes that are typically present in JUnit reports from other testing frameworks. This suggests the XML report generation code needs to be modified to include these additional attributes.

3. Examining Files:
Let's go through each file to identify relevant code:

testing/python/collect.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/python/integration.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The provided files don't contain the relevant code for XML report generation. The issue would likely be found in pytest's XML reporting module, which would contain classes/functions for:
- Creating the XML report structure
- Generating the testsuite XML elements
- Adding attributes to XML elements

However, these files are not included in the provided codebase. The fix would need to be implemented in pytest's XML reporting module, likely in a file like `_pytest/junitxml.py` or similar, where the XML report generation logic would reside.

The solution would involve modifying the XML generation code to:
1. Get the hostname from the system
2. Get the current timestamp
3. Add these as attributes when creating the testsuite XML element
