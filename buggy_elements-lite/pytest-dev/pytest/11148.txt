Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The issue occurs when `core.initialize()` is called and sets `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store`, but this value is not accessible in the test.
- The error shows that `Logger.store` is not found, even though it should have been set.
- There are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` module present in the system.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The root cause appears to be a module import duplication issue.
- When switching from pkg_resources style namespace packaging to PEP 420 namespace packages, the import system is creating two separate instances of the same module.
- This is evidenced by the fact that `sys.modules['pmxbot.logging'] is logging` returns False, indicating two different module objects.
- The initialization sets the attribute on one module instance, but the test is trying to access it from the other instance.

3. Examining Relevant Files:

```
testing/python/collect.py
class: TestModule
```
This class is relevant as it contains tests for module import behavior and duplicate imports, particularly in the `test_import_duplicate` method which handles similar scenarios.

```
testing/python/fixtures.py
class: TestFixtureManagerParseFactories
```
This class is relevant as it deals with fixture initialization and module-level state management, which could help understand how to properly handle module-level state in tests.

```
testing/python/integration.py
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue appears to be primarily related to Python's import system and module initialization rather than test integration features, so this file's contents are not directly relevant to the problem at hand.

The key locations identified are focused on module import handling and fixture management, which are the core aspects of the reported issue. The TestModule class specifically deals with duplicate module imports, while TestFixtureManagerParseFactories handles module-level state management in the context of pytest fixtures.
