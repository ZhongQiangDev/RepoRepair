Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `skip` at module level without `allow_module_level=True`, pytest continues processing the file and fails when encountering Python 3.8 syntax in older Python versions.
- The error message suggests using `pytestmark` but this solution doesn't work for the use case since the file still gets processed.
- The error message discourages using `skip` as a function, even though it's actually the correct solution with `allow_module_level=True`.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The root cause appears to be in how pytest handles module-level skip directives and the associated error messaging.
- The error message is misleading as it suggests using `pytestmark` which doesn't prevent file processing.
- The `skip` function with `allow_module_level=True` is the correct solution but is not properly documented or recommended in the error message.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

testing/python/collect.py:
```
class TestModule:
- This class is relevant as it handles module-level test collection and contains tests for module import behavior and error handling.
```

testing/python/metafunc.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

testing/python/raises.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

The issue primarily relates to module-level test collection and skip handling, which is primarily handled in the TestModule class. The problem involves how pytest processes modules during collection and how it handles skip directives at the module level. The TestModule class contains tests related to module collection behavior, making it the most relevant to this issue.

The other files (metafunc.py and raises.py) focus on different aspects of pytest (parameter handling and exception testing respectively) and don't contain code directly relevant to the module-level skip functionality or its error messaging.
