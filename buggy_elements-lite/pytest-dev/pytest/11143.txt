Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when pytest attempts to collect test cases and encounters a file where the first expression is a number that is mistakenly interpreted as a docstring. This causes a TypeError with the message "argument of type 'int' is not iterable" during the assertion rewriting phase.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the assertion rewriting process when pytest tries to check if "PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE" is in the docstring. However, when the first expression in a file is a number literal, it's incorrectly being treated as a docstring, and since an integer is not iterable, the check fails with a TypeError.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py:
```
class: AssertionRewriter
function: rewrite_asserts
function: _rewrite_test
```
This is the most relevant file as it contains the assertion rewriting logic. The AssertionRewriter class handles the rewriting process, and specifically its is_rewrite_disabled method is where the error occurs when trying to check for "PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE" in what it thinks is a docstring.

doc/en/example/nonpython/conftest.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/python/collect.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The issue is primarily in the assertion rewriting mechanism, specifically in how docstrings are identified and handled during the rewriting process. The fix would need to be in the AssertionRewriter class to properly check if what it's treating as a docstring is actually a docstring before attempting to iterate over it.

The error occurs because the code assumes that any first expression in a module could be a docstring and tries to check if it contains "PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE", but it doesn't properly verify that the expression is actually a string before attempting to iterate over it.
