Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when pytest encounters an exception in `__repr__` or `__getattribute__` methods during test execution. Instead of properly handling and reporting these exceptions, pytest encounters an INTERNALERROR with "RuntimeError: No active exception to reraise".

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be improper exception handling in pytest's reporting mechanism when dealing with special methods (`__repr__` and `__getattribute__`) that raise bare exceptions using `raise` without an argument. When pytest tries to format the test failure report, it needs to call these special methods, which then raise exceptions improperly, leading to the internal error.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

testing/python/collect.py:
```
class TestClass
```
This class contains test methods for validating pytest's collection behavior, including how it handles classes with special methods.

testing/python/fixtures.py:
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

testing/python/raises.py:
```
class TestRaises
```
This class is relevant as it tests pytest's exception handling mechanisms, which is directly related to the issue of handling raised exceptions.

The issue primarily stems from pytest's internal error handling when dealing with special methods during test collection and reporting. The most relevant components are those dealing with test collection and exception handling, particularly in the TestClass and TestRaises classes. These classes contain tests that verify pytest's behavior when encountering various types of exceptions and special method implementations.

The fix would likely involve improving how pytest handles exceptions raised from special methods during test reporting, ensuring proper exception context is maintained throughout the process.
