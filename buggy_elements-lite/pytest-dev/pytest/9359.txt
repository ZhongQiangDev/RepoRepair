Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when a test assertion fails in Python 3.9, the error message includes extra code (specifically a decorator definition) that appears after the failing assertion line. This extra code is not relevant to the failure and makes the error message harder to read. This behavior does not occur in Python 3.7.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how pytest calculates and displays the line numbers and context for assertion failures in Python 3.9. The problem specifically involves how pytest handles code that appears after the failing assertion, particularly when decorators are present. This suggests an issue with pytest's source code inspection and error reporting mechanism.

3. Examining Relevant Files:
Let's analyze each file for relevant code:

testing/python/collect.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/python/fixtures.py:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

testing/python/raises.py:
```
class: TestRaises
```
This class is relevant because it handles pytest's assertion and error reporting mechanisms, which is directly related to how assertion failures are displayed.

The issue likely stems from pytest's core assertion rewriting and error reporting mechanisms. However, in the provided files, only the TestRaises class appears directly relevant as it deals with error reporting and assertion handling. The bug might be in pytest's core assertion rewriting code, which isn't shown in these files.

The fix would likely need to modify how pytest determines which lines of code to include in the error message, particularly in Python 3.9+ where the AST handling might have changed. The TestRaises class would be a good starting point for understanding how pytest handles assertion failures and error reporting.
