Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when creating temporary directories in pytest when the username contains illegal characters for directory names. Specifically, when using `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory`, or `tmp_path_factory`, the creation fails if the username contains backslashes (e.g., "contoso\john_doe").

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that pytest uses `getpass.getuser()` to get the username for creating temporary directory paths. When running through SSH on Windows, this function returns the domain username format (e.g., "contoso\john_doe") which contains backslashes. These backslashes are illegal characters for directory names, causing the directory creation to fail.

3. Relevant Functions/Classes Analysis:

src/_pytest/pathlib.py:
```
function: make_numbered_dir
function: make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup
```
These functions are relevant because they handle the actual creation of numbered temporary directories and would fail when trying to create directories with illegal characters.

src/_pytest/tmpdir.py:
```
function: get_user
class: TempPathFactory
class: TempdirFactory
```
These are relevant because:
- `get_user` directly calls `getpass.getuser()` which is the source of the problematic username
- `TempPathFactory` and `TempdirFactory` are responsible for managing temporary directory creation and use the username in their path construction

The issue primarily stems from the `get_user` function not sanitizing the username before it's used in path construction, and the temporary directory factories not properly handling usernames containing illegal characters.

The other functions in these files, while part of the temporary directory management system, are not directly related to the core issue of username handling and directory name validation.
