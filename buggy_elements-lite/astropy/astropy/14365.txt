Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The ascii.qdp table format reader crashes when reading QDP files that contain lowercase commands (e.g., "read serr 1 2") instead of uppercase commands (e.g., "READ SERR 1 2"). However, QDP itself is case-insensitive and should accept commands in any case.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be that the QDP table reader is strictly checking for uppercase commands without implementing case-insensitive matching. When it encounters lowercase commands, it fails to recognize them as valid QDP commands and raises a ValueError with "Unrecognized QDP line".

3. Examining Relevant Files:

astropy/io/ascii/core.py:
```
astropy/io/ascii/core.py
class: BaseReader
```
This class is relevant as it's the base class for reading ASCII tables and would contain core functionality for line processing and error handling.

astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py:
This file would contain the specific QDP format implementation, but it wasn't provided in the file information. This would be the primary location where the case-sensitivity issue needs to be fixed.

For all other files in the provided information:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

Note: The main fix would likely need to be implemented in the QDP-specific reader class in astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py, which wasn't provided in the file information. The BaseReader class from core.py would be involved as it provides the foundation for all ASCII table readers, but the specific case-sensitivity issue would need to be addressed in the QDP format implementation.
