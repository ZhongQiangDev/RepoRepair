Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The separability matrix computation is incorrect for nested CompoundModels. When a CompoundModel (cm = Linear1D(10) & Linear1D(5)) is nested within another model (m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm), the separability matrix shows that the inputs and outputs are no longer separable, even though they should be.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the separability matrix is computed for nested compound models. When dealing with nested models, the code likely fails to properly traverse the model tree structure and maintain the separability information of the inner compound models. The separability computation seems to treat the nested compound model as a single unit rather than preserving the individual separability properties of its components.

3. Relevant Files/Functions Analysis:

astropy/modeling/core.py:
```
astropy/modeling/core.py
class: _CompoundModel
class: _CompoundModelMeta
```
These classes handle compound model creation and operations, including how nested models are structured and evaluated.

astropy/modeling/mappings.py:
```
astropy/modeling/mappings.py
class: Identity
class: Mapping
```
These classes are relevant as they handle input-output mappings which affect separability calculations.

astropy/modeling/separable.py:
```
astropy/modeling/separable.py
function: separability_matrix
function: _separable
function: _cstack
```
These functions are directly responsible for computing the separability matrix and handling the coordinate transformations that determine separability.

The remaining files contain no relevant functions/classes.

The core issue likely lies in the interaction between the _CompoundModel handling in core.py and the separability computation functions in separable.py, particularly in how _separable and _cstack handle nested compound models.
