Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `:inherited-members:` option in Sphinx automodule doesn't support specifying multiple base classes to ignore
- When a class inherits from multiple classes, there's no way to selectively document members from some base classes while ignoring others
- For modules with multiple classes inheriting from built-in types (list, set, tuple), there's no way to globally ignore these built-in members while documenting other inherited members

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Sphinx's autodoc system handles inherited members during documentation generation
- The current implementation likely only supports a boolean flag for inherited-members rather than a list of classes to ignore
- The core functionality would be in the autodoc extension files that handle class inheritance and member documentation

3. Most Related Files:
```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
sphinx/util/inspect.py
sphinx/domains/python.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `autodoc/directive.py` contains the core AutodocDirective class that handles autodoc directives and their options
- `autodoc/mock.py` handles mocking of imported modules/classes which is relevant for inheritance handling
- `autodoc/typehints.py` deals with type hints and class relationships
- `util/inspect.py` provides utilities for inspecting class hierarchies and inherited members
- `domains/python.py` contains Python-specific documentation handling including class inheritance documentation

These files would need to be modified to implement support for selective inherited member documentation based on base classes.
