Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When `rst_prolog` is set in conf.py, top-level headings containing a domain directive (like `:mod:`) are not rendered correctly
- These headings are also not included in the toctree
- The issue occurs specifically when using domain directives (e.g. `:mod:`) in headings, and only when `rst_prolog` is set

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how Sphinx processes domain directives in section titles when `rst_prolog` is present
- The problem likely occurs during the parsing/processing phase of RST documents
- Since it involves both domain directives and document structure (headings/toctree), it's likely related to the RST parser and domain handling components
- The presence of `rst_prolog` somehow interferes with proper processing of domain directives in section titles

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sphinx/parsers.py
sphinx/domains/std.py
sphinx/environment/collectors/title.py
sphinx/directives/other.py
sphinx/util/rst.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `parsers.py` contains the core RST parsing logic and handles `rst_prolog`
- `domains/std.py` manages domain directives and their processing
- `environment/collectors/title.py` handles title collection and processing
- `directives/other.py` contains toctree-related directive processing
- `util/rst.py` provides utilities for RST processing and heading handling
