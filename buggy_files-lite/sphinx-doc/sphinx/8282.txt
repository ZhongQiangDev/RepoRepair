Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `autodoc_typehints = 'none'` setting in conf.py is not being respected for overloaded functions. The type hints are still being shown in the documentation despite the setting indicating they should be hidden.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how Sphinx's autodoc extension processes type hints for overloaded functions. The `autodoc_typehints` setting is not being properly applied when processing signatures of functions decorated with `@overload`. This suggests the issue lies in the type hint processing logic specific to overloaded functions in the autodoc system.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py
sphinx/domains/python.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py
sphinx/util/typing.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` is most relevant as it directly handles type hint processing in autodoc
- `sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py` manages autodoc directives and their options like `autodoc_typehints`
- `sphinx/domains/python.py` handles Python-specific documentation features including function signatures
- `sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py` could be involved in processing overloaded functions
- `sphinx/util/typing.py` provides utility functions for type hint string conversion
