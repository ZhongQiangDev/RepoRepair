Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When `__all__ = []` is defined in a Python module, autodoc still shows all functions (foo, bar, baz) in the documentation
- Expected behavior is that no entries should be shown since `__all__` is empty

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Sphinx's autodoc extension handles empty `__all__` attributes
- The autodoc system should respect `__all__` as a way to explicitly control which names are considered public and should be documented
- When `__all__` is empty, it should be interpreted as "no names should be documented" rather than being ignored
- This suggests the issue is in the autodoc implementation's handling of `__all__` during member detection and filtering

3. Most Related Files:
```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
sphinx/domains/python.py
sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `autodoc/directive.py` contains the core autodoc directive implementation that handles member detection and filtering
- `autodoc/mock.py` deals with module imports and attribute handling which could affect `__all__` processing
- `autodoc/typehints.py` handles type information processing which may interact with member filtering
- `domains/python.py` contains Python-specific documentation handling including module attributes
- `autosummary/generate.py` handles automatic documentation generation which may influence how members are processed

The issue most likely needs to be fixed in the autodoc directive implementation to properly respect empty `__all__` attributes.
