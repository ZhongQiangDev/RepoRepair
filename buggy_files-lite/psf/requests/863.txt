Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Request class's `.register_hook()` method doesn't properly handle lists of hook functions in the hooks argument
- When passing a list of hook functions per hook, the code wraps the list in another list, making it uncallable
- This prevents using multiple hooks from a session

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how Request.__init__() processes the hooks parameter
- Instead of properly handling lists of functions as valid values in the hooks dictionary, it wraps them in an additional list layer
- This causes failures when trying to execute the hooks since a list isn't callable

3. Most Related Files:
```
requests/models.py
requests/hooks.py
requests/sessions.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- models.py contains the Request class implementation where the hook registration and initialization happens
- hooks.py would contain the hook-related functionality and definitions
- sessions.py handles session-level hooks that are affected by this issue

I limited to 3 files since these appear to be the core files involved in hook handling and the described issue.
