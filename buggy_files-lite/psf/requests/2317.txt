Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The method parameter is being converted from a binary string (b'GET') to a literal string ("b'GET'") which causes a 404 Not Found response
- This only happens in Python 3.4, not in Python 2.6

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from neutronclient using `utils.safe_encode_list()` which converts values to binary strings
- In requests/sessions.py, `builtin_str(method)` is converting the binary string to a literal string representation
- This string conversion issue is related to Python 2 vs 3 string handling differences
- The requests library is not properly handling binary string methods

3. Most relevant files (ordered by importance):

```
requests/sessions.py
requests/models.py
requests/api.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- sessions.py contains the problematic `builtin_str(method)` code
- models.py handles the core request functionality and method processing
- api.py provides the high-level interface for making requests and would be involved in method handling

The issue appears to be primarily in the string handling within sessions.py, with the other files being part of the request processing chain that could need adjustment to properly handle binary strings across Python versions.
