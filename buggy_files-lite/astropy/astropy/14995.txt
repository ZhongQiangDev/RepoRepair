Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When performing arithmetic operations (specifically multiplication) on NDDataRef objects where one operand has a mask and the other doesn't, it raises a TypeError about unsupported operand types for bitwise OR between 'int' and 'NoneType'
- This happens in v5.3 but works fine in v5.2

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs during mask propagation in arithmetic operations
- When one operand has no mask, it seems to be treated as None instead of being properly handled
- The bitwise_or operation fails because it tries to perform the operation between integer values from the existing mask and None from the no-mask operand
- The mask handling logic in arithmetic operations needs to properly handle cases where one operand lacks a mask

3. Most Related Files:
```
astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py
astropy/nddata/nddata.py
astropy/nddata/compat.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- ndarithmetic.py contains the core arithmetic operations and mask handling logic for NDData objects
- nddata.py defines the base NDData class and its core functionality including mask handling
- compat.py contains NDDataArray which combines arithmetic operations with other NDData features

The issue likely stems from changes in how masks are handled during arithmetic operations in these files between v5.2 and v5.3.
