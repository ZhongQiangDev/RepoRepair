Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `get_safe_settings()` function is not properly cleansing sensitive data in nested iterables (lists, tuples) within settings. While it cleanses top-level sensitive keys and dictionary values, it fails to recursively cleanse sensitive data within nested structures.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the `cleanse_setting()` function only handling dictionary types but not other iterables. When encountering lists or nested structures containing dictionaries with sensitive data (keys like 'secret', 'token'), these values are returned as-is instead of being cleansed with asterisks ('**********').

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/views/debug.py
django/core/exceptions.py
django/utils/safestring.py
django/core/management/commands/diffsettings.py
django/core/checks/security/base.py
```

Reasoning:
- `django/views/debug.py` is most important as it contains the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class that handles settings cleansing
- `django/core/exceptions.py` contains core exception handling that would interact with the debug views
- `django/utils/safestring.py` provides safety-related string handling utilities
- `django/core/management/commands/diffsettings.py` deals with settings comparison and display
- `django/core/checks/security/base.py` handles security-related checks
