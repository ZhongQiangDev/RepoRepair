Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a message with empty string extra_tags ("") is serialized and then deserialized, the extra_tags becomes None instead of preserving the empty string
- This causes errors in templates when checking `if x not in message.extra_tags` because None is not iterable

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs in the MessageEncoder class when serializing messages
- The encoder checks for truthiness of extra_tags rather than explicitly checking if it's None
- Empty string "" is falsy in Python, so it gets treated the same as None during serialization
- This causes loss of distinction between None and empty string during the serialize/deserialize cycle

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):

```
django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py
django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py
django/contrib/messages/api.py
django/contrib/messages/storage/session.py
django/contrib/messages/middleware.py
```

Reasoning:
- cookie.py is most important as it contains the MessageEncoder/MessageDecoder classes where the bug occurs
- base.py contains the core Message class definition 
- api.py contains the message creation functions that set default empty string extra_tags
- session.py handles message storage similar to cookie storage
- middleware.py manages the message lifecycle but is less directly related to the serialization issue
