Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A deprecation warning is being raised for "default.html" template when using ManagementForm, even though the template is never explicitly rendered using {{ form }}
- This warning appears unnecessary since the template is only used for hidden inputs

2. Cause Analysis:
- The ManagementForm in formsets is triggering a template deprecation warning
- The warning occurs because Django is checking template usage even for hidden form fields
- The template check appears to be too aggressive, flagging template usage even when the actual rendering is minimal (just hidden inputs)

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/forms/formsets.py
django/forms/forms.py
django/forms/widgets.py
django/template/backends/django.py
django/template/response.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- formsets.py contains the ManagementForm class that's triggering the warning
- forms.py contains the base Form class that ManagementForm inherits from
- widgets.py handles the actual rendering of form fields including hidden inputs
- django.py contains the template backend that processes template loading/deprecation
- response.py handles template response rendering which may affect warning generation
