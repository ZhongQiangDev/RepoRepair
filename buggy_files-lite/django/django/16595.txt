Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The migration optimizer is not reducing multiple consecutive AlterField operations on the same field, even when they could be consolidated into a single operation. Specifically, when multiple AlterField operations modify the same field sequentially, they remain separate instead of being optimized into one final operation.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the AlterField operation's reduce method, which doesn't handle the case where consecutive operations are also AlterField operations. The optimizer should be able to combine multiple AlterField operations into a single one that represents the final state of the field, but this logic is missing from the reduction process.

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- optimizer.py contains the core optimization logic that should be handling these reductions
- operations/fields.py contains the AlterField operation class where the reduce method needs modification
- autodetector.py is responsible for generating migration operations
- makemigrations.py is the command that triggers the optimization process
- migration.py provides the base Migration class that ties everything together

The fix would primarily involve modifying the reduce method in operations/fields.py and potentially adjusting the optimization logic in optimizer.py.
