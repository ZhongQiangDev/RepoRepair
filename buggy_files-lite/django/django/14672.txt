I'll analyze this problem and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves a `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` error when running Django model checks. This occurs specifically when checking proxy models with ManyToManyField relationships that use the `through_fields` parameter as a list.

## Analyzing the Cause
The error happens because:
1. In Django 3.2, an `identity` property was added to `ForeignObjectRel` classes to make them comparable
2. This identity is used to generate a hash value in the `__hash__` method
3. The `through_fields` attribute in `ManyToManyRel` can be a list, which is unhashable in Python
4. While other similar attributes (like `limit_choices_to`) are processed with `make_hashable`, the `through_fields` attribute is missing this treatment

The error occurs during model checks when Django tries to check for field name clashes, and it needs to hash field objects including the `ManyToManyRel` objects.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py
```

The main file that needs to be modified is `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py` since that's where the `__hash__` method causing the error is defined. This file would contain the `ManyToManyRel` class that needs the `make_hashable` call added to the `through_fields` attribute.

The `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file is also relevant as it likely contains the definition of the `ManyToManyRel` class and potentially the `make_hashable` function that needs to be applied to the `through_fields` attribute.
