Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- ValidationErrors with identical messages don't equal each other when compared
- This makes testing more difficult since identical validation errors should logically be considered equal

2. Cause Analysis:
- ValidationError class (in django.core.exceptions) lacks an __eq__ method for comparing instances
- The comparison should check if the messages are equal, regardless of the order in which errors were raised
- Currently, it likely falls back to default object comparison which compares object identity rather than content

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/core/exceptions.py
django/forms/utils.py
django/core/checks/messages.py
django/db/migrations/exceptions.py
django/template/exceptions.py
```

Rationale for file selection:
- django/core/exceptions.py: Contains the ValidationError class that needs modification
- django/forms/utils.py: Contains ErrorDict and ErrorList classes that handle form validation errors
- django/core/checks/messages.py: Contains base message handling for validation and checks
- django/db/migrations/exceptions.py: Contains related validation error handling for migrations
- django/template/exceptions.py: Contains template-related validation error handling

The primary fix would need to be implemented in django/core/exceptions.py by adding an __eq__ method to the ValidationError class.
