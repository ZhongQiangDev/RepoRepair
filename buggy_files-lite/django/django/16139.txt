Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When accessing UserAdmin through another model's Admin that uses `to_field="uuid"`, the link to the PasswordResetForm becomes broken (404)
- The URL pattern becomes `.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid`
- The password reset link is incorrectly formatted as `../password/` instead of considering the actual path structure

2. Cause Analysis:
- The UserChangeForm hardcodes the password reset link format to `../password/`
- This assumes UserAdmin is always accessed via primary key
- When accessed through UUID or other fields, the relative path becomes incorrect
- The fix requires using the actual instance's primary key in the path: `../../{self.instance.pk}/password/`

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/contrib/auth/forms.py
django/contrib/auth/admin.py
django/contrib/admin/options.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `auth/forms.py` contains the UserChangeForm with the hardcoded password reset link path
- `auth/admin.py` contains the UserAdmin class that uses the UserChangeForm
- `admin/options.py` contains the base ModelAdmin class that handles URL generation and field references

The core issue lies in `auth/forms.py` where the password reset link is hardcoded, while the other files provide the context and infrastructure where this issue manifests.
