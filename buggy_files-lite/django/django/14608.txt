Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Forms add the `nonfield` CSS class for non-field errors in ErrorList instances
- However, FormSets do not add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors
- This inconsistency makes it difficult for custom ErrorList to distinguish between form field errors, non-field errors (forms), and non-form errors (FormSets)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from inconsistent error class handling between Forms and FormSets
- While Forms properly add CSS classes for different error types, FormSets lack the parallel implementation for non-form errors
- This is likely an oversight in the FormSet error handling implementation
- The fix would require adding similar CSS class logic in the FormSet-related code

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):

```
django/forms/formsets.py
django/forms/forms.py
django/forms/utils.py
django/forms/models.py
django/core/exceptions.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- formsets.py: Contains the core FormSet implementation where the non-form error class needs to be added
- forms.py: Contains the Form implementation that already has the working nonfield CSS class implementation
- utils.py: Contains error handling utilities used by both Forms and FormSets
- models.py: Contains model form implementations that may need parallel changes
- exceptions.py: Contains base exception handling that may need to be considered for consistency
