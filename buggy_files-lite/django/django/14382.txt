Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using bash tab-completion, directory names get a trailing slash appended
- Running `django-admin startapp name directory/` results in an error claiming the directory is not valid
- The error message states: "'' is not a valid app directory"

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs in django/core/management/templates.py line 77
- The code calls `os.path.basename()` on the target path without handling trailing slashes
- When a path ends with a slash, `basename()` returns an empty string
- This empty string is then passed to `validate_name()` which fails validation
- The fix would be to strip trailing slashes before calling `basename()`

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/core/management/templates.py
django/core/management/commands/startapp.py
django/core/management/base.py
django/core/management/utils.py
django/core/checks/urls.py
```

Rationale for file selection:
- templates.py is the primary file containing the bug in the template command base class
- startapp.py inherits from TemplateCommand and is where the actual command is implemented
- base.py contains core command functionality that both above files depend on
- utils.py contains helper functions used by the management commands
- checks/urls.py contains URL-related validation that may be relevant for path handling
