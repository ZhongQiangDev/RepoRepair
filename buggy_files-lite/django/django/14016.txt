Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when using the | (OR) operator between Q objects when one contains a dict_keys object. Specifically:
```python
Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())
```
raises "TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object"

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error suggests Django is trying to pickle (serialize) the Q objects when combining them with the OR operator
- The dict_keys object (returned by .keys()) is not pickleable in Python
- This happens because Django needs to serialize Q objects for database queries, but dict_keys cannot be serialized
- The underlying issue is in how Django handles Q object combinations and serialization of query components

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/core/serializers/base.py
django/core/serializers/python.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- query.py contains core query building logic including Q object handling
- sql/query.py handles SQL query construction and parameter processing
- fields/related.py deals with field lookups and queries
- serializers files handle object serialization which is where the pickle error originates
- The pickle error occurs during query construction and serialization, which these files manage
