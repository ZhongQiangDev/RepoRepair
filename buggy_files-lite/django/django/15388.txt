Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- After adding BASE_DIR to TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'] in settings.py, the dev server fails to restart automatically when files are modified
- This affects not just settings.py changes but all file changes that should trigger a restart

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to Django's autoreload mechanism
- When BASE_DIR is added to template directories, it likely causes the file watcher to monitor too many files or enter an invalid state
- The development server uses file system monitoring to detect changes and trigger reloads
- The problem seems to stem from how template directories are handled by the autoreload system

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/utils/autoreload.py
django/template/utils.py
django/core/management/commands/runserver.py
django/template/backends/django.py
django/template/autoreload.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `autoreload.py` contains the core file watching and reloading logic that's malfunctioning
- `template/utils.py` handles template directory configuration and validation
- `runserver.py` manages the development server and integrates with the autoreload system  
- `backends/django.py` processes template directories and could affect how they're monitored
- `template/autoreload.py` contains template-specific autoreload functionality

The root cause is most likely in how the autoreload system handles large directory trees when BASE_DIR is added to template directories, causing it to fail silently or enter an invalid state.
