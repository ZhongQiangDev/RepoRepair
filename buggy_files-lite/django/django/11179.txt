I'll analyze the problem and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The GitHub problem description states that when `delete()` is called on model instances without any dependencies, the primary key (PK) is not being set to `None` after deletion. According to the description, this should happen based on code in `django/db/models/deletion.py` around lines 276-281.

## Analyzing the Cause

When a model instance is deleted in Django, the `delete()` method should not only remove the record from the database but also update the in-memory instance to reflect that it's been deleted. Specifically, for models without dependencies, the primary key field should be set to `None` after deletion to indicate that the instance no longer exists in the database.

Based on the reference to `django/db/models/deletion.py:276-281`, this is likely where the code should be updating the primary key after deletion, but it's not doing so correctly for models without dependencies.

## Files Needing Modification

After analyzing the repository information, here are the files most related to the issue, ordered by importance:

```
django/db/models/deletion.py
django/db/models/base.py
django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py
django/core/management/commands/flush.py
django/db/models/manager.py
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `django/db/models/deletion.py`, which contains the deletion logic mentioned in the issue description. The `base.py` file is also important as it contains the core `Model` class implementation. The other files handle specific deletion scenarios that might be affected by this change.
