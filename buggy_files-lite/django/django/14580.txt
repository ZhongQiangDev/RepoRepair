Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The makemigrations command generates a migration file that references `models.Model` in the bases tuple without importing `models`, causing a NameError when the migration is run.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the migration writer failing to add the necessary import statement for `models` when generating the migration file. While it correctly imports `app.models` for the custom field, it misses importing `models` which is needed because the base class `models.Model` is referenced directly in the `bases` tuple.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/db/migrations/writer.py
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/migrations/loader.py
```

The `writer.py` is most important as it's responsible for generating the migration file content and managing imports. `serializer.py` handles how different Python objects (including model bases) are serialized into the migration file. `makemigrations.py` orchestrates the migration creation process. `autodetector.py` detects model changes and creates migration operations. `loader.py` handles loading and processing migration files.
