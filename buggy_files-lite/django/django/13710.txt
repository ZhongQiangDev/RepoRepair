I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

1. **Wrong Behavior**: In Django admin, when specifying a `verbose_name` for an Inline class, the `verbose_name_plural` is not automatically derived from it. Instead, it continues to use the model's name or the model's Meta class verbose_name.

2. **Cause**: The issue is that Django's admin Inline classes aren't following the same pattern as model Meta classes. In model Meta classes, if you specify a `verbose_name`, the `verbose_name_plural` is automatically derived by adding an 's' (or following language-specific pluralization rules). However, this behavior isn't implemented for admin Inline classes.

3. **Required Fix**: Modify the Inline admin classes to derive the `verbose_name_plural` from the `verbose_name` when only the latter is specified, similar to how it works in model Meta classes.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
django/contrib/admin/options.py
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
django/contrib/admin/checks.py
```

The most important file is `django/contrib/admin/options.py` as it contains the `InlineModelAdmin` class which is the base class for inline admins and likely handles the verbose_name and verbose_name_plural attributes.

The `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` file is also important as it likely contains helper classes for rendering the inline admin forms, which would need to access these verbose names.

The `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` file may contain validation for admin configurations, which might need to be updated if there are any checks related to verbose names in inlines.
