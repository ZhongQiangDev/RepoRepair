Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using QuerySet.Delete() with zero objects to delete, the result format is inconsistent:
  - For models with foreign keys: returns (0, {})
  - For simple models without foreign keys: returns (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})
- The inconsistency lies in the dictionary part of the tuple, where one case includes the model with zero count while the other omits it entirely.

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be related to how Django's deletion collector handles different model types during deletion operations
- The core issue likely stems from how the deletion collector tracks and counts deleted objects differently for models with and without foreign key relationships
- The deletion counter logic in Django's deletion framework treats simple models and related models differently when no objects are found to delete

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/models/deletion.py
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/core/management/commands/sqlsequencereset.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `deletion.py` is most important as it contains the Collector class that handles deletion operations and counting
- `query.py` contains the QuerySet implementation where the delete() method is defined
- `subqueries.py` handles the actual DELETE SQL operations
- `fields/related.py` defines how foreign key relationships are handled
- `sqlsequencereset.py` is related to sequence handling during deletions
