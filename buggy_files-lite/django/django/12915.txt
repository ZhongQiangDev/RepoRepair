Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to use ASGIStaticFilesHandler, resulting in a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable. Specifically, it fails when trying to call get_response_async.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error trace shows that while the ASGIStaticFilesHandler inherits from StaticFilesHandlerMixin, it's missing the get_response_async method which is required for ASGI applications. When the code tries to call this method through super().__call__, it encounters None instead of a callable method, causing the TypeError.

3. Most Related Files:
The files most directly related to this issue, in order of importance, would be:

```
django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py
django/core/handlers/base.py
django/core/handlers/asgi.py
```

These files are the most relevant because:
- handlers.py contains the StaticFilesHandler implementation that needs to be fixed
- base.py contains the base handler implementation with get_response_async
- asgi.py contains the ASGI-specific handler implementation that's trying to use the static files handler

The issue would be fixed by implementing get_response_async in the StaticFilesHandlerMixin or ASGIStaticFilesHandler class within handlers.py, following the pattern established in the base handler classes.
