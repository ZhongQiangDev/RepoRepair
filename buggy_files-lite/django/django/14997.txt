Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When trying to alter a field's max_length (from 200 to 150) in a model that has a unique constraint using F() expressions, SQLite raises an error: "the "." operator prohibited in index expressions"
- This occurs during migration when SQLite tries to remake the table with the unique constraint.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how Django handles unique constraints with F() expressions in SQLite
- The error occurs because SQLite doesn't support using the "." operator in index expressions
- When Django tries to recreate the table with the altered field, it's attempting to create the unique constraint using F() expressions in a way that's incompatible with SQLite's syntax
- The core issue is in how Django's SQLite schema editor handles the recreation of unique constraints during table alterations

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/models/constraints.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. sqlite3/schema.py is most relevant as it handles SQLite-specific schema operations including table recreation and constraint handling
2. migrations/executor.py manages the execution of migrations and would be involved in coordinating the field alteration
3. models/constraints.py defines how constraints are handled and generated
4. operations/models.py contains the operations for altering model fields
5. sqlite3/base.py provides core SQLite functionality and could be involved in how expressions are handled
