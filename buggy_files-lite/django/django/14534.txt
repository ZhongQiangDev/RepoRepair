Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `BoundWidget.id_for_label` ignores the ID that was set through `ChoiceWidget.options`
- Instead of using the ID from `self.data['attrs']['id']`, it reconstructs a new ID using `'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])`
- This causes inconsistency when custom IDs are specified for form widgets

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how `BoundWidget.id_for_label()` handles ID generation
- Even though the widget's attributes contain a properly set ID (available through `self.data['attrs']['id']`), the method ignores it
- Instead, it generates a new ID using a hardcoded format with the field name and index
- This breaks the expected behavior where custom IDs set through widget attributes should be respected

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/forms/boundfield.py
django/forms/widgets.py
django/forms/fields.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
1. `boundfield.py` contains the `BoundWidget` class where the issue exists and needs to be fixed
2. `widgets.py` contains the `ChoiceWidget` and related widget implementations that set the IDs
3. `fields.py` contains form field implementations that work with these widgets and may be affected by the ID handling

I limited to 3 files since the other files in the repository information are less directly related to this specific widget ID handling issue.
