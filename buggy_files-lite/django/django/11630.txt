Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Django 2.2 raises an error when different apps with different models have the same table name
- Error message indicates that table_name is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName
- This breaks existing functionality that worked in Django 2.0 where different apps could have models using the same table names

2. Cause Analysis:
- In Django 2.2, stricter validation was added to check for duplicate table names across different apps
- This is a model validation check (models.E028) that prevents multiple models from using the same table name
- The validation occurs during the app registry and model loading process
- This change affects setups with multiple apps pointing to different databases but sharing table names

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/apps/registry.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/apps/config.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
django/db/utils.py
```

Rationale for file selection:
- `registry.py` is most important as it handles app registration and model validation
- `autodetector.py` is responsible for detecting model changes and conflicts
- `config.py` manages app configurations and model loading
- `migration.py` handles database schema changes and dependencies
- `utils.py` contains database utilities including error handling and connection management

These files are central to Django's model registration, validation, and database management systems where the table name validation occurs.
