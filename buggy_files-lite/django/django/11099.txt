Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Username validators (ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator) are accepting usernames that end with a newline character, which should not be allowed.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The regex pattern `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'` is used to validate usernames
- In Python regex, the `$` anchor matches both the end of string AND before a trailing newline
- This means usernames with trailing newlines pass validation when they shouldn't
- The solution is to use `\Z` instead of `$` as it strictly matches the end of string without allowing newlines

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/contrib/auth/validators.py
django/contrib/auth/forms.py
django/forms/fields.py
django/core/validators.py
django/utils/http.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
1. `validators.py` directly contains the problematic validator classes
2. `auth/forms.py` uses these validators for username validation in forms
3. `forms/fields.py` contains base field implementations that work with validators
4. `core/validators.py` contains base validator classes and patterns
5. `utils/http.py` has URL validation patterns that might need similar consideration

The primary fix would need to be made in `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` where the regex pattern is defined.
