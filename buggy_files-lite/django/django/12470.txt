I'll analyze the problem and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The GitHub problem describes an inheritance issue with model ordering in Django. When a parent model has `ordering = ["-pk"]` in its Meta class, and a child model inherits from it, the child model's query incorrectly uses `ASC` ordering instead of the expected `DESC` ordering that was defined in the parent.

The specific issue is that when querying `Child.objects.all()`, the generated SQL shows:
```sql
ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" ASC
```

But since the parent model defined `ordering = ["-pk"]`, it should be:
```sql
ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" DESC
```

This suggests that somewhere in Django's inheritance handling, the ordering direction is being lost or incorrectly processed when inherited from a parent model.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
django/db/models/base.py
django/db/models/options.py
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
```

The issue is most likely in the inheritance handling of model options (particularly the `ordering` attribute) or in how the SQL compiler translates the ordering specification into an actual SQL query. The `base.py` file contains the core `Model` class and `ModelBase` metaclass which handle inheritance, while `options.py` would contain the `Meta` class processing. The `compiler.py` and `query.py` files handle the translation of model queries into SQL, including ordering clauses.
