Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- JSONField values are displayed incorrectly in Django admin when they are readonly
- The values are shown with Python dict syntax (e.g., {'foo': 'bar'}) instead of valid JSON syntax (e.g., {"foo": "bar"})

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Django admin handles the display of readonly JSONField values
- The display_for_field function in admin utils likely isn't calling the JSONField's prepare_value method
- Instead, it's using the default string representation of Python dictionaries
- This results in single quotes instead of double quotes, making it invalid JSON

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):

```
django/contrib/admin/utils.py
django/contrib/postgres/forms/jsonb.py
django/contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py
django/contrib/admin/options.py
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- admin/utils.py: Contains the display_for_field function that needs modification
- postgres/forms/jsonb.py: Contains JSONField form handling and value preparation
- postgres/fields/jsonb.py: Contains the base JSONField implementation
- admin/options.py: Handles model admin configuration and field display
- admin/helpers.py: Contains helper classes for readonly field display in admin
