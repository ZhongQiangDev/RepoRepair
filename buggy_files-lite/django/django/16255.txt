Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a sitemap contains no items but has a callable lastmod method, it raises a ValueError with message "max() arg is an empty sequence"
- This occurs when trying to get the latest lastmod date from an empty set of items

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error happens in the get_latest_lastmod() method
- When there are no items but lastmod is defined as a callable, it tries to create a list comprehension of lastmod dates and find the maximum
- Since the items list is empty, calling max() on an empty list raises ValueError
- The code needs to handle this edge case by catching ValueError in addition to TypeError

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py
django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py
django/contrib/flatpages/sitemaps.py
```

The first file contains the core sitemap functionality and the get_latest_lastmod() method that needs fixing.

The second file handles sitemap views and calls get_latest_lastmod(), making it directly involved.

The third file provides an example implementation of sitemaps for flatpages that could be affected by this issue.

These files are ordered by importance since the core issue and fix would be in the base sitemaps implementation, followed by the view layer that triggers it, and finally specific implementations that could be impacted.
