Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The MultiWidget class is generating label IDs with a forced '0' index suffix (f'{id_}0')
- This automatic index addition doesn't make sense for all use cases
- Some widgets like ChoiceWidget have control over index addition through self.add_id_index

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the MultiWidget class's id_for_label method
- It's automatically appending an index without giving subclasses control over this behavior
- This affects label generation and form field associations
- The behavior should be more flexible, allowing subclasses to determine if/how indices are added

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/forms/widgets.py
django/forms/fields.py
django/forms/boundfield.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- widgets.py contains the MultiWidget class implementation and core widget functionality
- fields.py contains field classes that use MultiWidget
- boundfield.py handles the binding between fields and widgets, including label generation

The issue primarily lives in widgets.py where the MultiWidget class is defined, with the other files being involved in how widgets interact with fields and labels in the form system.
