Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `Subquery.as_sql()` method generates invalid SQL by incorrectly removing the first and last symbols from the SQL string
- Specifically, it removes 'S' from 'SELECT' at the start and '"' at the end
- This results in invalid SQL like: `(ELECT "apps_app"."id", "apps_app"."name" FROM "apps_app"` instead of `(SELECT "apps_app"."id", "apps_app"."name" FROM "apps_app")`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the `subquery` attribute not being set properly in the Subquery constructor
- Setting `Subquery().query.subquery = True` fixes the problem
- This suggests the constructor should automatically set this attribute to ensure proper SQL generation
- The problem likely lies in the query compilation and SQL generation logic for subqueries

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/models/expressions.py
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/sql/where.py
django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. expressions.py contains the Subquery class implementation
2. compiler.py handles SQL generation and compilation
3. query.py manages core query building including subqueries
4. where.py handles subquery constraints and SQL WHERE clauses
5. datastructures.py provides base structures for SQL query components
