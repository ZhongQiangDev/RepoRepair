I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the most relevant files to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is with `TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback = True`, which is meant to restore the database to its pre-test state after each test. The problem occurs during the restoration process when objects are being deserialized and saved back to the database.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The root cause is that `deserialize_db_from_string` in `BaseDatabaseCreation` does not wrap the object saving process in a transaction. This can lead to integrity errors when an object with a foreign key is saved before the object it references. 

The issue is specifically that:
1. `serialize_db_to_string` orders models using `serializers.sort_dependencies`, but this only handles natural keys, not foreign key dependencies
2. `deserialize_db_from_string` doesn't wrap the saving in a transaction, unlike Django's `loaddata` command which does use a transaction

## 3. Most Relevant Files

```
django/db/backends/base/creation.py
django/core/serializers/base.py
django/db/transaction.py
django/db/backends/base/base.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` since it contains the `deserialize_db_from_string` method that needs to be wrapped in a transaction. The other files provide context on how serialization, transactions, and database operations work together in Django.
