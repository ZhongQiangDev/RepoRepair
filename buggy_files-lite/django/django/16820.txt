Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem involves deprecation warnings that persist even after squashing migrations when transitioning from Meta.index_together to Meta.indexes. These warnings shouldn't appear after properly squashing migrations with the transition.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely stems from how the migration squashing process handles the transition between the deprecated `index_together` option and the newer `indexes` option. When migrations are squashed, the system should recognize this transition and update the model metadata accordingly to use the new format, eliminating deprecation warnings. The fact that warnings persist suggests the squashing process isn't properly converting these index definitions during optimization.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
```

Reasoning:
- `optimizer.py` is most critical as it handles the optimization of migrations during squashing
- `operations/models.py` contains the operations for handling model changes including index operations
- `squashmigrations.py` is the command that orchestrates the squashing process
- `autodetector.py` handles detection of changes between states
- `migration.py` provides the base migration functionality

These files would need to be modified to properly handle the transition from index_together to indexes during the squashing process.
