Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When formatting numbers in the admin list_display, if a number field is null, accessing str_number[0] causes an IndexError: string index out of range
- This happens specifically when checking if the first character is a negative sign (str_number[0] == "-")

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in number formatting when handling null values
- The code tries to check for a negative sign by accessing the first character of the string representation
- When the value is null, the string representation is empty, so accessing index [0] raises an IndexError
- This appears to be in the number formatting utility that handles negative numbers and formatting for admin display

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
django/utils/numberformat.py
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
django/utils/formats.py
django/contrib/admin/exceptions.py
django/template/response.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- numberformat.py is most relevant as it contains the core number formatting logic that handles negative numbers
- admin/helpers.py handles admin interface display formatting
- formats.py contains localization and formatting utilities that may interact with number formatting
- admin/exceptions.py would handle admin-related errors
- template/response.py handles template rendering where the formatting occurs

The issue likely needs to be fixed in numberformat.py by adding a null check before attempting to access the first character of the string.
