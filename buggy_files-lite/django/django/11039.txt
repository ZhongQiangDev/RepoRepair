Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The sqlmigrate command is wrapping SQL output in BEGIN/COMMIT statements even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The sqlmigrate command only checks migration.atomic to decide whether to add BEGIN/COMMIT
- It should also check connection.features.can_rollback_ddl before adding transaction statements
- The logic needs to consider both conditions: migration being atomic AND database supporting DDL rollback

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/transaction.py
```

Reasoning:
- sqlmigrate.py is the main file containing the command implementation that needs to be modified
- executor.py contains the MigrationExecutor class that handles migration execution and SQL generation
- transaction.py contains core transaction handling logic that affects how BEGIN/COMMIT statements are managed

These files are most directly involved in the transaction wrapping behavior during SQL migration generation.
