Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The FileBasedCache's has_key method can raise a FileNotFoundError when checking if a key exists in the cache, even though it first checks for file existence using os.path.exists().

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue is a race condition in the has_key method where:
- First it checks if the file exists using os.path.exists()
- Then it tries to open and read the file
- Between these two operations, another thread could delete the file (especially if the file is expired and _is_expired() deletes it)
- This leads to FileNotFoundError when trying to open a file that was just deleted

3. Most Related Files:
The key files involved in this issue are:

```
django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py
django/core/cache/backends/base.py
django/core/cache/backends/locmem.py
```

I selected these files because:
- filebased.py contains the actual buggy code and needs to be fixed directly
- base.py defines the base cache interface that filebased.py implements
- locmem.py provides an example of proper thread-safe cache implementation that could be referenced for fixing the race condition

The issue is primarily in the file-based cache implementation, so other files are less relevant to fixing this specific bug.
