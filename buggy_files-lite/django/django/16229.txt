Let me help analyze this issue:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When submitting a form with an ArrayField in an inline admin form:
  * First submission shows validation error correctly
  * Second submission bypasses validation and clears the field value incorrectly
  * The hidden input with initial value is not being handled properly

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how Django handles validation and initial values for ArrayField in inline forms
- The hidden input containing the initial value (`initial-relatedmodel_set-0-plop`) is not being processed correctly on subsequent submissions
- This seems to be a problem with the form validation logic in Django's admin interface, specifically around inline formsets and their handling of ArrayField defaults

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
django/contrib/admin/options.py
django/forms/models.py
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
django/forms/boundfield.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. `options.py` contains the core InlineModelAdmin and form handling logic
2. `models.py` handles model form processing and validation
3. `helpers.py` manages inline formset rendering and processing
4. `boundfield.py` handles form field binding and initial values
5. `fields/related.py` contains related field logic that may affect inline processing

The issue likely needs to be fixed primarily in the inline formset handling code within these files, particularly around how initial values are processed during validation.
