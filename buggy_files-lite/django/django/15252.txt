Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The MigrationRecorder tries to create django_migrations table in all database connections during test database setup
- This happens even when the db_router's allow_migrate explicitly returns False for non-default databases
- This violates the router rules that should prevent migrations/table creation in non-default databases

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from MigrationRecorder's ensure_schema() method which creates the django_migrations table
- This method is called during migration recording but doesn't respect the database router's allow_migrate rules
- The recorder directly creates tables without checking if migrations are allowed on that database connection
- This bypasses the router's control over which databases should have migration tables created

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/migrations/recorder.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/utils.py
django/db/backends/base/creation.py
django/core/management/commands/migrate.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- recorder.py contains the MigrationRecorder class that's directly responsible for the issue
- executor.py handles migration execution and calls the recorder
- utils.py contains the router functionality being bypassed
- creation.py handles test database creation where the issue manifests
- migrate.py is the command that triggers the migration process
