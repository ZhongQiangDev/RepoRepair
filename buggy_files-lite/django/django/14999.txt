Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using RenameModel operation with a model that already has db_table defined, it's not being treated as a no-operation
- In Postgres, it unnecessarily drops and recreates foreign key constraints
- In SQLite, it unnecessarily recreates the table

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how RenameModel operation handles models with explicit db_table settings
- When a model already specifies its db_table, renaming the model shouldn't affect the actual database table name
- However, the current implementation is still performing table operations even when they're not needed
- The core issue lies in the migration operation detection and execution logic, particularly in how it handles model renames when db_table is explicitly set

3. Most relevant files (ordered by importance):

```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py
django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `operations/models.py` contains the RenameModel operation implementation which needs to be fixed
- `autodetector.py` handles detecting and generating migration operations
- `postgresql/schema.py` and `sqlite3/schema.py` contain the backend-specific implementations causing the unnecessary table operations
- `executor.py` handles the execution of migrations and could help optimize the operation handling
