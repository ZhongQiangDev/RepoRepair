Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When passing a memoryview object to HttpResponse, it returns the string representation of the memoryview object (`b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'`) instead of the actual content (`b'My Content'`).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how HttpResponse handles memoryview objects when setting response.content. While it correctly handles strings and bytes, it fails to properly extract the actual content from memoryview objects, instead using their string representation. This is likely because the content handling code in HttpResponse doesn't have specific handling for memoryview objects.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/http/response.py
django/core/files/base.py
django/http/request.py
django/middleware/gzip.py
django/core/handlers/wsgi.py
```

Reasoning:
- django/http/response.py is most important as it contains the HttpResponse class and content handling logic
- django/core/files/base.py handles file-like objects and content types
- django/http/request.py contains related request handling code
- django/middleware/gzip.py deals with content encoding/compression
- django/core/handlers/wsgi.py handles low-level WSGI response processing

The fix would likely need to be implemented in django/http/response.py to properly handle memoryview objects when setting response content.
