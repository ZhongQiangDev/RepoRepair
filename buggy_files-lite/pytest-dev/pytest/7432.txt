Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `@pytest.mark.skip`, the skip location reporting is incorrect when `--runxfail` flag is used
- Instead of showing the actual test location (test_it.py:3), it shows an internal pytest location (src/_pytest/skipping.py:238)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`
- The `--runxfail` flag is interfering with skip location reporting, even though it should only affect xfail tests
- Based on the hint, the bug is specifically in the skipping module's report generation logic

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/_pytest/skipping.py
testing/python/collect.py
testing/python/integration.py
```

I've listed these files in order of importance because:
1. `src/_pytest/skipping.py` is directly mentioned in the bug report and contains the actual bug
2. `testing/python/collect.py` contains test collection and reporting logic tests
3. `testing/python/integration.py` includes integration tests that might be relevant for skip marking behavior

I excluded `testing/python/metafunc.py` as it appears to focus more on parametrization and fixture functionality rather than test skipping behavior.
