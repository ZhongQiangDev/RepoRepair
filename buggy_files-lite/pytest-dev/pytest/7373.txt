Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running two test modules with the same skipif condition string "skip" but different global variable values, both tests are being skipped when only one should be.
- Specifically, test_module_2.py should NOT be skipped since its global 'skip' variable is False.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from pytest caching the evaluation of skipif condition strings
- The cache key only considers the condition string itself ("skip" in this case)
- It doesn't take into account that the same string needs to be evaluated in different global contexts
- This causes the first evaluation result to be incorrectly reused for subsequent evaluations

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files:

```
testing/python/collect.py
testing/python/metafunc.py
testing/python/raises.py
```

I selected these files because:
- collect.py contains TestFunction class which handles test function behavior including markers like skipif
- metafunc.py deals with test parametrization and markers
- raises.py includes test condition evaluation logic

Note: The actual file containing the caching logic (_pytest/mark/evaluate.py) wasn't included in the repository information provided, but would be the primary file needing modification.
