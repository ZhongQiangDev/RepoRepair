Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The assertion rewriting message for byte strings is showing confusing output by displaying ASCII ordinal numbers (like 52 for '4' and 49 for '1') in the error message instead of the actual characters, making it harder for users to understand the difference between expected and actual values.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism when handling byte strings (b""). Instead of showing a clear difference between byte strings, it's showing the ASCII ordinal value of the first different byte, which is not user-friendly. This is likely happening in the assertion comparison and formatting code.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
testing/python/raises.py
testing/python/collect.py
```

I'm listing these files because:
- `testing/python/raises.py` is most relevant as it contains the TestRaises class which handles assertion testing and exception handling, which is directly related to how assertions are processed and displayed
- `testing/python/collect.py` might be involved as it handles test collection and execution, which could affect how assertions are processed

Note: The actual fix might require changes to files not shown in the provided repository information, particularly those handling assertion rewriting and comparison formatting. The complete fix would likely need access to pytest's assertion rewriting core files.
