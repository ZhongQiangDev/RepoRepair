Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is with pytest's reporting of `all()`/`any()` assertions. When these built-in functions are used with generators or list comprehensions, the failure messages are not helpful for debugging because they either show:
- A generator object reference (for generator expressions)
- A truncated list of results (for list comprehensions)
Neither provides the specific value that caused the assertion to fail, unlike the more verbose but clearer for-loop approach.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism. When handling `all()`/`any()` calls, it's not "unrolling" the iterable to show which specific element caused the assertion to fail. Instead, it's just showing the result of the entire operation, losing the context of which specific value caused the failure.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant file would be:

```
testing/python/approx.py
```

I can only confidently suggest this one file because:
1. It's directly related to assertion handling and testing functionality
2. It contains test runner customization code (MyDocTestRunner) which deals with test failure reporting
3. It includes comprehensive test cases dealing with various assertion scenarios

While there might be other files involved in fixing this issue, from the repository information provided, I can only see this file as being clearly relevant to assertion handling and test result reporting. The other file (collect.py) seems more focused on test collection and organization rather than assertion behavior.
