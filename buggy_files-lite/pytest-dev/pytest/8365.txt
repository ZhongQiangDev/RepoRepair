Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When creating temporary directories using pytest's `tmpdir`, `tmpdir_factory`, or `tmp_path_factory`, the creation fails if the username contains characters that are illegal for directory names
- Specifically, when the username contains backslash (e.g., 'contoso\john_doe'), the directory creation fails with FileNotFoundError

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from `getpass.getuser()` returning a domain username format (e.g., 'contoso\john_doe') when logged in through SSH on Windows
- This username is used directly in path creation without sanitizing illegal characters
- The backslash in the username is interpreted as a path separator, causing the system to look for a non-existent path

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, there are limited files shown that would be directly related to this issue. The files shown (`testing/python/collect.py` and `testing/python/raises.py`) are mainly about test collection and exception handling, not temporary directory creation.

However, if I were to identify the most likely files that would need to be modified (even though they're not in the provided repository information), they would be:

```
_pytest/tmpdir.py
_pytest/pathlib.py
```

Note: The actual fix would likely need to be in the temporary directory creation logic files, which aren't shown in the provided repository information. The files listed above are my best guess at where the fix would need to be implemented, as they would typically handle temporary directory creation in pytest.
