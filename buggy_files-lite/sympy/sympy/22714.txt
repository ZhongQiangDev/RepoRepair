Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `with evaluate(False)`, `sp.S('Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))')` raises a ValueError saying "Imaginary coordinates are not permitted"
- However, it works fine without `evaluate(False)` or when using `evaluate=False` directly in `sp.S()`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in `sympy/geometry/point.py` during point creation
- The issue seems related to how the sympification process (`sp.S()`) interacts with evaluation control
- When using `with evaluate(False)`, something in the sympification process incorrectly interprets the coordinates as imaginary numbers
- The problem appears to be in the interaction between sympification, evaluation control, and point coordinate validation

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/geometry/point.py
sympy/core/evaluate.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/evalf.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `sympify.py` contains the core sympification logic that's failing
- `point.py` contains the Point2D implementation where the error is raised
- `evaluate.py` would contain the evaluation control context manager
- `expr.py` contains base expression handling that both sympify and points rely on
- `evalf.py` handles numerical evaluation which may affect how coordinates are processed
