Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `itermonomials` is not returning all monomials with total degree equal to min_degrees
- For example, with 3 variables and min_degrees=max_degrees=3, it only returns [x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]
- It should also return mixed terms like x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc. that have total degree 3

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the implementation of `itermonomials` function where it's not properly handling the min_degrees constraint
- When min_degrees equals max_degrees, it's only generating pure power terms (single variable raised to power) instead of all possible combinations that sum to that degree
- This is likely a logic error in the monomial generation algorithm in the core polynomial handling code

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/polys/monomials.py
sympy/polys/polytools.py
sympy/polys/orderings.py
```

I selected these files because:
- `monomials.py` contains the direct implementation of `itermonomials` function which has the bug
- `polytools.py` contains core polynomial manipulation tools that may interact with monomial generation
- `orderings.py` handles monomial ordering which is relevant to how monomials are generated and sorted

The issue is most likely in the `itermonomials` function within `monomials.py`, so this would be the primary file to fix.
