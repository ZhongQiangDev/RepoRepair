Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The inconsistency appears when simplifying (-a)**x * a**(-x) where a is a positive integer. When a is defined as a symbolic positive integer vs when a is defined as a specific positive integer (2), the numerical evaluation gives different results for x = -10/3:
- With symbolic a: -0.5 + 0.866025403784439*I
- With a=2: 0.5 - 0.866025403784439*I (opposite sign)

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how SymPy handles the simplification of (-a)**x * a**(-x) to (-1)**x. The problem likely stems from:
- Branch cut handling in complex exponentials
- Simplification rules for negative bases raised to fractional powers
- Treatment of symbolic vs concrete negative numbers in power expressions

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/simplify/simplify.py
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/core/exprtools.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- simplify.py contains the core simplification logic
- complexes.py handles complex number operations and branch cuts
- exponential.py deals with exponential expressions and power operations
- numbers.py handles numeric evaluations and conversions
- exprtools.py provides tools for expression manipulation
