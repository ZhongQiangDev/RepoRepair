Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is with incorrect matrix element access in a BlockMatrix. When accessing C[i,0] where C is a BlockMatrix composed of matrices A (1x1) and B (nx1), it incorrectly returns (A)[i,0] instead of properly determining whether the element should come from A or B based on the index i.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in the matrix element access implementation for BlockMatrix. When accessing an element using an index i, the code is not properly determining which submatrix (A or B) should be accessed based on the value of i. Instead, it's defaulting to accessing matrix A regardless of the index value.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/slice.py
```

The `blockmatrix.py` file is most important as it contains the BlockMatrix implementation and element access logic. The `matexpr.py` file is relevant as it provides the base matrix expression functionality that BlockMatrix builds upon. The `slice.py` file is included as it handles matrix indexing and slicing operations which are related to element access.
