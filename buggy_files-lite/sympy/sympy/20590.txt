Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- In SymPy 1.6.2, Symbol instances had no `__dict__` attribute and only had `__slots__ = ('name',)`
- In SymPy 1.7, Symbol instances unexpectedly gained a `__dict__` attribute (returning an empty dict) while still having `__slots__`

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a regression where the Symbol class or one of its parent classes accidentally lost proper `__slots__` definition
- When a class uses `__slots__`, it prevents instance dictionary creation, which is more memory efficient
- The presence of `__dict__` suggests that somewhere in the inheritance chain, the slots-only behavior was broken
- Based on the repository files, this likely involves core symbol implementation and class inheritance structure

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/core/symbol.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/core/singleton.py
sympy/core/core.py
sympy/core/decorators.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- `symbol.py` contains the Symbol class implementation which is directly affected
- `basic.py` contains the base class that Symbol inherits from
- `singleton.py` handles class registration and metaclass behavior
- `core.py` contains core metaclass definitions that affect class creation
- `decorators.py` contains class decorators that might affect class attributes
