Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `0**-oo` evaluates to `0` in SymPy 1.5.1
- According to documentation, it should evaluate to `zoo` (ComplexInfinity)
- The documentation states this is because 0**oo may oscillate between positive and negative values or rotate in the complex plane

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with power evaluation when dealing with zero base and infinite exponent
- The problem likely lies in the power evaluation logic in the core power handling classes
- Since this involves special values (0 and infinity) and complex analysis, it requires proper handling in the power evaluation implementation

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/core/power.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
sympy/core/mul.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- power.py: Contains the Pow class which handles power operations and evaluations
- numbers.py: Defines special numbers including infinity and complex infinity (zoo)
- expr.py: Base class for expressions including evaluation rules
- complexes.py: Handles complex number operations and special complex values
- mul.py: Handles multiplication which is related to power operations

The most critical file would be power.py as it directly handles the power evaluation logic that needs to be fixed.
