Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When using autowrap with cython backend, if a matrix argument doesn't appear in the wrapped expression, the generated C function incorrectly treats the matrix argument as a scalar instead of a pointer/array. This causes a TypeError when trying to convert numpy arrays to Python scalars.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue occurs in the code generation phase where matrix/array arguments that don't directly appear in the expression are not properly handled in the generated C function signature. Even though the input is a matrix/array type, the generated code treats it as a scalar double, leading to the type conversion error.

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/utilities/autowrap.py
sympy/utilities/codegen.py
sympy/printing/ccode.py
sympy/printing/codeprinter.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:

1. `autowrap.py` is the main file handling the autowrap functionality and coordinates the code generation process
2. `codegen.py` handles the actual code generation for different languages including C
3. `ccode.py` specifically handles C code printing and type conversions
4. `codeprinter.py` provides the base functionality for code printing that ccode.py extends
5. `matexpr.py` defines matrix expression handling that affects how matrices are processed in code generation

The core issue likely needs to be fixed in either autowrap.py or codegen.py to properly handle matrix arguments regardless of whether they appear in the final expression.
