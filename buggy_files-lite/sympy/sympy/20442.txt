Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `convert_to` function is producing unexpected results when converting between units. Specifically, when converting `joule*second` to `joule`, it returns `joule**(7/9)` instead of returning the original expression or giving an error. This is incorrect because you cannot convert between dimensionally incompatible units (joule*second cannot be expressed in terms of just joules).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the unit conversion system's handling of compound units. The system is attempting to perform a mathematical conversion between incompatible units instead of either:
- Preserving the original expression
- Converting to base units
- Raising an error for incompatible units
The fact that it returns `joule**(7/9)` suggests the conversion algorithm is trying to force a mathematical relationship between dimensionally incompatible quantities.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
sympy/core/evalf.py
```

These files are selected because:
- `expr.py` contains the core expression handling and likely contains the base conversion logic
- `numbers.py` handles numerical operations and power expressions which are involved in the incorrect conversion
- `sympify.py` handles conversion of expressions which may affect unit conversions
- `trigsimp.py` contains simplification logic that might be incorrectly simplifying the unit expressions
- `evalf.py` handles evaluation of expressions which could be affecting how the conversion is processed

The issue likely needs to be fixed primarily in the expression handling and number processing components to properly handle dimensional analysis during unit conversions.
