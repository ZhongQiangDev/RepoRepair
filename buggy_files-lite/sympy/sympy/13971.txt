Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `sp.SeqFormula(n**2, (n,0,sp.oo))` generates output with backslash-escaped brackets: `\left\[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots\right\]`
- When this output is copied to a markdown cell, it doesn't render properly
- The unescaped version `[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots ]` renders correctly

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a printing/rendering issue with `SeqFormula` class
- The sequence is being formatted with LaTeX-style escaping (`\left\[` and `\right\]`) which works in Jupyter's math mode but not in markdown
- The core issue likely lies in how sequences are converted to strings and LaTeX representations

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/series/sequences.py
sympy/printing/latex.py
sympy/printing/str.py
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/interactive/printing.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `sequences.py` contains the `SeqFormula` class implementation
2. `latex.py` handles LaTeX formatting which is causing the escaped brackets
3. `str.py` provides string representation which could be used as alternative
4. `pretty/pretty.py` handles pretty printing which could affect sequence display
5. `interactive/printing.py` manages interactive display settings in environments like Jupyter
