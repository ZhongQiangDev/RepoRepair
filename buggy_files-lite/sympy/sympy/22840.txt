Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves incorrect behavior in the cse() function when handling MatrixSymbol indexing. Specifically, the code is creating unnecessary intermediate variables (x0, x2) that are just copies of the original matrices (a, b), leading to redundant assignments in the generated C code.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how CSE (Common Subexpression Elimination) handles MatrixSymbol indexing operations. Instead of directly accessing matrix elements, it's creating temporary variables to store the entire matrices first, then accessing elements from these temporaries. This creates inefficient code with redundant assignments.

3. Most Related Files:
The files most relevant to fixing this issue would be those handling CSE operations and matrix expressions, particularly focusing on MatrixSymbol handling and code generation. Based on the repository information provided:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/printing/codeprinter.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/slice.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- matexpr.py contains the core MatrixSymbol class and matrix expression handling
- expr.py contains the base expression handling that affects how CSE processes expressions
- codeprinter.py handles the generation of code output
- matmul.py handles matrix multiplication which is central to the example
- slice.py handles matrix indexing operations which are part of the issue
