Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `trigsimp` incorrectly simplifies `cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2)` as though it were `cos(x)+sin(x)`
- This is incorrect for complex x, though it works correctly for real x
- The issue appears to be with handling the square root of squared trigonometric functions in complex domains

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue seems to be that `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is being oversimplified to `sin(x)` without considering the complex domain
- This simplification is only valid for real x where `sqrt(sin(x)**2) = |sin(x)|`
- In complex analysis, `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is not necessarily equal to `sin(x)` due to branch cuts and the multi-valued nature of complex square roots
- The issue likely lies in the interaction between trigonometric simplification and complex function handling

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
sympy/simplify/fu.py
sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `trigsimp.py` contains the main trigonometric simplification logic where the incorrect behavior occurs
- `complexes.py` handles complex number operations and branch cuts which are central to this issue
- `fu.py` contains additional trigonometric simplification algorithms that may be involved
- `sqrtdenest.py` handles square root simplification which is relevant to the `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` term
- `trigonometric.py` defines the basic trigonometric function behaviors
