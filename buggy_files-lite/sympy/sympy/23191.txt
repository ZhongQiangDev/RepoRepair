Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The output shows unit vectors (i_C, k_C) being inserted in awkward positions within the expressions, breaking the visual alignment and readability of the pretty-printed output in the terminal.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how SymPy's pretty printing system handles vector objects, specifically the placement of unit vectors (i_C, k_C) in the output. The pretty printer is not properly handling the layout of vector expressions when combined with other mathematical notations like fractions, integrals, and trigonometric functions.

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):
```
sympy/physics/vector/printing.py
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/printing/str.py
sympy/interactive/printing.py
sympy/interactive/session.py
```

These files are selected because:
- `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` is the most relevant as it specifically handles vector printing customization
- `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains the core pretty printing logic that needs to handle vector display
- `sympy/printing/str.py` provides base string representation functionality
- `sympy/interactive/printing.py` handles interactive display settings
- `sympy/interactive/session.py` manages the interactive session where the display occurs

The fix would likely need to focus on modifying the vector printing handlers in these files to better handle the placement and alignment of unit vectors in pretty-printed output.
