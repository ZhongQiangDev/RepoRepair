Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to evaluate the dimensionality of an exponential expression containing physical units. The expression `100 + exp(expr)` raises a ValueError indicating that the dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is incorrectly calculated as Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)) when it should be dimensionless (Dimension(1)).

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue lies in how the SI system handles dimensionality checks for exponential functions. When taking the exponential of a quantity, the result should always be dimensionless regardless of the input's dimensions. The `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` method in the SI class is not properly handling this case, failing to recognize that exponential functions should yield dimensionless results.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the problem, here are the most relevant files:

```
sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/function.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. The SI class and dimension calculation is directly involved in the error
2. The exponential function handling is central to the issue
3. Core expression handling affects how dimensions are processed
4. Function base class affects how special functions like exp are evaluated
5. Sympification affects how expressions are processed and validated
