Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to print the shear force of a beam using `b2.shear_force()`. The error message indicates that `_print_SingularityFunction()` received an unexpected keyword argument 'exp'.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests there's a mismatch in how the singularity function is being printed. The LaTeX printer is trying to pass an 'exp' argument to `_print_SingularityFunction()`, but this method doesn't accept that parameter. This appears to be related to how power expressions containing SingularityFunctions are handled during LaTeX printing.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and error trace, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/printing/latex.py
sympy/core/power.py
sympy/integrals/singularityfunctions.py
sympy/core/function.py
sympy/printing/printer.py
```

Reasoning:
- `latex.py` is most important as it contains the LaTeX printing logic that's triggering the error
- `power.py` is relevant as the error occurs during power expression printing
- `singularityfunctions.py` would contain the SingularityFunction implementation
- `function.py` contains base function handling that affects how special functions are printed
- `printer.py` provides the base printing infrastructure

The issue likely needs to be fixed in the LaTeX printer's handling of SingularityFunctions within power expressions.
