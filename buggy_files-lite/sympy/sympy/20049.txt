Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `Point.vel()` method fails to automatically calculate velocity when the position is defined using `set_pos()`, even though similar functionality works for angular velocity with `ReferenceFrame.ang_vel_in()` after defining orientation.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the `Point` class not implementing automatic velocity calculation from position information. While the angular velocity calculation is implemented for reference frames, the analogous functionality for linear velocity of points is missing. This means the velocity needs to be explicitly set rather than being derived from the position's time derivative.

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
sympy/physics/vector/point.py
sympy/physics/mechanics/particle.py
sympy/physics/vector/frame.py
sympy/physics/mechanics/functions.py
sympy/physics/vector/vector.py
```

The `point.py` file is most critical as it contains the core `Point` class implementation. `particle.py` is next as it extends point functionality for particles. `frame.py` is relevant as it shows how similar automatic calculation is implemented for angular velocities. `functions.py` contains time derivative calculations needed for velocity computation. `vector.py` provides the underlying vector operations needed for these calculations.
