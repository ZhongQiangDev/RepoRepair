Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when creating a Derivative object for a MatrixSymbol, its `kind` attribute returns `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` like the Integral object.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in how the `kind` attribute is propagated through derivative operations for matrix objects. While the Integral object correctly preserves the matrix kind information, the Derivative object fails to maintain this type information, defaulting to `UndefinedKind`. This suggests an issue in either the derivative implementation for matrices or the kind inheritance system.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/core/function.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
sympy/core/kind.py
```

The `function.py` is most important as it contains the Derivative implementation. `matexpr.py` handles matrix expressions and their properties. `basic.py` contains core functionality including kind propagation. `matrices.py` provides matrix operations and properties. `core/kind.py` would contain the kind system implementation, though it wasn't in the provided files but would be relevant.

These files would need to be modified to ensure proper kind propagation through derivative operations for matrix objects.
