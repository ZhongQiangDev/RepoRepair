Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Python code printer in SymPy 1.10 is not properly handling tuples with a single element. Specifically, when using `lambdify` to generate code for `tuple([1])`, it outputs `(1)` instead of `(1,)`, which in Python evaluates to just the integer 1 rather than a single-element tuple.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the code generation/printing system where it fails to add the required trailing comma for single-element tuples. This is a critical Python syntax requirement - without the comma, Python interprets `(1)` as just a parenthesized expression rather than a tuple.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/utilities/lambdify.py
sympy/printing/str.py
sympy/core/containers.py
sympy/printing/repr.py
sympy/core/basic.py
```

Reasoning:
- `lambdify.py` is most important as it's directly responsible for generating the Python code from SymPy expressions
- `str.py` and `repr.py` handle string representations of SymPy objects
- `containers.py` defines the Tuple class and its behavior
- `basic.py` provides core functionality that these other components build upon

The fix would likely need to be implemented in `lambdify.py` or the printing system to ensure proper handling of single-element tuples during code generation.
