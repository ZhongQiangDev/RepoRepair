Let me help analyze this problem step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The diophantine() function gives different results for the same equation when the order of symbols (m,n) vs (n,m) is changed, despite having permute=True. With (m,n), it returns 8 solutions, but with (n,m) it only returns 1 solution. This is inconsistent since permute=True should handle all permutations regardless of symbol order.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the handling of symbol permutations in the diophantine solver. When permute=True, the solver should consider all permutations of variables regardless of their initial order. The different results suggest that the permutation handling is not working correctly, likely due to how the equation is processed and how solutions are generated based on the variable ordering.

```
sympy/solvers/diophantine.py
sympy/polys/polytools.py
sympy/polys/polyfuncs.py
sympy/core/exprtools.py
sympy/utilities/iterables.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- diophantine.py contains the main diophantine solver implementation and is directly responsible for handling the permute flag
- polytools.py handles polynomial manipulation which is crucial for processing diophantine equations
- polyfuncs.py provides polynomial function utilities that may affect equation processing
- exprtools.py contains expression manipulation tools used in equation processing
- iterables.py provides permutation utilities that could be involved in the permute functionality
