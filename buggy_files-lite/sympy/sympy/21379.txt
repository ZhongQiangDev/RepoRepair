Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `subs()` on an expression containing hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments, a `PolynomialError` is unexpectedly raised
- The error only occurs with real symbols and specific combinations of functions (sinh/cosh/tanh with Piecewise)
- The error disappears after running the same code again without clearing cache

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to assumptions handling and caching during substitution operations
- The error "Piecewise generators do not make sense" suggests the polynomial system is incorrectly trying to process a Piecewise expression
- The fact that it works with non-real symbols and after caching indicates an issue with how real-valued assumptions are being processed during the first evaluation

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/core/assumptions.py
sympy/core/cache.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/core/symbol.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `basic.py` contains the core substitution logic and expression handling
- `assumptions.py` manages the assumption system that's behaving differently for real symbols
- `cache.py` is directly related to the caching behavior that affects the error's occurrence
- `sympify.py` handles type conversions during substitution which could affect how Piecewise expressions are processed
- `symbol.py` defines symbol behavior and their assumptions, which is key to the real/non-real difference
