Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `Intersection({1},{1},{x})` returns `EmptySet()` when it should return `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))`. The intersection is incorrectly evaluating duplicates and not properly handling the symbolic variable x.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how Intersection handles:
- Duplicate sets (e.g. {1},{1})
- Sets containing symbolic variables (e.g. {x})
- The combination of both scenarios

The intersection should:
a) Remove duplicates at instantiation
b) Properly evaluate the remaining sets with symbolic variables
c) Return a piecewise result based on when x equals 1

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/sets/sets.py
sympy/sets/contains.py 
sympy/sets/conditionset.py
sympy/logic/boolalg.py
sympy/sets/fancysets.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sets.py` contains the core Intersection class implementation
- `contains.py` handles set membership evaluation which is crucial for intersection logic
- `conditionset.py` deals with conditional set definitions needed for the piecewise result
- `boolalg.py` provides boolean logic operations used in set operations
- `fancysets.py` includes specialized set implementations that may affect intersection behavior

The fix would likely need to modify the Intersection class implementation in `sets.py` to properly handle duplicate removal and symbolic evaluation.
