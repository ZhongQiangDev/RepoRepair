Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style="full")` outputs `'\\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'` 
- Instead it should output `'\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'`
- The issue is that "acsc" is not being converted to "arccsc" when inv_trig_style="full" is specified

2. Cause Analysis:
- The problem appears to be in the handling of inverse trigonometric function names in LaTeX printing
- The current code only handles asin, acos, atan, acot in the inv_trig_table list
- Missing entries for acsc and asec causes them to fall back to default handling without the "arc" prefix

3. Most relevant files:
```
sympy/printing/latex.py
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
sympy/printing/str.py
```

Reasoning:
- sympy/printing/latex.py is most important as it contains the LaTeX printing logic and the inv_trig_table that needs to be modified
- sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py contains the core trigonometric function definitions and handling
- sympy/printing/str.py provides base printing functionality that LaTeX printing builds upon
