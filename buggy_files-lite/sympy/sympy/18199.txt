Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `nthroot_mod` function fails to include 0 as a root when solving x^n ≡ a mod p where a ≡ 0 mod p
- Specific example: nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17) should include 0 as a root but doesn't

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the modular arithmetic implementation where special case of x = 0 is not being checked when a ≡ 0 mod p
- This is likely in the core modular arithmetic functions, specifically where nth roots are calculated in modular arithmetic

3. Most relevant files (ordered by importance):

```
sympy/ntheory/modular.py
sympy/core/power.py
sympy/polys/galoistools.py
```

I selected these files because:
- `modular.py` is the primary file handling modular arithmetic operations
- `power.py` contains core power/root operations that would interact with modular arithmetic
- `galoistools.py` likely contains supporting functions for finite field arithmetic which is relevant for modular operations

The other files (crypto.py and diophantine.py) are less relevant as they deal with higher-level applications rather than core modular arithmetic functionality.
