Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue appears to be with the `apart()` function giving inconsistent results:
- When applied to `bug.subs(a, 1)`, it correctly gives `-t + 1/2 - 1/(2*(2*t - 1))`
- When applied to `bug` directly, it incorrectly gives `-a*t`, missing the other terms

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem seems to be in the partial fraction decomposition logic when handling symbolic coefficients (like 'a'). The `apart()` function is not properly handling the denominator `(2*t - 1)` when the expression contains symbolic coefficients. This suggests an issue in the core functionality that handles partial fraction decomposition and rational function manipulation.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the problem, here are the most relevant files:

```
sympy/core/mul.py
sympy/core/add.py
sympy/core/power.py
sympy/core/function.py
sympy/simplify/radsimp.py
```

These files are chosen because:
- `mul.py` and `add.py` handle basic arithmetic operations and term manipulation
- `power.py` deals with denominators and fractions
- `function.py` contains core function evaluation logic
- `radsimp.py` includes rational function simplification routines

The issue likely stems from the interaction between these components when handling symbolic coefficients during partial fraction decomposition.
