Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to load a pickled sympy expression containing a float from Python 2 into Python 3. The error occurs specifically when trying to convert a string '1L' to an integer with base 16.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be related to Python 2 vs 3 pickle compatibility issues. In Python 2, long integers were denoted with an 'L' suffix, but this notation was removed in Python 3. When deserializing in Python 3, it encounters the 'L' suffix from Python 2's long integer representation and fails to parse it correctly. This particularly affects sympy's number handling and pickling mechanisms.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the error trace and repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/polys/polyutils.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/core/compatibility.py
sympy/core/evalf.py
```

Reasoning:
- `numbers.py` is most critical as the error occurs in its number handling code
- `polyutils.py` contains `PicklableWithSlots` which is crucial for pickling functionality
- `sympify.py` handles conversion of Python objects to SymPy objects
- `compatibility.py` handles Python 2/3 compatibility issues
- `evalf.py` deals with numerical evaluation and floating-point handling
