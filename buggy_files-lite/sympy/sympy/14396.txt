Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to create a polynomial using `Poly(1.2*x*y*z, x, domain='RR[y,z]')`. The code raises an `OptionError` stating "expected a valid domain specification, got RR[y,z]".

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in domain parsing/validation
- While `Poly(1.2*x*y*z, x)` automatically creates a domain 'RR[y,z]', explicitly specifying this domain fails
- This suggests the domain parsing code doesn't properly handle the construction of polynomial domains over the reals with parameters
- The error originates from options processing in the polynomial construction

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/polys/polyoptions.py
sympy/polys/polytools.py
sympy/polys/domains/domain.py
sympy/polys/domains/compositedomain.py
sympy/polys/domains/polynomialring.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `polyoptions.py` contains the domain option processing code where the error is raised
- `polytools.py` handles polynomial construction and option processing
- `domain.py` defines base domain functionality
- `compositedomain.py` and `polynomialring.py` handle composite domains and polynomial rings which are relevant for domains like 'RR[y,z]'
