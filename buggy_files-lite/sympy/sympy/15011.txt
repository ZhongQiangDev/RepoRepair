Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `lambdify` fails when trying to create a lambda function for a `MatrixSymbol` with curly braces in its name, even with `dummify=True` enabled
- The error occurs specifically when combining curly braces with `MatrixSymbol`, while it works fine for regular symbols or `MatrixSymbol` without curly braces

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the symbol name handling during lambdification
- When `dummify=True`, the system should replace problematic symbol names with dummy variables
- However, the combination of `MatrixSymbol` and curly braces is not being properly handled during this dummification process
- This suggests the issue lies in either the lambdification process or the matrix symbol handling code

3. Most Related Files:

sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py

```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `lambdify.py` contains the core lambdification functionality and is directly responsible for converting symbols to lambda functions
- `symbol.py` handles symbol creation and naming conventions
- `matexpr.py` defines matrix expressions and symbols
- `lambdarepr.py` handles the string representation of expressions for lambda functions
- `sympify.py` handles symbol conversion and validation
