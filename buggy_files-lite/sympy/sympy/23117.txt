Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that `Array([])` fails with a ValueError while `Matrix([])` works successfully. This indicates inconsistent handling of empty arrays/lists between these two classes.

2. Cause Analysis:
Looking at the error trace, the problem occurs in the array creation process:
- The error happens in `_scan_iterable_shape` when trying to unpack values
- Specifically, it fails when trying to `zip(*[f(i) for i in pointer])` with an empty list
- This suggests the array initialization code doesn't properly handle empty lists, while the Matrix class does

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository information and the error trace, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py
sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py
sympy/matrices/dense.py
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
sympy/core/basic.py
```

These files are selected because:
- The error trace directly points to ndim_array.py and dense_ndim_array.py
- The matrices/dense.py and matrices/matrices.py would contain the working Matrix implementation that we want to match
- core/basic.py contains fundamental functionality that both Array and Matrix classes build upon
