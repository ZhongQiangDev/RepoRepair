Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `decompose()` function in intpoly with `separate=True` returns an arbitrarily ordered list of values from a dictionary using `list(poly_dict.values())`. This arbitrary ordering is causing test failures.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from relying on dictionary values() which has no guaranteed order in Python. When the values are converted to a list, the ordering is arbitrary. This becomes problematic when test cases expect results in a specific order or when the order matters for subsequent operations.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/polys/polytools.py
sympy/polys/constructor.py
sympy/polys/densebasic.py
```

Reasoning:
- `polytools.py` is most important as it contains core polynomial manipulation functions including the `decompose` function that's directly mentioned in the issue
- `constructor.py` likely contains polynomial construction logic that feeds into decomposition
- `densebasic.py` provides basic polynomial operations that may be used in decomposition

Note: While `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` was in the repository list, it had no content description provided, but would likely be relevant if we had its contents since the issue mentions "intpoly".
