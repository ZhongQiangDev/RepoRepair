Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `pairplot` with `hue_order` parameter that doesn't contain all values in the hue column, it raises a TypeError about 'isnan' function instead of simply not plotting those values
- This is a regression from seaborn < 0.11 where it would work correctly by just omitting those values

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error suggests there's a type conversion issue when handling missing/filtered values
- The error occurs in seaborn/_core.py when trying to apply isnan() function
- Since this is related to pairplot functionality and hue value handling, it likely involves the core plotting grid system and categorical data handling

3. Most Related Files:
```
seaborn/axisgrid.py
seaborn/categorical.py
seaborn/utils.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- axisgrid.py is most important as it contains the PairGrid and pairplot implementation which is directly involved in this issue
- categorical.py is relevant as it handles categorical data plotting and hue value processing
- utils.py may contain helper functions for data validation and processing that could be involved in the type error

I limited to 3 files since the other files in the repository (distributions.py, matrix.py, miscplot.py, palettes.py, rcmod.py, relational.py) are less likely to be involved in this specific hue_order filtering issue.
