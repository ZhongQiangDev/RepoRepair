Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `pairplot` function raises a KeyError when trying to plot a DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. Specifically, it fails with "['1'] not in index" when attempting to access the data.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because `pairplot` tries to access individual columns using single-level indexing, but the DataFrame has multi-level column names. When it tries to access '1' directly, it fails because the column names are tuples like ('A','1'), not single strings.

The core issue is in the `axisgrid.py` file where `PairGrid` attempts to handle the data access but doesn't properly account for MultiIndex columns. The error specifically occurs in the `map_diag` method when trying to access `self.data[var]`.

3. Most Related Files:
```
seaborn/axisgrid.py
seaborn/utils.py
seaborn/matrix.py
```

I selected these files because:
- `axisgrid.py` is the primary file containing the `pairplot` implementation and where the error occurs
- `utils.py` contains core utilities that might be needed for data handling
- `matrix.py` has related visualization code for handling complex data structures, though less directly involved

The other files in the repository are less relevant as they deal with different types of plots (categorical, distributions, etc.) that aren't directly related to this MultiIndex issue.
