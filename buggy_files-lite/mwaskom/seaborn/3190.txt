Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code attempts to create a bar plot using boolean values ([True, False]) for color mapping, but fails with a TypeError. The error occurs when trying to perform subtraction on boolean values during scale setup.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the scale setup process where the code tries to perform subtraction (`forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)`) on boolean values. This suggests that the color mapping system isn't properly handling boolean inputs by converting them to a numeric format before scale calculations. The error specifically mentions that boolean subtraction isn't supported and suggests using bitwise operations instead.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the error traceback and repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
seaborn/_core/scales.py
seaborn/_core/plot.py
seaborn/utils.py
```

The error originates in `scales.py` during the scale setup process, propagates through `plot.py` which handles the plotting logic, and `utils.py` might contain color mapping utilities. These files would need to be modified to properly handle boolean values in color mapping, likely by converting them to numeric values before scale calculations.
