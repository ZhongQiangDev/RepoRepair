Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `flask routes` command shows routes but doesn't display which subdomain each route belongs to
- Currently it only shows Endpoint, Methods, and Rule columns
- Users can't easily see which routes are assigned to which subdomains without checking configuration files

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue lies in how Flask's CLI command for displaying routes formats and presents the route information
- While Flask internally knows about subdomain assignments through blueprint registration, this information isn't being included in the route display output
- The core functionality would be in the CLI handling code that generates the route table display
- The route information is likely available through the Flask app's url_map but isn't being extracted and displayed

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
src/flask/cli.py
src/flask/blueprints.py
src/flask/scaffold.py
```

Reasoning:
- `cli.py` is the most important as it contains the CLI commands implementation, including the `routes` command that needs modification
- `blueprints.py` is relevant because it handles blueprint registration with subdomains and stores that information
- `scaffold.py` is included because it contains core routing functionality that both Flask app and blueprints inherit from
