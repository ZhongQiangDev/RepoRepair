Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- In Pylint 2.12.2 with Python 3.9, using custom braces in message template (`{{ "Category": "{category}" }}`) fails
- Instead of proper JSON output, it produces malformed output with just `" }` repeated
- A warning is shown about not recognizing the argument `{ "Category"`

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a message template parsing issue in newer versions of Pylint
- The template parser seems to be misinterpreting the double braces and JSON-style formatting
- The warning suggests the template parser is breaking up the template incorrectly at the first `{`
- This is likely related to the message formatting system in the reporters, particularly the text reporter which handles message templates

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
pylint/reporters/text.py
pylint/message/message.py
pylint/lint/pylinter.py
pylint/interfaces.py
pylint/lint/utils.py
```

The `text.py` is most important as it directly handles message template parsing and formatting. `message.py` contains the core message handling logic. `pylinter.py` coordinates the overall linting process including message handling. `interfaces.py` defines the reporter interfaces, and `lint/utils.py` contains supporting utilities for message processing.
