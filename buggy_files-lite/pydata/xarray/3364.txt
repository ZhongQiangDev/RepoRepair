Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When concatenating xray Datasets with different variables, users are forced to either:
  * Create dummy variables filled with NaN for missing variables
  * Drop mismatched variables entirely
- This is inconsistent with pandas.concat which handles missing variables more gracefully through outer joins

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue appears to be in the concatenation logic that requires exact variable matching
- The concatenation operation likely enforces strict variable alignment without providing flexibility for handling missing variables
- This differs from pandas' more relaxed approach of performing outer joins by default

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
xarray/core/concat.py
xarray/core/merge.py
xarray/core/combine.py
```

The `concat.py` file is most important as it contains the primary concatenation logic. The `merge.py` file is second as it handles merging operations and likely contains relevant joining logic. The `combine.py` file would be involved in the dataset combination operations. These files would need to be modified to implement more flexible variable handling during concatenation.
