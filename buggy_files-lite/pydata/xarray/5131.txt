Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The DatasetGroupBy text representation includes a trailing whitespace in the first line
- This causes conflicts between flake8 (which flags trailing whitespaces) and doctests (which require exact string matches)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The string representation of DatasetGroupBy objects is likely defined in the core groupby implementation
- The trailing whitespace appears to be unintentionally added in the string formatting of the object's representation
- This affects both interactive display and string conversion

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):
```
xarray/core/groupby.py
xarray/core/formatting.py
xarray/core/common.py
```

The `groupby.py` file is most important as it contains the `DatasetGroupBy` class implementation which is directly responsible for the string representation. The `formatting.py` file likely contains helper functions for string formatting used by various xarray classes. The `common.py` file may contain base classes or shared functionality that affects how objects are represented as strings.
