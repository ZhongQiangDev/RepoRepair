Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration is not being applied to variables and attributes in Python modules
- Specifically, when documenting variables like `var: String` and class attributes like `MyString.var: String`, the type alias defined in conf.py (`'String': 'example.MyString'`) is not being resolved

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Sphinx's autodoc extension processes type hints for variables and attributes
- The type alias resolution system likely needs to be applied during the signature processing phase for variables and attributes, not just for function parameters
- This would be handled in the autodoc system's type processing logic

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py
sphinx/domains/python.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py
sphinx/util/typing.py
```

Reasoning:
- `typehints.py` is most critical as it directly handles type hint processing in autodoc
- `directive.py` manages the autodoc directives and how they process documentation elements
- `python.py` handles Python domain-specific documentation including type handling
- `mock.py` could be relevant for how types are handled during import/mock scenarios
- `typing.py` provides core utilities for type handling and stringification

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in `typehints.py` to ensure type aliases are properly resolved for all variable and attribute contexts.
