Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The autosummary template is including imported members (like 'os') in the generated documentation even when `autosummary_imported_members = False` is set in the configuration. The output shows system modules and imported members that shouldn't be included.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the autosummary extension processes module members when generating documentation. The `members` variable in the template is including all module attributes regardless of the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration setting. This suggests the filtering of imported members isn't being properly applied during the template rendering process.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py
sphinx/util/template.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py
sphinx/config.py
sphinx/ext/autosummary.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py` is most important as it handles the core autosummary generation logic and template rendering
- `sphinx/util/template.py` is relevant as it manages template rendering and context
- `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` handles module importing and member inspection
- `sphinx/config.py` manages configuration settings like `autosummary_imported_members`
- `sphinx/ext/autosummary.py` would contain the extension's core functionality

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in the autosummary generation code to properly respect the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration setting.
