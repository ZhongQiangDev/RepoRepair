Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `struct.Struct` in type annotations, Sphinx's autodoc fails to resolve it with the error "class reference target not found: Struct"
- This happens while other standard library types like `pathlib.Path` resolve correctly

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Sphinx's autodoc system handles type annotations from the `struct` module
- The autodoc system is failing to properly resolve and document the `Struct` class from the standard library's `struct` module
- This seems to be a specific issue with how autodoc processes and cross-references certain standard library types

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the issue:

```
sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py
sphinx/domains/python.py
sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py
sphinx/util/typing.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `autodoc/directive.py` contains the core autodoc directive handling
- `autodoc/typehints.py` specifically handles type hint processing
- `domains/python.py` manages Python domain references and cross-references
- `autodoc/mock.py` handles mocking of imports which could affect type resolution
- `util/typing.py` provides utilities for type annotation handling
