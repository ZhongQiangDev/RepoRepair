Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `napoleon_use_param` configuration setting affects how Parameters sections are rendered but does not affect Other Parameters sections
- Other Parameters sections are always rendered as if `napoleon_use_param` was False, regardless of the actual setting

2. Cause Analysis:
- In the source code, the `_parse_other_parameters_section` method does not check the `napoleon_use_param` configuration value
- While `_parse_parameters_section` has logic to format differently based on `napoleon_use_param`, the Other Parameters section always uses `_format_fields` directly
- This inconsistency causes different formatting styles between Parameters and Other Parameters sections when they should follow the same rules

3. Most Related Files:
```
sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py
sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py
sphinx/config.py
```

The `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py` is most important as it contains the docstring parsing logic and the inconsistent handling between Parameters and Other Parameters sections. The `__init__.py` file in the same directory would contain the extension setup and configuration. The `config.py` handles the `napoleon_use_param` configuration setting.

These files would need to be modified to ensure consistent behavior between Parameters and Other Parameters sections based on the `napoleon_use_param` setting.
