Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Sphinx 3.2 rejects option directive syntax like `[enable=]PATTERN` that was previously accepted in earlier versions
- The error message indicates Sphinx 3.2 expects very specific option formats like "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", "/opt args" or "+opt args"

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a validation issue in how Sphinx processes option directives
- The error suggests Sphinx 3.2 added stricter validation rules for option syntax
- The core issue likely lies in the option directive parsing and validation code
- Since this is a directive-related issue, it would be in the directives handling code, particularly for standard domain directives that handle command-line options

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sphinx/domains/std.py
sphinx/directives/other.py
sphinx/registry.py
sphinx/parsers.py
sphinx/directives/code.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `sphinx/domains/std.py` is most important as it contains the standard domain implementation including option handling
- `sphinx/directives/other.py` contains core directive implementations
- `sphinx/registry.py` handles directive registration and processing
- `sphinx/parsers.py` contains the base parser implementation that processes directives
- `sphinx/directives/code.py` has additional directive implementations that may influence option handling

The fix would likely need to modify the option validation logic in the standard domain implementation to be more permissive of different option formats.
