Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Two separate "Symbols" sections appear in the HTML index output
- First section contains "@" entries before normal words
- Second section contains "£" and "←" entries after normal words
- Both sections share the same HTML anchor, causing navigation issues

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how special characters are categorized and grouped in the index generation
- The index processing logic seems to incorrectly split special characters into two groups instead of keeping them together
- This likely stems from how the index entries are sorted and grouped during HTML generation
- The anchor generation for these symbol sections is not unique, causing link conflicts

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py
sphinx/domains/index.py
sphinx/builders/html.py
sphinx/writers/html.py
sphinx/writers/html5.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `indexentries.py` is the core file handling index entry processing and grouping
- `domains/index.py` manages index directives and roles
- `builders/html.py` handles the HTML build process
- `writers/html.py` and `html5.py` handle the actual HTML output generation where the duplicate sections appear

The primary fix would likely need to be in `indexentries.py` to properly group all symbol entries together under a single section.
