Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Warning messages "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" appearing during Sphinx documentation builds
- This occurs specifically when building `singlehtml` or `latex` formats
- The issue started after upgrading to Sphinx 3.3

2. Cause Analysis:
- The warning suggests tables are not being assigned numbers properly in the build process
- This is likely related to the table numbering system in Sphinx's environment collectors and transforms
- The issue appears to be with how table references and numbers are being tracked and assigned during document processing
- Since it affects both singlehtml and latex formats, it's likely a core issue with table handling rather than format-specific

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py
sphinx/domains/std.py
sphinx/transforms/references.py
sphinx/directives/patches.py
sphinx/writers/latex.py
```

Reasoning:
- `toctree.py` is most important as it handles section and figure numbering assignments, which would likely include table numbering
- `std.py` contains the StandardDomain which manages enumerable nodes including tables
- `references.py` handles cross-references and transforms which could affect table numbering
- `patches.py` contains table-related directive patches that could influence numbering
- `latex.py` is included because it specifically handles table processing for one of the affected output formats
