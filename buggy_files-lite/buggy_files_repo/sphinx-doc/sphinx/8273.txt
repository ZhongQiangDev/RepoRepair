Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Man pages are being generated into a single directory `<build-dir>/man` instead of being organized into section-specific subdirectories like `man/man1`, `man/man3`, etc.
- This prevents proper integration with the Unix `MANPATH` functionality since the `man` program specifically looks for pages in section directories.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how Sphinx generates and organizes man pages during the build process
- The man page builder/writer is not creating the appropriate section-based directory structure
- The core functionality for man page generation and directory structure creation would be in the man page builder and writer components

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sphinx/builders/manpage.py
sphinx/writers/manpage.py
sphinx/cmd/build.py
sphinx/application.py
sphinx/environment/collectors/dependencies.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` is the primary file responsible for man page generation and would need to be modified to create section directories
- `sphinx/writers/manpage.py` handles the actual writing of man page content and would need to work with the new directory structure
- `sphinx/cmd/build.py` coordinates the build process and may need adjustments for the new directory handling
- `sphinx/application.py` manages the overall Sphinx application and builder configuration
- `sphinx/environment/collectors/dependencies.py` handles file dependencies and may need updates for the new directory structure
