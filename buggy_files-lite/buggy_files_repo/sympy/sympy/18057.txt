Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When comparing a SymPy Symbol with an object whose __repr__ returns a string that could be evaluated as a Python expression, SymPy attempts to eval() that string
- This is dangerous as eval() can execute arbitrary code
- In the example, comparing Symbol('x') with an object whose __repr__ returns 'x.y' causes an attempt to evaluate 'x.y', leading to an AttributeError

2. Root Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from SymPy's sympify() functionality trying to convert the comparison object into a SymPy expression
- Instead of safely handling the comparison, it attempts to parse and eval the object's string representation
- This happens in the Symbol.__eq__ method which calls sympify() on the comparison object
- The sympify() function then uses parse_expr() and eval_expr() on the string representation

3. Most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/symbol.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py
```

Reasoning:
- sympify.py contains the core sympify() function that attempts to convert objects to SymPy expressions
- expr.py contains the Expr class with __eq__ method that triggers the sympify
- symbol.py defines the Symbol class where the comparison originates
- basic.py contains foundational comparison logic
- sympy_parser.py handles the parsing of expressions that leads to unsafe eval()

The fix would likely need to modify how sympify() handles unknown objects during comparisons, particularly in sympify.py and expr.py.
