Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `expr.atoms()` method currently returns subclasses of `Atom` in an expression, but it should return objects that have no `.args` (leaf nodes) instead.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue lies in how leaf nodes are identified in the expression tree traversal. Currently, the code checks if something is a subclass of `Atom`, but the correct approach should be to check if an object has no `.args` attribute or if `.args` is empty. This is because being a leaf node is fundamentally about having no further decomposable parts (no arguments), rather than about class inheritance.

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files would be those handling core expression traversal and atom identification. Based on the repository information:

```
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/function.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `basic.py` contains the `Basic` class which defines fundamental tree traversal methods and atom collection
- `expr.py` contains the `Expr` class which inherits from `Basic` and implements specific expression behaviors
- `function.py` contains function-related classes that may be incorrectly identified as atoms

These files would need to be modified to change how leaf nodes are identified during tree traversal, focusing on the presence of `.args` rather than class inheritance from `Atom`.
