Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a ValueError
- It should instead construct the identity permutation when given non-disjoint cycles
- The cycles should be applied in left-to-right order

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the Permutation class constructor
- It's rejecting non-disjoint cycles instead of processing them sequentially
- The validation logic is likely too strict, preventing valid but overlapping cycle inputs
- The core functionality would be in the permutations.py file where the Permutation class is defined

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py
sympy/combinatorics/util.py
sympy/combinatorics/generators.py
```

The primary file is permutations.py as it contains the Permutation class and its constructor. The util.py file may contain helper functions for permutation operations. The generators.py file is included as it deals with permutation generation and may have related functionality.

I limited to 3 files since the other files in the repository information (testutil.py, trace.py, linearize.py, iterables.py) are less directly related to the core permutation construction functionality.
