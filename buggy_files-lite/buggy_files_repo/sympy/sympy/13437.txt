Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` returns `bell(oo)` instead of evaluating to infinity
- The Bell numbers represent the number of partitions of a set, which should approach infinity as n approaches infinity
- Similar issues were recently fixed for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers

2. Cause Analysis:
- The limit evaluation for Bell numbers is not properly implemented
- The `bell` function likely doesn't have proper handling for limit evaluation when n approaches infinity
- This is similar to previously fixed issues with other number sequences (Fibonacci, Lucas)
- The core issue is likely in the files handling special number sequences and limit evaluation

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py
sympy/series/limits.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/series/gruntz.py
sympy/series/limitseq.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `numbers.py` contains the Bell number implementation
2. `limits.py` handles the core limit evaluation functionality
3. `basic.py` provides fundamental evaluation methods
4. `gruntz.py` implements advanced limit evaluation algorithms
5. `limitseq.py` handles limits of sequences specifically

The fix would primarily involve modifying the Bell number implementation to properly handle limit evaluation as n approaches infinity.
