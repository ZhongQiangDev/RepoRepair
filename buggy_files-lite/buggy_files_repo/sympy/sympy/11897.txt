Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The LaTeX printer and pretty printer are producing inconsistent outputs for the same expressions
- Specifically:
  - For `exp(-x)*log(x)`, LaTeX shows `\frac{1}{e^{x}} \log{(x)}` while pretty printer shows `ℯ^(-x)⋅log(x)`
  - For `1/(x + y)/2`, LaTeX shows `\frac{1}{2x + 2y}` while pretty printer shows `1/(2⋅(x + y))`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue appears to be in how the LaTeX printer handles fractions and exponentials differently from the pretty printer
- The LaTeX printer seems to be applying additional simplification rules or different precedence rules
- The discrepancy likely stems from different implementations in the LaTeX printing module versus the pretty printing module
- The main components involved would be the LaTeX printer, pretty printer, and their shared printing infrastructure

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/printing/latex.py
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/printing/printer.py
sympy/printing/str.py
sympy/printing/defaults.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `latex.py` contains the LaTeX printer implementation that's producing the inconsistent output
- `pretty.py` contains the pretty printer implementation that we want to match
- `printer.py` contains the base printer class that both implementations inherit from
- `str.py` and `defaults.py` contain core printing infrastructure that affects how expressions are processed for display
