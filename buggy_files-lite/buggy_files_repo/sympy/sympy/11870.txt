Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that SymPy's `trigsimp()` function is not converting exponential expressions with imaginary arguments into their equivalent trigonometric forms. Specifically:
- `1/2 * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` should simplify to `sin(k)`
- `1/2/k * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` should simplify to `sinc(k)`

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be related to SymPy's trigonometric simplification system not recognizing or applying Euler's formula:
`sin(x) = (exp(ix) - exp(-ix))/(2i)`
The issue lies in the conversion between exponential and trigonometric representations, which should be handled by the trigonometric simplification routines.

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
sympy/simplify/fu.py
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
sympy/simplify/hyperexpand.py
sympy/series/fourier.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `trigsimp.py` contains the main trigonometric simplification routines
- `fu.py` has specialized trigonometric transformations including exponential-trigonometric conversions
- `trigonometric.py` defines the core trigonometric function behaviors
- `hyperexpand.py` handles expansion of special functions including exponential forms
- `fourier.py` deals with Fourier series which involve similar exponential-trigonometric relationships

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in `trigsimp.py` and `fu.py` to properly handle the conversion between exponential and trigonometric forms.
