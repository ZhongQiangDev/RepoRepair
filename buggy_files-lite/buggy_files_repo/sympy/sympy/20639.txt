Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is with the rendering of `pi**(1/E)`. The output shows:
```
-1___
╲╱ π 
```
Which incorrectly suggests a negative square root of π, when it should be showing π raised to the power of 1/e.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The LaTeX and str representations are correct (`\pi^{e^{-1}}` and `pi**exp(-1)` respectively)
- The issue appears to be in the pretty printing system's handling of fractional/irrational exponents
- The system seems to be misinterpreting 1/e as -1 and incorrectly applying square root notation

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/core/compatibility.py
sympy/printing/str.py
```

The first two files are most important as they handle the pretty printing system that's producing the incorrect output. The numbers.py file is relevant as it handles numerical operations and exponents. The compatibility and str.py files provide supporting functionality for printing and representation.
