Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The LaTeX printer is generating an invalid LaTeX string for indexed matrix expressions. Specifically, when printing `(M*N)[i, j]`, it produces `\sum_{i_{1}=0}^{k - 1} M_{i, _i_1} N_{_i_1, j}` which has invalid double subscripts with `_` that LaTeX cannot compile.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the LaTeX printer handles matrix multiplication with indexed expressions. The printer is incorrectly formatting the subscript indices, adding extra underscore characters that make the LaTeX syntax invalid. This is likely due to how the tensor/matrix indexing is translated into LaTeX format.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/printing/latex.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
sympy/tensor/indexed.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/printing/str.py
```

The `latex.py` file is most important as it handles LaTeX printing. `matmul.py` and `matexpr.py` handle matrix multiplication and expressions. `indexed.py` deals with index handling, and `str.py` provides base printing functionality. The bug likely needs to be fixed in the LaTeX printer's handling of indexed matrix expressions, primarily in `latex.py`.
