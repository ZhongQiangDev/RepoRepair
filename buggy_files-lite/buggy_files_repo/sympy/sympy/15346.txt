Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that SymPy fails to simplify trigonometric expressions with rational number arguments. Specifically:
- `sin(x)*sin(y) + cos(x)*cos(y)` correctly simplifies to `cos(x-y)`
- But `sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + cos(1/50)*cos(1/25)` does not simplify to `cos(1/50-1/25)`

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the trigonometric simplification system's handling of rational number arguments. While the symbolic simplification rules work for variables, they're not being properly applied when the arguments are rational numbers. This likely involves both the trigonometric simplification functions and the rational number handling system.

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
sympy/simplify/fu.py
sympy/polys/domains/pythonrationalfield.py
sympy/polys/domains/pythonrational.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. `trigsimp.py` contains the core trigonometric simplification logic
2. `trigonometric.py` defines the fundamental trigonometric function behavior
3. `fu.py` contains specialized trigonometric transformations and simplifications
4. `pythonrationalfield.py` handles rational number field operations
5. `pythonrational.py` provides the base rational number implementation

The primary fix would likely need to be implemented in the trigonometric simplification system to ensure it handles rational arguments with the same effectiveness as symbolic variables.
