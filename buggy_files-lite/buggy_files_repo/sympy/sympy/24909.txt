Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that `milli*W` incorrectly evaluates to 1 instead of milli-watts (mW). Specifically:
- `milli*W == 1` returns True when it should be False
- `W*milli` returns a non-simplified expression with Prefix and watt

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the prefix (milli) interacts with units (W). The multiplication operation between a prefix and unit is not being handled correctly, causing:
- Incorrect evaluation when prefix is on the left side of multiplication
- Inconsistent behavior depending on order of multiplication
- Lack of proper simplification to standard unit notation (mW)

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files for this prefix-unit multiplication issue:

```
sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py
sympy/core/mul.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/core/expr.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. prefixes.py would contain the prefix definitions and their behavior
2. mul.py handles multiplication operations between different types
3. numbers.py handles numerical operations and conversions
4. basic.py provides core functionality for all symbolic objects
5. expr.py handles expression evaluation and simplification

The fix would likely need to modify how prefixes interact with units during multiplication operations, particularly in the prefix handling code.
