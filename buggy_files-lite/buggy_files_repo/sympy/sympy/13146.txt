Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem shows that when subtracting two equivalent expressions:
- expr1 = S(1)/2*x**2.5
- expr2 = S(1)*x**(S(5)/2)/2
The result should be 0 since they represent the same mathematical expression, but instead returns:
`-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how SymPy handles floating-point exponents (2.5) versus rational exponents (5/2)
- Even though 2.5 and 5/2 are mathematically equivalent, the expressions aren't being properly simplified
- This suggests a problem in either:
  - The power simplification logic
  - The expression comparison/cancellation system
  - The handling of rational vs floating-point exponents

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:
```
sympy/simplify/simplify.py
sympy/core/power.py
sympy/simplify/powsimp.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
```

These files are chosen because:
- `simplify.py` contains the main simplification logic
- `power.py` handles power operations and exponent processing
- `powsimp.py` specifically deals with power simplification
- `expr.py` contains core expression handling
- `numbers.py` handles numerical types including rational and float conversions
