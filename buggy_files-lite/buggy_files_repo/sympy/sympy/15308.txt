Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The LaTeX output for `trace(A**2)` shows as `'Trace(A**2)'`
- Two issues:
  - "Trace" is not in proper LaTeX format (should be \mathrm{Tr} or similar)
  - The inner expression `A**2` is not properly converted to LaTeX (should be A^2)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The trace printer is not properly handling LaTeX conversion
- The trace printer is not recursively applying LaTeX formatting to inner expressions
- This suggests issues in both the trace-specific LaTeX printing code and the general LaTeX printing system

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py
sympy/printing/latex.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/printing/defaults.py
sympy/printing/str.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `trace.py` contains the core Trace class implementation and needs to properly handle LaTeX printing
- `latex.py` contains the main LaTeX printing system that needs to handle trace expressions
- `matexpr.py` contains matrix expression base classes that influence how matrix operations are printed
- `defaults.py` and `str.py` contain base printing functionality that the LaTeX printer builds upon
