Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `sign` function cannot be rewritten in terms of `Abs` using the `.rewrite(Abs)` method
- There's also an inconsistency between `sign(0)` returning 0 and `0/Abs(0)` returning nan

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue is that the `sign` function lacks a proper rewrite rule for expressing it in terms of `Abs`
- The edge case of x=0 needs special handling since division by Abs(0) is undefined
- The implementation would need to consider the relationship between sign and absolute value: sign(x) = x/|x| for xâ‰ 0

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/simplify/simplify.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `complexes.py` would contain the core implementation of sign and abs functions
- `expr.py` contains the base expression class that would need to support the rewrite mechanism
- `simplify.py` handles expression rewriting and simplification rules
- `basic.py` provides fundamental functionality for all SymPy objects
- `numbers.py` handles special numeric cases like zero

The fix would primarily involve adding a rewrite rule in `complexes.py` and ensuring proper handling of the zero case.
