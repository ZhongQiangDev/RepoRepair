Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when substituting b=a in the expression r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b)), it returns 1 when it should be undefined since substituting b=a would make the denominator 0.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem stems from how SymPy handles substitutions in expressions containing potential undefined values. When b=a is substituted, we get:
- Numerator: 1/(a+a) + 1/(a-a) = 1/(2a) + undefined
- Denominator: 1/(a+a) - 1/(a-a) = 1/(2a) - undefined
The substitution system is incorrectly simplifying this expression to 1 instead of recognizing it as undefined due to division by zero.

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/simplify/radsimp.py
sympy/core/add.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- basic.py contains core substitution logic
- expr.py handles expression evaluation and simplification
- sympify.py manages conversion of expressions
- radsimp.py deals with rational simplification
- add.py handles addition operations and their evaluation

The issue likely needs to be fixed in the substitution and evaluation logic in these core files, particularly in how undefined expressions are handled during substitution operations.
