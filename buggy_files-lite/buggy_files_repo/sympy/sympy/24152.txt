Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is with the expansion of TensorProduct objects where scalar factors are involved. In the example, expanding `(2*U - V)x(U + V)` gives an incomplete result `2*Ux(U + V) - Vx(U + V)` instead of fully expanding both tensor factors.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is in the `TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct()` method. When creating a TensorProduct object with scalar factors, the constructor returns a `Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..))`. The current implementation doesn't properly handle these scalar factors during expansion, leading to incomplete expansion of the tensor factors.

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py
sympy/physics/quantum/qapply.py
sympy/tensor/tensor.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
sympy/core/coreerrors.py
```

The primary file is `tensorproduct.py` as it contains the actual TensorProduct class and the problematic `_eval_expand_tensorproduct()` method. `qapply.py` is second as it relies on proper tensor product expansion. `tensor.py` provides core tensor operations that may interact with tensor products. `matmul.py` handles matrix multiplication which can involve tensor products. `coreerrors.py` contains relevant error handling for non-commutative expressions.
