Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to convert a BlockDiagMatrix with a single matrix element back to a regular Matrix. The code raises a TypeError saying "'One' object is not subscriptable" when executing `B = sympy.Matrix(D)`. However, the same operation works fine when the BlockDiagMatrix contains two or more matrix elements.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the matrix conversion process where the BlockDiagMatrix's `as_explicit()` method tries to access elements using `self.blocks[row_block, col_block][i, j]`. When there's only one block, it seems the implementation is treating it as a scalar 'One' object instead of maintaining it as a matrix, causing the subscript operation to fail.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Looking at the traceback and repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
sympy/matrices/dense.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- blockmatrix.py contains the BlockDiagMatrix implementation where the error originates
- dense.py handles the Matrix conversion process
- matexpr.py provides base matrix expression functionality
- matrices.py contains core matrix operations
- matadd.py handles matrix addition which may be involved in block matrix operations

The primary fix would likely need to be made in blockmatrix.py to properly handle single-block cases in the BlockDiagMatrix implementation.
