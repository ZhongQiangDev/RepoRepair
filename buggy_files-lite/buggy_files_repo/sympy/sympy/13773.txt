Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `@` (matmul) operator is currently allowing scalar-matrix multiplication, which should not be allowed according to the NumPy standard
- `2@B` works when it should raise an error indicating that scalar operands are not allowed with `@`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The `@` operator implementation is simply copying the behavior of `*` (mul) operator
- Matrix multiplication should only work between matrices, not between a scalar and matrix
- This needs to be fixed in the core matrix operation files that handle operator implementations

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):
```
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
sympy/matrices/dense.py
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
sympy/matrices/matexpr.py
sympy/matrices/common.py
```

Reasoning:
- `matmul.py` contains the core implementation of matrix multiplication operations including the `@` operator
- `dense.py` implements dense matrix operations and likely contains operator definitions
- `matrices.py` contains base matrix classes and operations
- `matexpr.py` handles matrix expressions and operations at a symbolic level
- `common.py` contains common matrix utilities and shared functionality

The fix would primarily need to be implemented in these files to properly restrict the `@` operator to matrix-matrix multiplication only.
