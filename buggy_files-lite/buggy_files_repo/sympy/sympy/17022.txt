Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `lambdify` on an expression containing an `Identity` matrix, it incorrectly interprets `I` as the imaginary unit (1j) instead of treating it as an identity matrix
- This causes the output to be `array([[1.+1.j, 2.+1.j], [3.+1.j, 4.+1.j]])` instead of the expected `array([[2, 2], [3, 5]])`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the code printer in lambdify incorrectly translating the Identity matrix symbol 'I' to Python's built-in complex number 1j
- This happens because the printer doesn't have proper handling for identity matrices in its translation rules
- The core of the problem lies in the lambdify function's translation mechanism and how it handles matrix-specific symbols

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/utilities/lambdify.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/printing/pycode.py
sympy/matrices/dense.py
sympy/printing/julia.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- `lambdify.py` contains the main lambdify functionality that's causing the issue
- `matexpr.py` defines the matrix expression handling including Identity matrix
- `pycode.py` handles Python code printing/translation rules
- `dense.py` contains core matrix implementations 
- `julia.py` provides an example of proper matrix printing rules that could be referenced for fixing the Python printer
