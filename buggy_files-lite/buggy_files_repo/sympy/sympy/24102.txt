Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The new `parse_mathematica` function cannot parse Greek characters (like 'Î»') while the old `mathematica` function could
- This results in a SyntaxError when trying to parse Greek characters

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the parsing logic of the new `parse_mathematica` function
- Since the old `mathematica` function worked, but the new one fails specifically with Greek characters, this suggests the new parser has more restrictive character handling
- The error message indicates it fails to create an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), suggesting the parser doesn't properly recognize Greek characters as valid symbols

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/parsing/mathematica.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/printing/mathematica.py
```

I selected these files because:
- `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` is the most important as it contains both the old `mathematica` and new `parse_mathematica` functions where the issue occurs
- `sympy/core/sympify.py` is relevant as it handles the conversion of parsed expressions into SymPy objects
- `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` is included as it handles Mathematica syntax translation and may provide insights into how characters should be handled

The other files in the repository information are less relevant as they deal with rings, random variables, exceptions, and other functionality not directly related to parsing Mathematica expressions.
