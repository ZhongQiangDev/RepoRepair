Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `ccode()` function doesn't properly handle the `sinc(x)` function, returning an unsupported message instead of a valid C implementation
- However, it can handle the equivalent piecewise expression that defines sinc(x)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The `ccode()` function doesn't have a direct mapping for the `sinc(x)` function to C code
- The function should be able to convert sinc(x) into its piecewise definition automatically before generating C code
- The core issue lies in the C code printer's handling of special functions and its inability to automatically rewrite sinc into its piecewise form

3. Most relevant files (ordered by importance):

```
sympy/printing/ccode.py
sympy/functions/special/singularity/functions.py
sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py
```

The `ccode.py` is most important as it handles C code generation. The other files are relevant for handling special functions, piecewise expressions, and trigonometric functions that make up the sinc function definition.
