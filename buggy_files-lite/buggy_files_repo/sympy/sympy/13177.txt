Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `Mod(x**2, x)` operation incorrectly returns 0 for non-integer values of x. When x=1.5, it should return 0.75 (since 1.5Â² = 2.25, and 2.25 mod 1.5 = 0.75) but instead returns 0.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue is in the evaluation logic of Mod class where it assumes that if p is a power (p.is_Pow) with an integer exponent and its base equals q, then the result should be 0. However, this assumption is only valid when the base is an integer. The code doesn't validate whether the base is an integer before applying this rule.

3. Most relevant files:
```
sympy/core/mod.py
sympy/core/power.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sympy/core/mod.py` is most important as it contains the Mod class and its evaluation logic where the bug exists
- `sympy/core/power.py` is relevant as it handles power operations and the issue involves x**2
- `sympy/core/numbers.py` is relevant as it deals with number types and the issue manifests with non-integer numbers

These files form the core components involved in modular arithmetic operations and number handling in SymPy, which are directly related to the reported issue.
