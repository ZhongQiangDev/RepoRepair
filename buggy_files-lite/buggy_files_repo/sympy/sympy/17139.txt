Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to simplify `cos(x)**I` where I is the imaginary unit. The error message indicates an invalid comparison of complex number I during the simplification process.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error originates in `fu.py` where it tries to compare a complex exponent (I) using `<` operator. This happens in the `_f` function during bottom-up traversal when checking `if (rv.exp < 0) == True`. Complex numbers don't have a natural ordering, so this comparison is invalid.

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/simplify/fu.py
sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py
sympy/core/expr.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- `fu.py` contains the direct source of the error in its trigonometric simplification logic
- `trigsimp.py` is the parent module that calls into fu.py's functions
- `complexes.py` handles complex number operations that should be considered for the fix
- `trigonometric.py` defines the trigonometric functions involved
- `expr.py` contains the base expression handling including complex number comparisons
