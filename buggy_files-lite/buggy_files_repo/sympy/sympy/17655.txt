Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is with inconsistent behavior when multiplying a Point object with a number using sympy.sympify(2.0):
- `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine
- `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a TypeError

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the order of multiplication matters. When the number is on the left side of the multiplication, the operation tries to create a Point from the Mul result (2.0*point2) rather than properly scaling the point coordinates. This suggests an issue with the Point class's multiplication handling and type checking.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/geometry/point.py
sympy/geometry/entity.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/core/mul.py
sympy/core/basic.py
```

The files are ordered this way because:
- `point.py` contains the Point class implementation which is directly involved in the issue
- `entity.py` contains the base geometric entity class that Point inherits from
- `sympify.py` handles the sympification process that's involved in the error
- `mul.py` handles multiplication operations
- `basic.py` provides core functionality for all SymPy objects

The fix would likely need to modify the Point class's multiplication handling to ensure commutative behavior regardless of operand order.
