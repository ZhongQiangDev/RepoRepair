Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The LaTeX printer is not maintaining the same monomial order as str() and pretty() printers when displaying polynomials. While str() and pretty() show monomials in descending degree order (x^5, x^4, x^3, x^2, x, constant), the LaTeX output mixes this order.

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be an issue with how the LaTeX printer handles the ordering of terms in polynomials. The core functionality likely resides in the polynomial handling code and the LaTeX printer implementation. The printer should respect the same ordering logic used by str() and pretty() printers.

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/printing/latex.py
sympy/polys/polytools.py
sympy/polys/orderings.py
sympy/printing/printer.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `latex.py` is the primary file implementing LaTeX printing functionality
- `polytools.py` contains core polynomial manipulation code including term ordering
- `orderings.py` defines monomial ordering implementations
- `printer.py` contains base printer class that defines common printing behavior

These files together handle both the polynomial representation and printing logic that need to be coordinated to fix the ordering issue.
