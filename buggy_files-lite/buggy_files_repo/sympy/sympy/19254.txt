Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The current implementation of `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` in SymPy's polynomial factorization tools is using a less efficient bound compared to the Knuth-Cohen bound. This impacts the performance of polynomial factorization operations.

2. Cause Analysis:
The Mignotte bound is used to estimate the size of factors in polynomial factorization. The current implementation uses a simpler but less efficient bound, while research has shown that the Knuth-Cohen bound provides better results for polynomials with different degrees, densities and coefficient ranges.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the problem description, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/polys/factortools.py
sympy/polys/polytools.py
sympy/polys/densetools.py
sympy/polys/rings.py
sympy/polys/domains/domain.py
```

Reasoning:
- `factortools.py` would contain the core implementation of the Mignotte bound functions that need to be modified
- `polytools.py` contains high-level polynomial manipulation functions that may interact with the bounds
- `densetools.py` handles dense polynomial operations which could be affected by bound calculations
- `rings.py` provides polynomial ring operations that may use these bounds
- `domains/domain.py` contains base domain operations that support polynomial factorization
