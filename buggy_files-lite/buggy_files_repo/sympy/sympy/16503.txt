Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is with vertical alignment in pretty-printing a Sum expression. Specifically, the `x` term and the `+ 3` term are not properly aligned vertically in the output:
```
  ∞
 ___
 ╲
  ╲   x
  ╱     + 3
 ╱
 ‾‾‾
x = 1
```

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be a pretty-printing alignment issue in SymPy's pretty printer implementation. The Sum's internal term (`x + 3`) is not being properly formatted to align its components vertically. The pretty printer needs to handle the alignment of terms within Sum expressions, especially when those terms are additions.

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py
sympy/core/add.py
sympy/concrete/summations.py
sympy/printing/printer.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- `pretty.py` contains the main pretty-printing implementation that handles how expressions are formatted
- `stringpict.py` handles the actual string picture construction and alignment logic
- `add.py` defines how addition expressions are structured internally
- `summations.py` contains the Sum class implementation
- `printing/printer.py` contains base printer functionality

The fix would likely need to be implemented in either `pretty.py` or `stringpict.py` to properly handle the vertical alignment of terms within Sum expressions.
