Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `is_upper()` method raises an IndexError when called on a 4x2 matrix of zeros. The error occurs because the method tries to access an index (3,2) which is outside the matrix bounds, since a 4x2 matrix only has indices up to (3,1).

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem lies in the implementation of `is_upper()` which generates indices incorrectly for non-square matrices. The method iterates over indices using nested ranges:
```python
for i in range(1, self.rows)
for j in range(i)
```
For a 4x2 matrix, this generates indices like (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) - where (3,2) is invalid since it exceeds the column count.

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/matrices/matrices.py
sympy/matrices/dense.py
sympy/matrices/matrixbase.py
sympy/matrices/sparse.py
sympy/matrices/immutable.py
```

The main file is `matrices.py` as it contains the core matrix implementation including the `is_upper()` method. The other files inherit from or interact with this base implementation, with `dense.py` being particularly relevant as it handles dense matrix operations. The remaining files provide specialized matrix implementations that may be affected by this bug.
