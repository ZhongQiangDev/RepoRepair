Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The LaTeX expression `"\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"` is being parsed incorrectly into `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)` when it should be `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`. The key issue is missing brackets in the denominator, which changes the mathematical meaning.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in the LaTeX parsing logic, specifically how nested fractions are handled. The current implementation is not properly grouping the denominator fraction `\frac{1}{c^2}`, causing incorrect operator precedence in the resulting expression. The denominator is being parsed as a sequence of divisions (1/c^2) rather than a single fraction object (1/(c^2)).

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files:

```
sympy/parsing/latex.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/core/exprtools.py
sympy/printing/str.py
sympy/polys/polytools.py
```

The `sympy/parsing/latex.py` would be the main file handling LaTeX parsing, though it wasn't provided in the repository information. However, since this is a parsing issue that affects expression construction, the core number handling (`numbers.py`) and expression tools (`exprtools.py`) are highly relevant. The printing (`str.py`) and polynomial tools (`polytools.py`) are also involved as they handle expression representation and manipulation.

The issue likely requires modifications to how nested fractions are parsed and how their components are grouped in the expression tree.
