Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code causes a `RecursionError` when checking `is_zero` property of a complex expression involving `cosh`, `acos`, `acosh`, and complex numbers (`i`).

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be an infinite recursion when evaluating whether the expression equals zero. This likely happens because:
- The expression contains nested inverse hyperbolic/trigonometric functions
- When simplifying to check if it's zero, it keeps recursively trying to evaluate these nested functions
- The presence of complex number `i` makes the evaluation more complicated
- The recursion depth exceeds Python's limit before reaching a conclusion

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py
sympy/assumptions/refine.py
sympy/core/evalf.py
```

Reasoning:
- `expr.py` contains the core `Expr` class which handles basic expression operations including `is_zero`
- `basic.py` provides fundamental symbolic computation capabilities used in expression evaluation
- `sqrtdenest.py` handles nested radical expressions which is relevant for complex function evaluation
- `refine.py` deals with expression refinement and simplification during evaluation
- `evalf.py` handles numerical evaluation which may be attempted during the zero-checking process
