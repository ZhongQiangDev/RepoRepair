Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue shows inconsistent behavior between sympy v1.5.1 and v1.6.2 when using sympify with evaluate=False:
- In v1.5.1, both evaluate=True and evaluate=False give the same result: `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)`
- In v1.6.2, evaluate=False gives `4*ceiling(x/4) - 3` while evaluate=True gives `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)`

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be an issue with how ceiling function expressions are handled during sympification and simplification. The evaluate=False flag should prevent premature evaluation/simplification, but in v1.6.2 it's still transforming the ceiling expression when evaluate=False. This suggests the issue lies in:
- The core sympification process
- The ceiling function's evaluation logic
- The simplification rules applied during expression processing

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/core/evalf.py
sympy/core/symbol.py
```

These files are crucial because:
- sympify.py contains the core sympification logic that's behaving differently between versions
- expr.py handles expression evaluation and simplification rules
- basic.py provides fundamental symbolic computation capabilities
- evalf.py handles evaluation of expressions
- symbol.py manages symbolic variables and their transformations

The issue likely stems from changes in how these core components interact during expression processing, particularly in the sympification and simplification stages.
