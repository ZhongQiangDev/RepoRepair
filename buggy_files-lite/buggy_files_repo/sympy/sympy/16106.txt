Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails when trying to print an `Indexed` object to MathML format, raising a `TypeError: 'Indexed' object is not iterable`. This occurs when calling `sympy.printing.mathml()` on an `IndexedBase` object with an index.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the MathML printer tries to iterate over the `Indexed` object in its `_print_Basic` method, but `Indexed` objects are not designed to be iterable. The printer needs a specific method to handle `Indexed` objects properly, similar to how other printers (like LaTeX, string) handle them.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/printing/mathml.py
sympy/tensor/indexed.py
sympy/printing/printer.py
sympy/core/basic.py
sympy/printing/defaults.py
```

Reasoning:
- `mathml.py` is the primary file where the MathML printing functionality is implemented and where the fix needs to be added
- `indexed.py` contains the `Indexed` class definition that needs to be properly handled
- `printer.py` contains the base printer functionality that mathml.py extends
- `basic.py` contains core functionality that affects how objects are printed
- `defaults.py` contains default printing behaviors that might need to be considered
