Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue shows that simplifying the expression `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1` produces an inequivalent result. When evaluating at x=9/5, the original and simplified expressions give different numerical values:
- Original: -1.32255049319339
- Simplified: -0.739051169462523 - 0.189590423018741*I

The simplified version incorrectly introduces an imaginary component that shouldn't be there.

2. Cause Analysis:
The problem appears to be in the simplification process where:
- Original: `(-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1`
- Simplified: `12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x)`

The transformation introduces terms that can produce complex numbers when evaluated with certain real values. This suggests an issue with how power expressions are handled during simplification, particularly when dealing with negative bases and fractional exponents.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/simplify/simplify.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/core/power.py
sympy/core/numbers.py
sympy/core/evalf.py
```

These files are chosen because:
- `simplify.py` contains the main simplification logic that's transforming the expression
- `expr.py` handles core expression manipulation and evaluation
- `power.py` would handle the power operations that are central to this issue
- `numbers.py` deals with numeric evaluation and transformations
- `evalf.py` handles numerical evaluation where the discrepancy becomes apparent
