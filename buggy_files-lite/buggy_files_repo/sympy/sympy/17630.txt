Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks multiple times. While single multiplication works, double multiplication fails with an AttributeError stating that 'Zero' object has no attribute 'cols'.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that when BlockMatrix multiplication occurs, the resulting zero blocks are converted from ZeroMatrix objects to Zero objects (from sympy.core.numbers). This causes issues in subsequent multiplications because the Zero class doesn't have the matrix attributes (like 'cols') that are expected in block matrix operations.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the error trace and functionality, here are the most relevant files:

```
sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py
sympy/matrices/dense.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- blockmatrix.py contains the core BlockMatrix implementation where the error occurs
- matmul.py handles matrix multiplication operations
- matexpr.py defines base matrix expression classes including ZeroMatrix
- matadd.py handles matrix addition which is part of block operations
- dense.py provides underlying matrix operations support

The fix would likely need to focus on blockmatrix.py to ensure ZeroMatrix objects are preserved during block multiplication operations rather than being converted to Zero objects.
