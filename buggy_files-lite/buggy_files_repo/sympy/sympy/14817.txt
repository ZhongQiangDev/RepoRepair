Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When trying to pretty print a matrix addition expression containing a MatrixSymbol with an asterisk in its name ('y*'), it raises a SympifyError
- The error occurs because the code is trying to sympify the string 'y*' which is invalid Python syntax

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the pretty printer attempting to sympify the name of the MatrixSymbol as a string
- This is incorrect because MatrixSymbol names should be treated as identifiers/labels, not as expressions to be evaluated
- The code in _print_MatAdd is wrongly checking S(item.args[0]).is_negative, which tries to sympify the MatrixSymbol's name

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):
```
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/core/sympify.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/printing/str.py
sympy/core/basic.py
```

The pretty.py file contains the problematic pretty printing code, sympify.py handles the sympification that's failing, matexpr.py defines the MatrixSymbol class, str.py provides base printing functionality, and basic.py contains core functionality they all depend on.
