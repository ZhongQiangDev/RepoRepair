Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `refine()` function fails to simplify complex arguments correctly when given real number assumptions. Specifically, when `Q.positive(a)` is provided, `refine()` doesn't simplify `abs(a)` to `a` and `arg(a)` to `0`, which it should since `a` is assumed positive real.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the refinement logic for complex number functions (`abs()` and `arg()`) when dealing with assumptions about real numbers. The `refine()` function isn't properly propagating or applying the real/positive assumptions to simplify these complex number operations. This likely involves both the core refinement logic and the complex number function implementations.

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/assumptions/refine.py
sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
sympy/assumptions/assume.py
sympy/simplify/simplify.py
sympy/assumptions/sathandlers.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- `refine.py` contains the core refinement logic that needs to handle these cases
- `complexes.py` implements the complex number functions (`abs`, `arg`) that need refinement
- `assume.py` handles the assumption system that should inform the refinement
- `simplify.py` contains general simplification logic that may be involved
- `sathandlers.py` contains handlers for evaluating assumptions that affect refinement
