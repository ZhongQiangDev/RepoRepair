Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `mathematica_code(Max(x,2))` is producing `'Max(2, x)'` instead of the expected `'Max[x,2]'`. The issues are:
- Wrong brackets: Using parentheses () instead of square brackets []
- Wrong argument order: Arguments are reordered to put 2 before x

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the translation of Python/SymPy's Max function to Mathematica syntax
- The code is incorrectly using Python's function call syntax (parentheses) instead of Mathematica's square bracket syntax
- The argument ordering is being altered, possibly due to SymPy's internal ordering of terms

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/printing/mathematica.py
sympy/core/relational.py
sympy/printing/codeprinter.py
```

Reasoning:
- `mathematica.py` is the primary file responsible for Mathematica code generation and would handle the translation of Max function syntax
- `relational.py` contains the implementation of Max/Min functions and their argument handling
- `codeprinter.py` provides the base class for code printers, which would affect how functions are generally printed

These files would need to be modified to:
1. Ensure proper bracket syntax for Mathematica functions
2. Preserve the original argument order for Max function
3. Handle the base printing behavior for mathematical functions
