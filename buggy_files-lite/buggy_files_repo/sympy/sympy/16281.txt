Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Extra empty line at the bottom of the ∏ symbol making it unnecessarily large
- The ∏ symbol is too wide/fat compared to other symbols
- The top bar could potentially be extended for better aesthetics

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the pretty printing implementation for Product objects. The rendering of the Product symbol (∏) and its formatting is likely handled by the pretty printing system, specifically for handling special mathematical notations. The empty line and width issues suggest the core problem is in how the Product symbol template is defined and rendered in the pretty printing modules.

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sympy/concrete/products.py
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py
sympy/interactive/printing.py
sympy/core/mul.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `sympy/concrete/products.py` is most important as it defines the Product class and its core behavior
- `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` contains the main pretty printing implementation
- `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py` handles the actual string-based picture rendering
- `sympy/interactive/printing.py` manages interactive display settings
- `sympy/core/mul.py` handles multiplication operations which may affect product display
