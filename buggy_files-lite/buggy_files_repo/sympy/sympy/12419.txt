Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The sum of all elements in an identity matrix is returning 0 when it should be n (the size of the matrix). The code correctly identifies that M.T * M is an identity matrix and confirms this through element-wise checks and diagonal sum, but fails when computing the total sum.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how SymPy handles the summation of elements in an identity matrix when using nested Sum operations. The outer Sum operation is likely not properly handling the inner Sum's result, causing the non-diagonal zeros to cancel out the diagonal ones incorrectly. This suggests a problem in either:
- How matrix element access works within nested summations
- How the Sum operation evaluates matrix expressions
- How the refinement of orthogonal matrix properties affects summation

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sympy/concrete/summations.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py
sympy/assumptions/handlers/matrices.py
sympy/matrices/dense.py
```

The `summations.py` file is most critical as it handles the Sum operations directly involved in the bug. `matexpr.py` and `matmul.py` are important as they define how matrix expressions and multiplication work, which is relevant since the identity matrix is created through M.T * M. The `matrices.py` handlers file is relevant for the orthogonal assumption handling, and `dense.py` provides core matrix functionality that could affect element access during summation.
