Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behaviors:
- The Mathematica code printer incorrectly handles Derivative(func(vars), deriver)
  - Currently outputs: Derivative(f(t), t)
  - Should output: D[f[t],t]
- Floats with exponents are not formatted correctly
  - Currently outputs: 1.0e-4
  - Should output: 1.0*^-4

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue lies in the MCodePrinter class's implementation in the mathematica.py file, which lacks proper handling for:
- Derivative expressions (_print_Derivative method missing)
- Float expressions with exponents (_print_Float method missing)

3. Most Related Files:
```
sympy/printing/mathematica.py
sympy/core/function.py
sympy/printing/str.py
sympy/core/expr.py
sympy/printing/printer.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- mathematica.py: Contains the MCodePrinter class that needs modification
- function.py: Handles derivative functionality and function expressions
- str.py: Provides base string printing functionality that mathematica.py builds upon
- expr.py: Contains core expression handling that derivatives and floats inherit from
- printer.py: Contains base printer class functionality that MCodePrinter inherits

The most critical file is mathematica.py as it directly contains the code that needs to be modified to fix both issues.
