Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The pretty printing of vectors is broken, showing redundant/incorrect formatting with nested parentheses and duplicated terms
- The baseline alignment is incorrect (not centered) when it does print properly

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the pretty printing system's handling of vector expressions, specifically when dealing with power operations and fractions
- The problem involves both the vector-specific printing logic and the general pretty printing infrastructure
- The baseline alignment issue suggests problems in the pretty printing layout calculations

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):
```
sympy/physics/vector/printing.py
sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
sympy/physics/vector/vector.py
sympy/printing/defaults.py
sympy/vector/vector.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` contains the vector-specific pretty printing implementation
- `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` handles the core pretty printing functionality and layout
- `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` defines the vector class and its representation methods
- `sympy/printing/defaults.py` provides default printing behaviors that may affect vector display
- `sympy/vector/vector.py` contains additional vector printing-related code

The main fix would likely need to be implemented in the vector-specific pretty printing code while coordinating with the general pretty printing system.
