Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Currently matplotlib only exposes `__version__` as a string
- There's no easy way to programmatically compare version numbers
- String comparisons of versions can be problematic when reaching versions like 3.10 or 4.10

2. Cause Analysis:
- The version information is only stored as a string (`__version__`)
- Missing standardized version comparison utilities like `version_info` tuple or `LooseVersion` instance
- This is a structural issue in how version information is defined and exposed in the package

3. Most Related Files:
```
setup.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
lib/matplotlib/style/core.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `setup.py` is the main package configuration file where version information is typically defined
- `pyplot.py` is the main interface module where version information would be exposed to users
- `style/core.py` deals with versioning-related features for styles and would benefit from proper version comparison

The other files in the repository information (setupext.py, artist.py, dates.py) are less relevant as they focus on specific functionality rather than package-level version information.
