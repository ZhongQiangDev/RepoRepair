Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When saving a figure with PostScript backend, a TypeError occurs if there's a text label or title containing an empty line (line break with no content)
- The specific error is "TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object"
- This only happens with PostScript (.eps) backend, not with other backends like PNG, PDF, SVG, Qt

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in backend_ps.py when trying to unpack values from a stream
- Based on the traceback, the issue is in the text rendering code where it tries to process text with empty lines
- The stream returns None for empty lines, but the code attempts to unpack values from it without checking if it's None
- The suggested fix of adding `if curr_stream:` check indicates this is a missing null check issue

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py
lib/matplotlib/text.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

These files are chosen because:
1. backend_ps.py is the most critical as it contains the PostScript backend code where the error occurs
2. text.py handles text rendering and is in the error traceback
3. pyplot.py provides the high-level interface and contains text-related functions that could be affected

The other files in the repository information don't appear to be directly related to this PostScript text rendering issue.
