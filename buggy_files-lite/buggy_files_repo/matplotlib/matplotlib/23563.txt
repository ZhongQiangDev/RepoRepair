Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Initially code runs fine but after giving numpy arrays as input, it throws 'input operand has more dimensions than allowed by the axis remapping' error
- Subsequently, even when using int numbers, it throws 'AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d''
- The error persists until kernel restart

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error '_verts3d' attribute missing suggests an issue with the 3D line rendering pipeline
- The error occurs in the drawing process, specifically in mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py
- The problem seems to stem from matplotlib's Line3D object state becoming corrupted after handling invalid array dimensions
- The persistence of the error until kernel restart indicates the corruption affects the matplotlib backend state

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/lines.py
lib/matplotlib/artist.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- lines.py contains the core Line implementation that Line3D builds upon
- artist.py contains the base Artist class that handles drawing and attribute management
- pyplot.py provides the high-level interface being used and manages figure/axes state

I excluded other files like tri/triinterpolate.py as they're not directly related to the Line3D rendering issue.
