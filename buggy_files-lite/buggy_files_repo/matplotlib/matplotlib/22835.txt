Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using BoundaryNorm with imshow and mousing over the image, the program crashes with a ValueError stating "BoundaryNorm is not invertible"
- This breaks the interactive functionality of the plot

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in the cursor data formatting when trying to get inverse values from BoundaryNorm
- The format_cursor_data method in artist.py tries to use norm.inverse() on a BoundaryNorm object
- BoundaryNorm doesn't support inverse operations since it maps continuous values to discrete boundaries
- This is a fundamental limitation of BoundaryNorm's design, as it's meant for discrete color mapping

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
lib/matplotlib/artist.py
lib/matplotlib/image.py
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
```

The files are ordered this way because:
- colors.py contains the BoundaryNorm implementation that needs modification
- artist.py contains the format_cursor_data method that triggers the error
- image.py handles the image display and cursor interaction
- cm.py contains ScalarMappable which connects the normalization to the color mapping
