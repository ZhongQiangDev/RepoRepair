Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using mplcursor with matplotlib 3.7.1, clicking data points eventually leads to an AttributeError
- The error occurs because a NoneType object has no 'canvas' attribute
- This happens specifically after clicking a few data points
- The error persists for subsequent data point selections

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error trace shows the issue originates in the offsetbox.py file
- The problem occurs in the on_release and disconnect methods of an offsetbox class
- The error suggests that ref_artist.figure becomes None at some point
- This appears to be a reference management issue where the artist loses its connection to the figure/canvas
- The issue is specific to matplotlib 3.7.1, suggesting a regression from previous versions

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py
lib/matplotlib/widgets.py
lib/matplotlib/artist.py
```

I selected these files because:
- offsetbox.py is directly implicated in the error trace and handles the canvas/figure references
- widgets.py manages interactive elements like cursors which is relevant to the mplcursor functionality
- artist.py contains the base Artist class which handles figure/canvas relationships that appear to be breaking

I excluded pyplot.py and style/core.py as they seem less directly related to this reference management issue.
