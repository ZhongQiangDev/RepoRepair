Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The legend in matplotlib cannot be made draggable during its initial creation using a keyword argument
- Currently users need to call a separate method after creating the legend to make it draggable

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Legend class initialization doesn't include a 'draggable' parameter in its __init__ method
- The draggable functionality is implemented through the DraggableLegend class, but it's only accessible after legend creation
- The legend dragging feature is implemented as a post-creation modification rather than an initialization option

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
lib/matplotlib/legend.py
lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

The `legend.py` file is most important as it contains both the Legend and DraggableLegend classes that would need modification. The `offsetbox.py` file contains the base draggable functionality that Legend uses. The `pyplot.py` file contains the high-level legend creation interface that would need to expose the new parameter.

I excluded `text.py` as it's less directly related to the legend dragging functionality.
