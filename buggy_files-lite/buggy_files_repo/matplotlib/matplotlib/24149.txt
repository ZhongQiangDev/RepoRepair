Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `ax.bar([np.nan], [np.nan])` raises a StopIteration exception in matplotlib 3.6.1
- This breaks seaborn's histogram function which relies on drawing and removing a "phantom" bar
- The issue specifically occurs when the x-position is NaN, while NaN heights work fine

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in the bar plotting code when trying to convert x-coordinates
- The traceback shows it fails in `_convert_dx` when trying to find the first finite value
- The issue appears related to changes made to handle NaN values in bar plots in version 3.6.1
- The core problem seems to be in the coordinate conversion and width calculation for bars

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
lib/matplotlib/container.py
lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py
```

I'm listing these files because:
- `pyplot.py` contains the high-level bar plotting interface
- `container.py` has the `BarContainer` class that manages bar plot elements
- `axes/_axes.py` (though not in the repository info but mentioned in the traceback) contains the core bar plotting implementation where the error occurs

I limited to 3 files since the others in the repository information (`colors.py`, `dates.py`, `units.py`, `style/core.py`, `colorbar.py`) are not directly related to the bar plotting functionality where the issue occurs.
