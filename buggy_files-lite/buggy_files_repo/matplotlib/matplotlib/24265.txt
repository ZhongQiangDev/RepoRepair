Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The code `plt.style.library["seaborn-colorblind"]` raises a KeyError in matplotlib v3.6.1
- This code worked fine in matplotlib v3.4.3
- The error suggests the style name "seaborn-colorblind" is no longer a valid key in the style library

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be related to a change in how matplotlib handles style names between versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1
- Looking at the repository files, this would involve the style system and how style libraries are registered/accessed
- The issue likely stems from changes in style naming conventions or deprecation of certain seaborn-related style names

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):
```
lib/matplotlib/style/core.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
```

The `style/core.py` is most important as it handles the style library and style application. `pyplot.py` contains the high-level interface including style-related functions. `cm.py` and `colors.py` are relevant as they handle color-related functionality which is particularly important for the seaborn-colorblind style.
