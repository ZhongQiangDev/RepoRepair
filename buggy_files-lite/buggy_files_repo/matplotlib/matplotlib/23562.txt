Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When trying to get face colors from a 3D surface plot using `get_facecolors()`, it raises an AttributeError indicating that 'Poly3DCollection' object has no attribute '_facecolors2d'

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error suggests that the 3D plotting functionality (specifically Poly3DCollection) is not properly initializing or maintaining the _facecolors2d attribute
- This seems to be related to how colors are handled between 2D and 3D plotting contexts
- The issue likely involves the interaction between color mapping (cm.py), color handling (colors.py), and 3D plotting functionality

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- colors.py handles the core color functionality and conversions
- cm.py manages color mapping which is essential for surface plots
- pyplot.py contains the high-level plotting interface including 3D plotting functionality

The other files (texmanager.py and style/core.py) are less relevant as they deal with text rendering and style management respectively, which are not directly related to the color handling issue in 3D plots.
