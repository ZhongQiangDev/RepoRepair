Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A UserWarning is being generated about layout engine incompatibility when using `plt.subplots_adjust` even though `constrained_layout=False` is explicitly set
- This warning shouldn't appear when constrained_layout is disabled

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the layout engine compatibility check
- Even when constrained_layout is set to False, the warning is still triggered when using subplots_adjust
- This suggests the layout engine check isn't properly respecting the constrained_layout=False setting
- The warning comes from the figure's layout management system when attempting to adjust subplot parameters

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/figure.py
lib/matplotlib/gridspec.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- figure.py contains the core Figure class which handles layout management and subplot adjustments
- gridspec.py manages the grid-based layout system and subplot specifications
- pyplot.py provides the high-level interface including subplots_adjust function that triggers the warning
