Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- After calling `fig.align_labels()`, attempting to pickle the figure results in a TypeError indicating inability to pickle a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object.
- Without `align_labels()`, the pickling works fine.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The `align_labels()` method likely creates weak references to manage label alignments
- Weak references cannot be pickled in Python
- This suggests the figure object contains weak references after label alignment that prevent serialization

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):

```
lib/matplotlib/figure.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

The `figure.py` is most important as it contains the core `Figure` class and `align_labels()` implementation. The `pyplot.py` is secondary as it provides the interface layer. Other files in the repository information don't appear directly related to figure label alignment or pickling functionality.
