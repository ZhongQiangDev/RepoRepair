Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The colorbar fails to update after changing the norm of the mappable (plot) from linear to logarithmic
- `colorbar.update_normal(plot)` has no effect
- `colorbar.update_bruteforce(plot)` throws a ZeroDivisionError

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue appears to be in how the colorbar handles norm updates
- The ZeroDivisionError occurs in the LogNorm's inverse calculation when processing values
- The problem stems from the interaction between the ScalarMappable (plot), Colorbar, and LogNorm classes
- The norm change isn't properly propagated through the update mechanisms

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- colorbar.py contains the Colorbar class and its update mechanisms that are failing
- colors.py contains the LogNorm implementation where the ZeroDivisionError occurs
- cm.py contains the ScalarMappable class which handles the connection between data and colormapping

The other files (container.py, pyplot.py, style/core.py) are less relevant as they deal with higher-level plotting interfaces and style management rather than the core colorbar/normalization functionality where the issue lies.
