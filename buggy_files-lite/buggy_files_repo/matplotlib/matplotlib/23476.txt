Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a figure is unpickled on M1 Mac, its DPI value doubles each time
- This exponential increase in DPI eventually leads to an OverflowError
- This only happens on M1 MacBooks regardless of Python version

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to figure serialization/deserialization (pickling/unpickling)
- The problem occurs during figure reconstruction in the backend_macosx module
- When a figure is unpickled, it's trying to create a new figure manager with the existing figure
- The DPI value is being incorrectly handled during this process specifically on M1 Macs
- The issue is likely in the interaction between the figure state restoration and the MacOSX backend

3. Most relevant files:

```
lib/matplotlib/figure.py
lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

The `figure.py` file is most important as it handles figure serialization/deserialization through `__setstate__`. The `backend_macosx.py` would be crucial as the error occurs in the MacOSX backend during figure canvas initialization. `pyplot.py` is included as it provides the high-level interface for figure management and could be involved in the DPI handling chain.

I limited to 3 files since these would be the most directly involved in the bug. The other files in the repository information don't appear to be as relevant to this specific DPI/pickling issue.
