Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `set_visible(False)` call on a 3D subplot (ax1) is not hiding the subplot as expected
- The subplot remains visible even when explicitly set to be invisible

2. Likely Cause:
- This appears to be an issue with visibility handling specifically in 3D projections
- The visibility property may not be properly propagated to all components of the 3D axes
- The issue is related to how GridSpec and projection="3d" interact with visibility settings

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information provided and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
lib/matplotlib/gridspec.py
```

I'm limiting to these two files because:
- pyplot.py contains the core plotting functionality and subplot creation/management
- gridspec.py handles the subplot grid system which is directly involved in this issue
- The issue seems to be at the intersection of subplot management and 3D projection handling

Note: While there might be other relevant files dealing with 3D projections specifically, they weren't included in the repository information provided, so I'm limited to listing the files we can see that are most likely involved in this bug.
