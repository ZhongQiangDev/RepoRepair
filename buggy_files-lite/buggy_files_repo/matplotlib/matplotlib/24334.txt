Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `ax.set_xticks([0, 1], xticklabels=["a", "b"])`, invalid `xticklabels` parameter is silently ignored without validation
- The validation of kwargs only happens when `labels` parameter is explicitly passed

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue lies in the validation logic of the tick-setting methods
- Currently, kwargs validation for text properties only occurs when labels are explicitly set
- This leads to silent failures when users try to set tick labels through kwargs incorrectly
- The core issue appears to be in the axis handling code where ticks and labels are managed

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/axis.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
lib/matplotlib/artist.py
```

I selected these files because:
- `axis.py` is the primary file containing the tick and label handling logic
- `pyplot.py` provides the high-level interface for setting ticks and labels
- `artist.py` contains the base text property validation code that should be applied
