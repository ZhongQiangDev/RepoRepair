Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When `get_backend()` is called after creating a figure within an `rc_context`, it unexpectedly removes all figures from `Gcf.figs`
- This causes issues with figure management, like making `plt.close(fig2)` fail because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find the figure

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs specifically when the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created within an `rc_context`
- The problem seems related to how figure management interacts with the rc_context system
- Based on the workarounds (creating a figure before rc_context or using plt.ion()), it appears to be related to how figures are tracked when style/RC parameters are temporarily modified

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/style/core.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

I've selected these files because:
- `style/core.py` contains the `rc_context` implementation which is directly involved in the bug
- `pyplot.py` handles figure management and backend interactions, including the `get_backend()` function and figure tracking through `Gcf`

I'm limiting to these two files as they appear to be the most relevant to the core issue - the interaction between rc_context and figure management. While there might be other related files, these two would be the primary focus for fixing this bug.
