Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When saving a parent object (Order) after setting a child object (Product) with a non-numeric primary key, the foreign key field (product_id) is set to an empty string instead of the child's primary key value.
- This leads to a ForeignKeyViolation when the transaction commits since no product exists with an empty string as its primary key.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Django handles foreign key assignment when the related object is unsaved and has a non-numeric primary key.
- When the parent object tries to save after the child object is saved, Django isn't properly updating the foreign key reference with the newly saved child's primary key value.
- This seems to be a transaction and model state management issue, specifically around how foreign key fields track changes to their related objects' primary keys.

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files from the repository would be:

```
django/db/models/base.py
django/db/transaction.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/backends/base/base.py
django/db/models/manager.py
```

Reasoning:
- `django/db/models/base.py` is most important as it contains the core Model class which handles saving and state management
- `django/db/transaction.py` handles transaction management which is directly involved in this issue
- `django/db/models/fields/related.py` contains ForeignKey field implementation which is central to the problem
- `django/db/backends/base/base.py` handles database operations and transaction management at a lower level
- `django/db/models/manager.py` manages model operations which could affect how related objects are handled
