Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Django 3.2 alpha is raising models.W042 warnings about auto-created primary keys on models that inherit from other models
- These warnings shouldn't occur since the primary keys are already defined in the parent/ancestor models
- The warning suggests configuring DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting, which shouldn't be necessary for inherited primary keys

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a migration/model detection issue in Django 3.2
- The autodetector is not properly recognizing inherited primary keys
- The system is treating these fields as auto-created primary keys when they should be recognized as inherited fields
- The issue lies in how Django's migration system detects and handles model inheritance during the migration process

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/models/base.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- autodetector.py contains the core logic for detecting model changes and generating migrations
- base.py handles the fundamental model class behavior including inheritance
- migration.py manages how migrations are structured and executed
- operations/models.py and operations/fields.py handle specific model and field operations during migrations

The primary fix would likely need to be in the autodetector's logic for handling inherited fields, particularly primary keys.
