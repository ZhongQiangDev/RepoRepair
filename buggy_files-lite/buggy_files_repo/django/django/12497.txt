Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error hint suggests using incorrect parameters for ForeignKey:
`ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s")`
where `symmetrical` and `through` are actually ManyToManyField parameters, not ForeignKey parameters.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs when there are multiple ForeignKeys in an intermediary model without through_fields specified
- The hint message incorrectly suggests using ManyToManyField-specific parameters (`symmetrical` and `through`) with ForeignKey
- Additionally, `symmetrical=False` is noted as outdated since Django 3.0 for recursive relationships

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):

```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/models/manager.py
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py
django/core/serializers/base.py
```

Reasoning:
- `fields/related.py` is most important as it contains the core relationship field implementations including ForeignKey and ManyToManyField
- `manager.py` and `query.py` handle model relationships and queries
- `sql/datastructures.py` manages SQL join structures which are relevant for relationship handling
- `serializers/base.py` handles model serialization which can involve relationship fields
