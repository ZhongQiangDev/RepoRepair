Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- File permissions for uploaded files are inconsistent (0o600 vs expected 0o644)
- This happens specifically when using TemporaryUploadedFile for larger file uploads
- The issue occurs due to the tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence

2. Cause Analysis:
- The root cause is that Python's tempfile module explicitly sets 0o600 permissions for security
- When Django moves the temporary file to its final location using os.rename, these restrictive permissions are preserved
- There's no explicit permission setting in Django's file upload handling code to ensure consistent permissions
- This creates inconsistency between files handled in memory vs temporary files

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/core/files/uploadhandler.py
django/core/files/uploadedfile.py
django/core/files/storage.py
django/core/files/temp.py
django/core/files/base.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. uploadhandler.py contains the core upload handling logic and determines whether to use memory or temporary storage
2. uploadedfile.py defines the TemporaryUploadedFile class that's directly involved in the permission issue
3. storage.py manages file storage and could help enforce consistent permissions
4. temp.py handles temporary file creation and management
5. base.py provides foundational file handling functionality

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in uploadhandler.py or uploadedfile.py to ensure consistent permissions regardless of the upload method used.
