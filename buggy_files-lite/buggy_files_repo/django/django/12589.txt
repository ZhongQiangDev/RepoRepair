Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when trying to perform a GROUP BY operation with an annotated status field in Django 3.0.4. The query raises a "column reference 'status' is ambiguous" error, while it works correctly in Django 2.2.11.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how Django 3.0.4 handles GROUP BY clauses for annotated fields in SQL generation. In Django 2.2.11, the GROUP BY clause correctly references the subquery alias, but in 3.0.4, it's trying to reference the raw column name, causing ambiguity since 'status' exists in multiple contexts (both in the subquery and the main query).

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files for this GROUP BY clause handling issue:

```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/expressions.py
django/db/models/lookups.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- sql/compiler.py handles SQL generation including GROUP BY clauses
- sql/query.py manages query construction and annotation handling
- expressions.py contains core query expression handling
- lookups.py handles field lookups and references
- fields/related.py manages related field queries which are part of the example

The fix would likely need to modify how GROUP BY clauses are generated in the SQL compiler, particularly for annotated fields with subqueries.
