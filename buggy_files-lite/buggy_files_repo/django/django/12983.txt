Let me help analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `slugify()` function in Django is not stripping leading/trailing dashes and underscores. 
Current: `"___This is a test ---"` → `"___this-is-a-test-"`
Expected: `"___This is a test ---"` → `"this-is-a-test"`

2. Cause Analysis:
The `slugify()` function in Django's text utilities is not properly handling leading and trailing special characters (dashes and underscores) during the slug generation process. This appears to be a limitation in the text processing logic that should be removing these characters for cleaner URL-friendly slugs.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/utils/text.py
django/template/defaultfilters.py
django/utils/encoding.py
```

The `django/utils/text.py` is the primary file as it contains the core `slugify()` implementation. The `django/template/defaultfilters.py` likely contains template filters that use this function. The `django/utils/encoding.py` may be involved in character encoding/decoding during the slug generation process.
