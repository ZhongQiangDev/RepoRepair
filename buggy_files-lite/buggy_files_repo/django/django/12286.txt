Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When setting LANGUAGE_CODE to a sublanguage (e.g., "de-at") that isn't explicitly listed in LANGUAGES setting, Django raises translation.E004 error
- This contradicts Django's documented behavior which states it should fall back to the base language (e.g., "de") if available

2. Cause Analysis:
- The system check that raises translation.E004 is validating LANGUAGE_CODE against LANGUAGES setting too strictly
- It's not considering the language fallback mechanism where a sublanguage should be accepted if its base language is available
- The check needs to be modified to validate against base languages as well

3. Most relevant files (ordered by importance):
```
django/core/checks/translation.py
django/utils/translation/template.py
django/middleware/locale.py
```

Reasoning:
- `django/core/checks/translation.py` is the primary file containing the system check logic that raises the E004 error
- `django/utils/translation/template.py` contains core translation handling logic that would be involved in language code processing
- `django/middleware/locale.py` handles language selection and fallback mechanisms in Django's request/response cycle

These files would need to be modified to fix the validation logic while maintaining the correct fallback behavior.
