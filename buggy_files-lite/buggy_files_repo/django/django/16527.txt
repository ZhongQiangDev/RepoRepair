Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The "save as new" functionality in Django admin is accessible even when a user doesn't have add permission for the model. This is a security issue as users without add permission shouldn't be able to create new objects.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue is in the template tag logic that determines whether to show the "save as new" option. Currently, it only checks for:
- Not being in a popup
- Having change permission
- Being in change mode
- save_as being enabled

It's missing a crucial check for add permission, which should be required since "save as new" effectively creates a new object.

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py
django/contrib/admin/options.py
django/contrib/admin/models.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- admin_modify.py contains the template tag logic that needs to be fixed
- options.py contains the ModelAdmin class that handles permissions and form rendering
- models.py contains the base models for admin functionality including permission handling

The core fix needs to be in admin_modify.py where the template tag logic exists, while the other files provide the supporting infrastructure for permissions and admin functionality.
