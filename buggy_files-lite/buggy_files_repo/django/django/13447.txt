Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The app_list in the custom admin view contains serialized model data instead of providing access to the actual model class
- The _build_app_dict method is private but needs to be accessed by both index and app_index views

2. Cause Analysis:
- The admin site's app_list context data only includes serialized model information without reference to the original model class
- The _build_app_dict method's visibility is restricted despite being needed by multiple views
- This appears to be in Django's admin site implementation where the app dictionary building logic is encapsulated but needed more broadly

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/contrib/admin/sites.py
django/contrib/admin/options.py
django/contrib/admin/apps.py
django/db/models/base.py
django/apps/registry.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. sites.py - Contains the AdminSite class that builds and manages the app_list context
2. options.py - Handles ModelAdmin configuration and app dictionary building
3. apps.py - Manages admin app configuration and initialization
4. base.py - Core Model class implementation that would be referenced
5. registry.py - Handles app registration and model tracking

The main changes would need to be in sites.py to modify how app dictionaries are built and exposed in the context.
