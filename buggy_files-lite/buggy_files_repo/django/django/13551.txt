Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A password reset token remains valid even after a user changes their email address
- This is a security issue as the old email address (which may no longer be controlled by the user) can still be used to reset the password

2. Cause Analysis:
- The password reset token generation doesn't include the user's email address in the hash value
- When a user changes their email, the token should become invalid since it represents a significant account change
- The issue lies in the token generation/validation logic in Django's authentication system

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/contrib/auth/tokens.py
django/contrib/auth/forms.py
django/contrib/auth/views.py
```

Reasoning:
- `tokens.py` is the most critical as it contains the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class that needs to be modified to include email in the hash value
- `forms.py` contains the `PasswordResetForm` that handles the password reset workflow
- `views.py` contains the password reset views that coordinate the entire process

These files form the core of Django's password reset functionality, with `tokens.py` being the primary file needing modification to fix the security issue.
