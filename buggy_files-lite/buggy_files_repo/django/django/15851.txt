Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running `./manage.py dbshell -- -c "select * from some_table;"`, the `-c` option and SQL command are ignored by psql
- psql shows warnings that these arguments are being ignored
- The shell opens interactively instead of executing the command and exiting

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue is in the order of arguments being passed to psql
- psql requires all options (like -c) to come before the database name
- Currently, Django is placing the database name before the additional arguments, causing psql to ignore them
- The fix would involve reordering the arguments to ensure options come before the database name specifically for PostgreSQL

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
django/core/management/commands/dbshell.py
django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py
django/db/backends/base/introspection.py
django/core/management/base.py
django/db/backends/postgresql/base.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- dbshell.py contains the main command implementation that needs modification
- postgresql/client.py handles PostgreSQL-specific shell command construction
- base/introspection.py provides database inspection capabilities
- management/base.py contains base command functionality
- postgresql/base.py handles PostgreSQL-specific database operations

The fix would primarily involve modifying how arguments are ordered in dbshell.py and postgresql/client.py to ensure proper argument ordering for PostgreSQL.
