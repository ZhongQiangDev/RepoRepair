Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to a custom field that inherits from `BigAutoField`. The system incorrectly raises a `ValueError` stating that the primary key must subclass `AutoField`, even though `BigAutoField` is a valid auto field type.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the subclass checking logic for auto fields. The error message suggests that the validation is incorrectly requiring direct inheritance from `AutoField` instead of recognizing fields that inherit from `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField` as valid auto fields. This is likely a problem with the field type validation in Django's model options or base field handling.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files:

```
django/db/models/base.py
django/db/models/fields/mixins.py
django/db/models/options.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/utils/deconstruct.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `base.py` contains the core model functionality and field type validation
- `fields/mixins.py` handles field type inheritance and validation
- `options.py` would contain the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` validation logic
- `fields/related.py` deals with field relationships and inheritance
- `deconstruct.py` handles field serialization and type checking

The primary fix would likely need to be implemented in the model base or field mixins to properly handle the field inheritance checking.
