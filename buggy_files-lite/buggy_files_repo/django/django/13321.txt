Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When accessing any URL, the application crashes with a session decoding error
- The issue only occurs in Chrome browser, not Firefox
- This happens after upgrading to Django 3.1 on a staging server

2. Cause Analysis:
The error trace shows:
- There's an invalid/corrupted session data that can't be decoded
- The error occurs during session loading and decoding process
- The signature validation fails with "BadSignature" error
- The issue stems from an incompatibility between old session data and the new Django version

3. Most relevant files (ordered by importance):

```
django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py
django/contrib/sessions/middleware.py
django/core/signing.py
django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py
django/contrib/sessions/models.py
```

Reasoning:
- `backends/base.py` contains core session decoding logic where the error originates
- `middleware.py` handles session processing during requests where the crash occurs
- `signing.py` contains the signature validation code that's failing
- `backends/db.py` manages database session storage
- `models.py` defines the session model structure

The fix would primarily involve handling invalid session data gracefully in these files, particularly in the session decoding and signature validation processes.
