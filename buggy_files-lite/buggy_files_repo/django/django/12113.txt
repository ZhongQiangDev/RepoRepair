I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the cause.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue involves a database locking error when using persistent SQLite test databases with the `--keepdb` flag. Specifically, when running the `admin_views.test_multidb` test, it fails with:
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked
```

This happens when trying to use multiple test databases (in this case 'default' and 'other') with persistent SQLite files.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The error occurs because:
1. The test is using multiple SQLite databases ('default' and 'other')
2. With `--keepdb`, these databases are kept between test runs as files
3. The `admin_views.test_multidb` test is trying to access both databases
4. SQLite has a locking mechanism that prevents concurrent access to the same database file
5. The test is likely encountering a lock because both connections are trying to access or modify the databases simultaneously

The issue is specifically related to how Django manages SQLite test databases in a multi-database configuration when using the `--keepdb` option.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py
django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py
django/test/testcases.py
django/db/transaction.py
django/db/backends/base/creation.py
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` - Contains the SQLite database wrapper implementation, including connection handling which is central to the locking issue.

2. `django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py` - Manages the creation and configuration of SQLite test databases, including how persistent test databases are handled with `--keepdb`.

3. `django/test/testcases.py` - Contains the test case framework that sets up test databases, including handling of multiple databases in tests like `admin_views.test_multidb`.

4. `django/db/transaction.py` - Manages database transactions, which could be involved in the locking issue if transactions aren't being properly closed.

5. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - The base class for database creation that defines how test databases are created and managed across different database backends.
