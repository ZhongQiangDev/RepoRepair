Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]))`, the query breaks and generates invalid SQL: `SELECT AS "foo" FROM "table"`
- The normal case `ExpressionWrapper(Q(pk__in=[]))` works fine and generates valid SQL: `SELECT 0 AS "foo" FROM "table"`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how negation (`~`) of Q objects is handled within ExpressionWrapper
- When an empty list is used with `pk__in`, it should generate appropriate SQL for both normal and negated cases
- The SQL generation is failing to properly handle the negated case, resulting in missing values in the SELECT clause

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue (SQL generation for expressions), here are the most relevant files:

```
django/db/models/expressions.py
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/sql/where.py
django/db/models/aggregates.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. expressions.py contains the ExpressionWrapper class and core expression handling
2. compiler.py handles SQL generation and compilation
3. query.py manages Q objects and query construction
4. where.py handles WHERE clause generation including negation
5. aggregates.py provides support for aggregate expressions which may interact with ExpressionWrapper
