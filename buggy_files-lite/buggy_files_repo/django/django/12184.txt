Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- An optional URL parameter in the URLConf pattern is causing a TypeError when calling the view function
- The error indicates the view function is receiving 3 positional arguments when it expects 1-2 arguments
- This worked in Django 2.2 but breaks in Django 3.0

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how Django handles optional URL parameters in its URL routing system
- The error suggests Django 3.0 changed how it passes URL parameters to view functions
- The view function expects `request` and an optional `format` parameter, but is receiving an additional unexpected argument
- This is likely a change in how Django's URL resolver handles optional parameters and passes them to view functions

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
django/urls/resolvers.py
django/urls/conf.py
django/core/handlers/base.py
django/urls/base.py
django/core/checks/urls.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `resolvers.py` contains the core URL resolution logic and pattern matching
- `conf.py` handles URL configuration and pattern processing
- `handlers/base.py` manages the request handling pipeline and view function calling
- `urls/base.py` provides core URL handling utilities
- `checks/urls.py` contains URL validation and checking logic

The primary issue likely lies in the URL resolver's handling of optional parameters, making `resolvers.py` and `conf.py` the most critical files for this bug.
