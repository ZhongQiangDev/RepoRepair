Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When DEBUG=True and Http404 is raised in a path converter's to_python method, instead of showing a detailed technical 404 response, it shows a generic error message: "A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator."

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Django handles Http404 exceptions specifically within path converters
- When DEBUG=True, Django should show detailed technical 404 pages
- The current behavior suggests the Http404 exception is being caught and converted to a generic server error instead of being handled properly as a 404 response
- This likely involves the interaction between URL resolution, exception handling middleware, and debug views

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):
```
django/urls/resolvers.py
django/core/handlers/exception.py
django/views/debug.py
django/http/response.py
django/core/exceptions.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- django/urls/resolvers.py: Contains the core URL resolution logic and path converter handling
- django/core/handlers/exception.py: Handles exception processing in Django's request/response cycle
- django/views/debug.py: Responsible for generating debug pages when DEBUG=True
- django/http/response.py: Contains Http404 and response classes
- django/core/exceptions.py: Contains core Django exceptions and their handling logic
