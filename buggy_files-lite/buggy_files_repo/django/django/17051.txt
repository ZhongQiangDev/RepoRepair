Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `bulk_create` with `update_conflicts=True`, the primary keys (IDs) are not returned in the resulting queryset
- The SQL query generated lacks the `RETURNING my_model.id` clause, which would return the IDs

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the query generation logic in Django's ORM
- The `returning_fields` get removed even when using `update_conflicts=True`
- While this makes sense for `ignore_conflicts` (as PostgreSQL won't return IDs for ignored rows), it's unnecessary for `update_conflicts`
- The core issue appears to be in the PostgreSQL backend's query generation and bulk operation handling

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/backends/postgresql/base.py
django/db/backends/base/base.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `query.py` contains the core QuerySet implementation including bulk operations
2. `postgresql/base.py` handles PostgreSQL-specific query generation and execution
3. `base/base.py` provides the foundational database wrapper functionality
4. `fields/related.py` handles field relationships which may affect bulk operations
5. `postgresql/operations.py` contains PostgreSQL-specific operations that could influence query generation

The fix would likely need to modify the query generation logic to retain the `RETURNING` clause when `update_conflicts=True` is specified.
