Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The syndication framework doesn't support direct setting of item_comments through feed.add_item()
- Users have to use item_extra_kwargs as a workaround to set comments
- Comments functionality is mentioned in feedparser but not implemented in the view

2. Cause Analysis:
- The syndication views (specifically Feed class) doesn't have a direct parameter for comments in add_item()
- The feedgenerator implementation should support comments but the view layer doesn't expose this functionality
- The connection between feedparser and view implementation is incomplete for comments support

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/contrib/syndication/views.py
django/utils/feedgenerator.py
django/contrib/syndication/apps.py
```

The first file is most important as it contains the Feed class where add_item() needs to be modified. The second file contains the actual feed generation logic where comments support would need to be implemented if not already present. The third file is the app configuration that might need updates for new functionality.
