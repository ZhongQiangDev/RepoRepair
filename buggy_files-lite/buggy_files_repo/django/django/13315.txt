Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `limit_choices_to` with a Q object on a ForeignKey field that involves a join, duplicate options appear in the form field's choices

2. Cause Analysis:
- This likely occurs because the query with joins is not properly handling distinct values when filtering choices
- When using Q objects with joins, the underlying SQL query may produce duplicate rows which aren't being properly deduplicated before being converted to form field choices
- This is primarily a form field/widget issue since it relates to how choices are rendered in forms, specifically with ForeignKey fields

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files would be those handling model field choices, form fields for foreign keys, and related field widgets. Based on the repository information:

```
django/forms/models.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/forms/widgets.py
django/db/models/query.py
django/forms/formsets.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `forms/models.py` contains ModelChoiceField which handles choice generation for foreign keys
- `fields/related.py` contains the ForeignKey field implementation where limit_choices_to is defined
- `forms/widgets.py` handles the actual rendering of choices in forms
- `models/query.py` handles the queryset filtering and joins
- `forms/formsets.py` provides additional context for form field handling
