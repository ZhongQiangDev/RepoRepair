Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When trying to delete an index_together on fields that also have unique_together constraint, the migration crashes
- The error occurs in django/db/backends/base/schema.py with ValueError indicating it found wrong number (2) of constraints

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue happens because when trying to delete a composed index (index_together), the schema editor finds both:
  - The index from index_together (_idx)
  - The implicit index created by unique_together (_uniq)
- The schema editor's _delete_composed_index() method expects to find only one constraint but finds two, causing it to fail
- This is primarily a schema editor issue in handling the overlap between unique constraints and indexes

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/backends/base/schema.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. schema.py contains the actual failing code in _delete_composed_index()
2. operations/models.py handles model-level operations including AlterIndexTogether and AlterUniqueTogether
3. autodetector.py detects and generates the migration operations
4. executor.py handles the execution of migrations
5. migration.py provides the base Migration class structure
