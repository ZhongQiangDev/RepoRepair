Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a ManyToManyField is defined with symmetrical=True or is self-referential, developers can still specify a related_name even though it won't be used
- This leads to confusion since the related field on the target model is not created in these cases

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from Django's ManyToManyField implementation not validating/preventing related_name usage when symmetrical relationships are defined
- Currently, there's no validation check to raise an error when a developer tries to use related_name with symmetrical=True
- This is primarily a validation issue in the field definition and checks system

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/core/serializers/base.py
django/db/models/constraints.py
django/forms/models.py
django/db/models/deletion.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `django/db/models/fields/related.py` is most important as it contains the ManyToManyField class definition and field validation logic
- `django/core/serializers/base.py` handles field serialization which could be affected by field relationship configurations
- `django/db/models/constraints.py` deals with field constraints and validations
- `django/forms/models.py` handles model form generation which interacts with field definitions
- `django/db/models/deletion.py` manages relationship deletions and could be affected by symmetrical relationships

The fix would primarily need to be implemented in the ManyToManyField class validation logic within `fields/related.py`.
