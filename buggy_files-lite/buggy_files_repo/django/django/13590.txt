Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When passing named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters in Django 3.0, it raises a TypeError stating "__new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'"
- This worked fine in Django 2.2 but breaks in 3.0

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs in the Query.resolve_lookup_value method
- When resolving lookups, it processes tuple elements and tries to reconstruct the tuple
- The method preserves the tuple type (named tuple) but passes an iterator to its constructor
- Named tuples don't support construction from iterators directly, requiring explicit positional arguments
- This causes the TypeError when trying to reconstruct the named tuple

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information and the cause analysis, here are the most relevant files:

```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/lookups.py
django/db/models/utils.py
django/db/migrations/operations/utils.py
django/utils/deconstruct.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- query.py contains the Query class where the resolve_lookup_value method resides
- lookups.py handles lookup value processing and transformations
- models/utils.py likely contains tuple handling utilities
- operations/utils.py includes ModelTuple handling which is related to tuple processing
- deconstruct.py handles object reconstruction which is relevant to the tuple reconstruction issue
