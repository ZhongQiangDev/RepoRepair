Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in Django admin has a label with a 'for' attribute
- This 'for' attribute points to a non-labelable element
- The widget only renders text, not an input element
- HTML labels with 'for' attributes should only point to form controls that can be labeled

2. Cause Analysis:
- The `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is rendering read-only text content rather than an actual form input
- However, it's still being treated as a labelable form element in the template rendering
- The core issue lies in how the widget is implemented and how it interacts with Django's form field labeling system
- The widget should either not generate a 'for' attribute in its label, or provide a proper form control to label

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/contrib/auth/forms.py
django/forms/boundfield.py
django/forms/widgets.py
django/contrib/admin/widgets.py
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `auth/forms.py` contains the actual `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` implementation
2. `forms/boundfield.py` handles form field binding and label generation
3. `forms/widgets.py` contains the base widget classes and rendering logic
4. `admin/widgets.py` contains admin-specific widget implementations that might affect the behavior
5. `admin/helpers.py` provides helper functions for admin form rendering
