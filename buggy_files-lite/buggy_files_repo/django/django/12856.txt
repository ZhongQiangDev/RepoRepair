Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using UniqueConstraint in a model, makemigrations doesn't validate whether the specified fields actually exist in the model
- This contrasts with the older unique_together syntax which properly raises models.E012 error when fields don't exist

2. Cause Analysis:
- The validation check for field existence is missing in the UniqueConstraint implementation
- While unique_together has field validation built in, this validation was not carried over when UniqueConstraint was implemented
- The issue likely lies in the constraints and migration validation code paths

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/db/models/constraints.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
django/db/models/base.py
```

Reasoning:
- constraints.py contains the UniqueConstraint class implementation where field validation should occur
- operations/models.py handles model operations including constraint changes during migrations
- autodetector.py detects model changes and validates migrations
- makemigrations.py is the command that should trigger field validation
- base.py contains core model functionality that interacts with constraints
