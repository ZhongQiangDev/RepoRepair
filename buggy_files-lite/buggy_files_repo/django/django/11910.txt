Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When renaming a primary key field in ModelA from 'field_wrong' to 'field_fixed'
- The ForeignKey in ModelB still references the old field name ('field_wrong') instead of updating to the new name ('field_fixed')
- This causes issues with the to_field parameter in the migration

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the migration generation system
- When detecting renamed fields, especially primary keys that are referenced by foreign keys
- The autodetector needs to properly update foreign key references when the target field is renamed
- The migration operation needs to handle both the field rename and updating any foreign key references

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
```

The autodetector.py is most important as it handles detecting field renames and generating appropriate migrations. operations/fields.py contains the RenameField operation implementation. migration.py handles the core migration logic, while executor.py manages migration execution. operations/models.py contains model-level operations that might need to be coordinated with field renames.
