Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When creating a model instance with a CharField/IntegerField using TextChoices/IntegerChoices, the value returned by the field's getter is returning the enum value (e.g. 'MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE') instead of the actual string value ('first').
- The test expects str(my_object.my_str_value) to return 'first' but gets 'MyChoice.FIRST_CHOICE' instead.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how Django handles the string representation of enum choices in model fields
- The problem likely stems from either:
  a) The model field descriptor not properly converting the enum value to its string representation
  b) The enum choices implementation not properly handling string conversion
- Since this involves model fields and choices, we need to look at the core Django files handling these components

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
django/db/models/enums.py
django/db/models/fields/proxy.py
django/forms/fields.py
django/db/models/options.py
django/forms/models.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `django/db/models/enums.py` is most important as it directly handles TextChoices/IntegerChoices implementation
- `django/db/models/fields/proxy.py` handles field descriptor behavior which affects how values are returned
- `django/forms/fields.py` contains field implementations that may affect choice handling
- `django/db/models/options.py` manages model metadata including choices
- `django/forms/models.py` handles model form integration which could affect choice field behavior
