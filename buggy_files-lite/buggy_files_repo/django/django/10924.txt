Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The FilePathField's path parameter is being set with a computed value (os.path.join) during model definition
- This causes the path to be evaluated and hardcoded at migration creation time based on the local machine's configuration
- When running migrations on other machines (e.g. production), the hardcoded path doesn't match the actual filesystem paths

2. Cause Analysis:
- FilePathField doesn't support callable/dynamic paths
- The path value gets evaluated and serialized into the migration file when makemigrations runs
- There's no mechanism to defer path evaluation until runtime when migrations are applied
- This is primarily a limitation in how Django serializes field configurations into migrations

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):

```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
django/core/files/storage.py
django/db/migrations/writer.py
django/core/files/uploadedfile.py
django/forms/models.py
```

Rationale for file selection:
- migrations/serializer.py: Handles how field configurations are serialized into migrations
- files/storage.py: Contains core file handling and path resolution logic
- migrations/writer.py: Manages how migrations are written to files
- files/uploadedfile.py: Implements file upload handling and path processing
- forms/models.py: Contains model form field definitions and validation

The primary fix would likely need to be implemented in the serializer.py to allow for dynamic/callable paths to be properly handled during migration creation and application.
