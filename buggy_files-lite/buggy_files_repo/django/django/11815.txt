I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the cause.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue involves Django migrations incorrectly handling Enum objects used as default values for CharField. When an Enum object with a translated value is used as a default, the migration stores the translated value itself (`Status('Good')`) rather than the Enum name (`Status['GOOD']`). This causes errors when translations change, as the stored value no longer matches any Enum value.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The root cause appears to be in how Django's migration system serializes Enum objects. When an Enum with translated values is used as a default value, the serializer is capturing the value of the Enum object instead of its name. This is problematic because:
1. The value can change with translations
2. The serialized migration references the value directly
3. When migrations run in a different language context, the value doesn't match any Enum member

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
django/db/migrations/writer.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/utils/deconstruct.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
```

The issue is most likely in the `EnumSerializer` class within `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`, which is responsible for serializing Enum values. The current implementation appears to be using the Enum's value instead of its name when generating migration files. The other files support the migration generation process, with the writer handling the actual file creation, the autodetector identifying model changes, and the deconstruct utility preparing objects for serialization.
