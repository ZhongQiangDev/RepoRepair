Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `Exists(Product.objects.all()) & Q()` works correctly
- `Q() & Exists(Product.objects.all())` raises a TypeError
- The & (AND) operator is not commutative between Q and Exists objects as it should be

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` where Q.__and__ method checks if the other operand is a Q object
- If not a Q object, it raises TypeError
- The issue is that while Exists objects can handle Q objects on their right side, Q objects don't know how to handle Exists objects on their right side
- This suggests missing `__rand__` implementation for proper commutative behavior

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/db/models/expressions.py
django/db/models/query_utils.py
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. expressions.py contains the Exists class implementation
2. query_utils.py contains the Q class where the error occurs
3. query.py handles how queries are constructed and combined
4. datastructures.py provides core structures for query building
5. related.py may be involved as Exists often deals with related field queries
