Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When rendering a formset's empty_form with form_kwargs containing empty_permitted parameter, a KeyError occurs. This happens because empty_form tries to access empty_permitted from form_kwargs but it's not properly handled.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from how form_kwargs is handled when creating the empty_form in formsets. The empty_form is meant to be a template for adding new forms dynamically, but it's incorrectly trying to use empty_permitted from form_kwargs, which isn't relevant for an empty template form since it won't be validated.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/forms/formsets.py
django/forms/models.py
django/forms/forms.py
```

Reasoning:
- `django/forms/formsets.py` is the primary file as it contains the BaseFormSet class which handles empty_form generation and form_kwargs management
- `django/forms/models.py` is relevant as it contains ModelFormSet implementations that extend the base formset functionality
- `django/forms/forms.py` would contain the base Form class that handles the empty_permitted parameter

The fix would likely need to be implemented in formsets.py to properly handle form_kwargs when generating empty_form instances.
