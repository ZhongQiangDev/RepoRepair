Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Currently there is no validation to ensure that a Field's max_length is large enough to accommodate the longest value defined in its choices list
- This can lead to database errors when trying to save a record with a choice value that exceeds the field's max_length

2. Cause Analysis:
- Django's field validation system needs to check that any choice value defined for a field can fit within the field's max_length constraint
- This validation should happen when the field is defined/configured, not when data is being saved
- The validation logic would need to compare the length of each choice value against the field's max_length

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):

```
django/core/validators.py
django/forms/fields.py
django/db/models/fields.py
django/contrib/admin/checks.py
django/forms/models.py
```

Reasoning:
- django/core/validators.py contains the core validation logic including MaxLengthValidator
- django/forms/fields.py handles form field validation including ChoiceField implementations
- django/db/models/fields.py defines model field types and their validation
- django/contrib/admin/checks.py contains system checks for the admin interface
- django/forms/models.py handles model form validation which often deals with choices

The fix would likely need to add validation logic in these files to ensure choice values don't exceed max_length constraints.
