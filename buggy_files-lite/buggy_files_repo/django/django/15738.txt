I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the cause.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior

The issue involves a migration problem when changing a field from a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField while also removing a unique_together constraint. The error message is:

```
ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)
```

The user discovered that splitting the migration into two steps works: first removing the unique_together constraint, then changing the field type.

## 2. Analyzing the cause

The problem occurs because:
1. The unique_together constraint includes the field being changed (project_data_set)
2. When changing from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField, Django's migration system is trying to handle both:
   - Changing the field type (which creates a new table for the M2M relationship)
   - Removing the unique_together constraint
3. The migration system is expecting to find the constraint on the old field during the migration process, but the constraint can't exist on a ManyToManyField

This is a sequencing issue in how Django's migration autodetector and executor handle changes to fields that are part of unique_together constraints.

## 3. Files most related to the cause

```
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `autodetector.py` is responsible for detecting changes between model states and generating appropriate migration operations. It's likely failing to properly sequence the operations when a field is both changing type and being removed from a unique constraint.

2. `operations/models.py` contains the `AlterUniqueTogether` operation that handles changes to unique_together constraints.

3. `migration.py` defines the core Migration class that manages how operations are applied and dependencies are resolved.

4. `executor.py` handles the actual execution of migrations, including validating that constraints exist as expected.

5. `operations/fields.py` defines operations for field changes, including the `AddField` and `AlterField` operations that would be involved in changing from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField.
