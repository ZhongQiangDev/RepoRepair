Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When filtering ProductMetaData with a metadata_type that has a field named "filterable", Django raises a NotSupportedError stating "ProductMetaDataType is disallowed in the filter clause"
- The error occurs specifically because one of the model fields is named "filterable"

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from Django's query builder interpreting the field name "filterable" as a special keyword
- In Django's SQL query construction, there appears to be a check that prevents fields named "filterable" from being used in filter clauses
- This is likely a naming conflict where Django's internal query builder is confusing the field name with a property or method used for determining if an object can be filtered

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the error trace, here are the most relevant files:

```
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/models/manager.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `query.py` contains the core SQL query building logic where the NotSupportedError is raised
- `datastructures.py` defines the base structures used in SQL query building
- `related.py` handles field relationships which are involved in the filtering process
- `query.py` manages the QuerySet operations that lead to filter execution
- `manager.py` provides the high-level interface for model querying
