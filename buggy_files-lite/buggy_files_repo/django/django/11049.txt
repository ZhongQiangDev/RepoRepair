Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When entering "14:00" into a DurationField, it translates to "00:14:00" (14 minutes)
- The error message incorrectly states the format should be "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]"
- The actual expected format should be "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]" since seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided

2. Cause Analysis:
- This is primarily a documentation/validation issue in Django's DurationField
- The error message format string is incorrect and doesn't match the actual parsing behavior
- The issue lies in how Django validates and parses duration inputs, particularly in the forms and fields handling

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/forms/fields.py
django/utils/duration.py
django/db/models/fields.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- forms/fields.py contains the form field validation logic and error messages
- utils/duration.py handles duration parsing and formatting
- db/models/fields.py contains the DurationField model field definition

I limited to 3 files since these would be the core files needed to fix both the validation behavior and error message for DurationField.
