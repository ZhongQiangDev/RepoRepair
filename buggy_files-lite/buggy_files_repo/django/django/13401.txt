Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that when getting fields from two different model classes (B and C) that inherit from the same abstract model (A), the fields are considered equal and get deduplicated when put into a set, even though they belong to different models.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in how Django compares model fields for equality. Currently, fields only consider their creation_counter when comparing for equality, ignoring which model they belong to. This leads to fields from different models being considered equal if they have the same creation counter, which is incorrect behavior for fields inherited from abstract models.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue, ordered by importance:

```
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/models/fields/proxy.py
django/db/models/base.py
django/db/models/lookups.py
django/db/models/sql/query.py
```

The field comparison logic would primarily be in these files, with fields/related.py being most important as it handles field relationships and comparisons. fields/proxy.py and base.py contain core field functionality, while lookups.py and query.py handle how fields are used in queries and comparisons.
