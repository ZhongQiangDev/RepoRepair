Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that Django's SimpleLazyObject doesn't implement the `__radd__` magic method, which is needed for reverse addition operations. This causes problems when attempting to add a non-lazy object to a lazy object from the right side.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is in Django's lazy object implementation. While it implements many magic methods for operations, it's missing `__radd__` which is needed for reverse addition (when the lazy object is on the right side of the + operator). The current implementation can handle `lazy_obj + other` but not `other + lazy_obj`.

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/utils/functional.py
django/utils/text.py
django/utils/datastructures.py
django/utils/html.py
django/utils/safestring.py
```

Reasoning:
- `django/utils/functional.py` is the primary file containing lazy object implementations
- `django/utils/text.py` contains text manipulation utilities that often work with lazy objects
- `django/utils/datastructures.py` contains core data structure implementations that may interact with lazy objects
- `django/utils/html.py` and `django/utils/safestring.py` deal with string operations and safe string handling, which commonly use lazy evaluation

The fix would primarily need to be implemented in `functional.py` where the lazy object implementation resides.
