Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `ModelChoiceField` does not show the invalid choice value when raising a validation error
- This contrasts with `ChoiceField` which does include the invalid value in its error message
- The error message is less helpful for debugging without the actual invalid value

2. Cause Analysis:
- Looking at the code, `ModelChoiceField` inherits from `ChoiceField` but doesn't pass the invalid value parameter when raising the validation error
- The error message template exists in `default_error_messages` with placeholder `%(value)s` but the value isn't being passed
- This is likely a validation handling issue in the form fields implementation

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/forms/models.py
django/forms/fields.py
django/core/exceptions.py
django/db/models/fields/mixins.py
django/forms/widgets.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `django/forms/models.py` contains `ModelChoiceField` implementation which is central to the issue
- `django/forms/fields.py` contains the base `ChoiceField` that `ModelChoiceField` inherits from
- `django/core/exceptions.py` would contain the `ValidationError` handling
- `django/db/models/fields/mixins.py` contains field mixins that might affect validation behavior
- `django/forms/widgets.py` handles the form field rendering and could be involved in error display

The first two files are most critical as they directly contain the field implementations where the validation error handling needs to be fixed.
