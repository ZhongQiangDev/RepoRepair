Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when using `method_decorator` with a function decorator that uses `@wraps`. The decorated method raises an AttributeError because the function being passed to the decorator is a partial object that lacks expected function attributes like `__name__` and `__module__`.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that Django's `method_decorator` is not properly preserving or transferring function attributes when converting a function decorator to a method decorator. When the decorator tries to access attributes like `__name__` on the wrapped function, it fails because it's dealing with a `functools.partial` object instead of a regular function.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/utils/decorators.py
django/core/management/base.py
django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
django/views/decorators/http.py
django/views/decorators/csrf.py
```

The `decorators.py` file is most critical as it likely contains the `method_decorator` implementation. The other files are relevant as they contain decorator-related code and patterns that could influence or be affected by the decorator behavior. The management and dispatcher files likely contain examples of decorator usage that could help understand the context, while the HTTP and CSRF decorator files show similar patterns of method decoration in Django.
