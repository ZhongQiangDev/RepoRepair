I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The issue involves Django's auto-reloading with StatReloader intermittently throwing a "ValueError: embedded null byte" error. This happens during the auto-reload process when Django is monitoring files for changes. The error occurs specifically in the path resolution process within Python's pathlib module.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
Looking at the traceback, the error happens in:
- `django/utils/autoreload.py` during the file watching process
- Specifically in the `snapshot_files()` and `watched_files()` methods of the `StatReloader` class
- The error is triggered when calling `path.resolve().absolute()` on a path
- The underlying issue occurs in Python's pathlib when calling `os.readlink(path)` on a path that contains a null byte

The error seems to occur when Django's auto-reloader is scanning file system paths. When it encounters a path with an embedded null byte (possibly from a mounted network share or a corrupted file system entry), Python's pathlib fails to handle it properly.

## 3. Files most related to the cause

```
django/utils/autoreload.py
django/core/management/commands/runserver.py
django/core/servers/basehttp.py
django/core/management/base.py
django/core/handlers/wsgi.py
```

The `django/utils/autoreload.py` file is the most important as it contains the `StatReloader` class where the error occurs during path resolution. The `runserver.py` command invokes the auto-reloader. The `basehttp.py` file is responsible for the server implementation that uses the auto-reloader. The `base.py` file contains the command execution framework, and `wsgi.py` handles the request processing that's wrapped by the auto-reloading functionality.
