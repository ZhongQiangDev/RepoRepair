Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The test runner crashes when trying to set up test databases with the new Django 3.1 setting "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False}. Specifically, it fails with a "relation django_admin_log does not exist" error, indicating it's trying to access tables that haven't been created.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs during database serialization in the test setup phase. Even though migrations are disabled with MIGRATE: False, Django is still trying to serialize the database state but the required tables don't exist because migrations weren't run. This suggests a conflict between the new no-migration setting and Django's test database serialization logic.

3. Most Related Files:
The key files involved in test database setup, serialization, and migration handling would be:

```
django/test/utils.py
django/db/backends/base/creation.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/test/runner.py
django/db/migrations/loader.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. test/utils.py handles core test database setup and serialization
2. backends/base/creation.py manages test database creation and serialization
3. migrations/executor.py controls migration execution and state
4. test/runner.py orchestrates the overall test process
5. migrations/loader.py loads and manages migration files

The issue likely needs to be fixed in the interaction between these components to properly handle the MIGRATE: False setting during test database setup.
