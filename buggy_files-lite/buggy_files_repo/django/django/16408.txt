Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The test case shows that when using a multi-level FilteredRelation with select_related(), the related object is incorrectly set. Specifically, p[0].tournament_pool.tournament is returning a PoolStyle object instead of the expected Tournament object.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how Django handles nested relations when combining FilteredRelation with select_related(). The problem occurs because:
- FilteredRelation creates a new relation path 'pool__tournament__pool'
- select_related() is trying to follow this path but incorrectly maps the objects
- The wrong object type is being assigned during the related object population phase

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, these are the most relevant files:

```
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/models/lookups.py
django/db/models/sql/datastructures.py
```

Reasoning for selection:
- query.py: Contains core QuerySet functionality and handles select_related() operations
- compiler.py: Responsible for SQL generation and result processing
- related.py: Manages relationship fields and their behavior
- lookups.py: Handles FilteredRelation and field lookups
- datastructures.py: Contains JOIN and table structures used in query compilation

These files are most likely to contain the code responsible for handling related object population and the interaction between FilteredRelation and select_related().
