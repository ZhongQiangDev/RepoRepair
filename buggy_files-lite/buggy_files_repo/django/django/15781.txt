Let me help analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The help text formatting in the command output is incorrect - it's displaying the multi-line help text as a single line without preserving the indentation and line breaks from the docstring.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be with how Django's command system handles multi-line help text in command classes. The help text defined with triple quotes and indentation is not being preserved when displayed through the help command. This suggests the command formatter is not properly handling the text formatting and indentation from docstrings/help attributes.

3. Most Relevant Files:
The files most directly related to handling command help text formatting would be:

```
django/core/management/base.py
django/core/management/commands/help.py
django/core/management/commands/runserver.py
```

The `base.py` file is most important as it contains the core command handling and help text formatting logic. This is where the `BaseCommand` class and help formatter classes are defined.

The `help.py` command file would be second most relevant as it handles displaying command help text.

The `runserver.py` command serves as a reference implementation of a command with formatted help text, making it a useful example for comparison.

These files would need to be modified to properly preserve and display multi-line help text formatting from command docstrings.
