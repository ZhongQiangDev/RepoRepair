Let me help analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `join` filter in Django templates is escaping the joining string (`some_var`) even when `autoescape off` is explicitly set. This is unexpected because when `autoescape off` is used, no HTML escaping should occur for any part of the expression.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the `join` filter handles the joining string versus the list items. While the list items correctly respect the `autoescape off` directive, the joining string is being forcibly escaped regardless of the autoescape context. This suggests the join filter's implementation isn't properly considering the template's autoescape context when processing the joining string.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/template/defaultfilters.py
django/template/base.py
django/utils/html.py
django/utils/safestring.py
django/template/defaulttags.py
```

Reasoning:
- `defaultfilters.py` contains the implementation of the `join` filter itself
- `base.py` contains core template processing logic including autoescaping context
- `html.py` contains HTML escaping utilities used by filters
- `safestring.py` contains classes for handling safe strings and escaping
- `defaulttags.py` contains related template processing logic that may interact with filters

The fix would likely need to be made primarily in `defaultfilters.py` to make the `join` filter properly respect the template's autoescape context for both the list items and the joining string.
