Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `ResolverMatch.__repr__()` method doesn't properly handle cases where the view is a `functools.partial()` function. Instead of showing useful information about the underlying function and its arguments, it just displays "functools.partial" which isn't helpful for debugging or understanding the view.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from how `ResolverMatch` handles function representation in its `__repr__` method. When a partial function is passed as a view, the standard representation doesn't unwrap the partial to show the base function and pre-applied arguments. This needs to be handled in `ResolverMatch.__init__()` to properly extract and store information about partial functions.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/urls/resolvers.py
django/urls/base.py
django/urls/conf.py
django/urls/exceptions.py
django/urls/utils.py
```

The `resolvers.py` file is most important as it contains the `ResolverMatch` class that needs modification. The other URL-related files are relevant as they work together in the URL resolution system and may need to be considered for compatibility when fixing the issue.
