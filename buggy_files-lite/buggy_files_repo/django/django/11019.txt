Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When merging 3 or more media objects with dependencies (text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js), Django incorrectly orders the files and raises unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings.
- The final result shows files in wrong order: text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js, text-editor.js
- This is problematic because text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but appears before it.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs during the media merging process when handling multiple widgets' media.
- The order constraint is wrongly imposed when ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media is processed, forcing color-picker.js to appear before text-editor.js.
- The media merging logic doesn't properly handle transitive dependencies or maintain correct ordering when combining multiple media objects.

3. Most Related Files:
The key files that would need to be modified to fix this issue are:

```
django/forms/widgets.py
django/forms/media.py
django/forms/models.py
django/forms/renderers.py
django/forms/fields.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- widgets.py contains the core Media class and widget implementations that handle media ordering
- media.py would handle the media merging logic and dependency resolution
- models.py contains ModelForm which uses these widgets and their media
- renderers.py handles how the media is rendered
- fields.py contains form fields that use these widgets

The main fix would likely need to be in widgets.py to properly handle media ordering and dependencies when merging multiple widget media objects.
