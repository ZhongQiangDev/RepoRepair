Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When RenameIndex() operation is applied backwards and then forwards again, it crashes with "relation already exists" error on PostgreSQL
- This occurs specifically when dealing with an unnamed index for unique_together constraints

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how RenameIndex handles the restoration of auto-generated names for unnamed indexes
- When moving backward, it's not properly restoring the original auto-generated name
- When moving forward again, it tries to create an index with a name that already exists in the database
- This is specifically a problem with PostgreSQL's handling of index names and uniqueness constraints

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files for this issue would be:

```
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
django/db/models/indexes.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. operations/models.py contains the core operations for model changes including index operations
2. executor.py handles the execution of migrations including forward/backward operations
3. postgresql/schema.py contains PostgreSQL-specific schema operations including index handling
4. migration.py defines the base Migration class that handles state transitions
5. indexes.py contains the base Index class implementation

The core issue likely needs to be fixed in how RenameIndex operation in operations/models.py handles the restoration of auto-generated names during backward operations, particularly for PostgreSQL databases.
