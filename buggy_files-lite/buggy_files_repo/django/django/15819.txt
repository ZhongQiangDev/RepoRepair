Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `inspectdb` command generates Django models from existing database tables, but when there are multiple foreign key relationships to the same model, it fails to automatically generate unique `related_name` attributes, causing reverse accessor naming conflicts.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue occurs because when `inspectdb` creates model fields for foreign key relationships pointing to the same model, it doesn't automatically generate unique `related_name` values for each relationship. This leads to Django's field validation error (E304) due to conflicting reverse accessors.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py
django/db/models/fields/related.py
django/db/backends/base/introspection.py
django/db/backends/mysql/introspection.py
django/db/backends/sqlite3/introspection.py
```

The `inspectdb.py` is the primary file that needs modification as it handles the model generation logic. The `related.py` contains the relationship field definitions that need unique related names. The introspection files provide the database inspection functionality that feeds into the model generation process.
