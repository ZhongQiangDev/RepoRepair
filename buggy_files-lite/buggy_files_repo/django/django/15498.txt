Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that empty strings in the If-Modified-Since header used to be ignored but now raise an exception since commit d6aff369ad3. This is a regression in behavior.

2. Cause Analysis:
The If-Modified-Since header is used in HTTP caching to determine if a resource has been modified. When empty, it should be ignored rather than causing an exception. This likely involves:
- HTTP request/response handling
- Caching middleware
- Date/time parsing for modification checks
- Header validation

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository files, these are most relevant to handling If-Modified-Since headers and conditional requests, ordered by importance:

```
django/utils/http.py
django/middleware/http.py
django/views/static.py
django/utils/cache.py
django/views/decorators/http.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- django/utils/http.py handles HTTP header parsing and validation
- django/middleware/http.py contains ConditionalGetMiddleware which processes If-Modified-Since headers
- django/views/static.py implements static file serving with modification time checks
- django/utils/cache.py handles HTTP caching headers
- django/views/decorators/http.py provides decorators for conditional request handling

The core issue likely lies in the header parsing logic in django/utils/http.py or the conditional request handling in django/middleware/http.py.
