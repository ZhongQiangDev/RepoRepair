Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Currently, it's difficult to add custom data attributes to autocomplete field results in Django admin without fully overriding the AutocompleteJsonView.get() method
- This requires duplicating a lot of code and creates maintenance overhead as AutocompleteJsonView.get() evolves

2. Cause Analysis:
- The AutocompleteJsonView.get() method directly constructs the JSON response dictionary inside the method
- There's no extension point or separate method to customize just the serialization of individual results
- This forces developers to override the entire get() method just to add extra fields to the response

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files for this issue would be:

```
django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py
django/contrib/admin/options.py
django/contrib/admin/widgets.py
```

These files are most important because:
- autocomplete.py contains the AutocompleteJsonView class that needs modification
- options.py contains ModelAdmin class which is where the autocomplete view gets registered and configured
- widgets.py contains the autocomplete widgets that consume the JSON response from AutocompleteJsonView

The issue is primarily in the AutocompleteJsonView implementation, so these files represent the core components involved in the autocomplete functionality that would need to be modified to implement the proposed solution.
