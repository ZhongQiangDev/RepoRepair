Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When viewing/editing a model with a ForeignKey field in a custom Admin Site
- The URL generated for readonly fields uses "/admin/..." instead of "/custom-admin/..."
- This is incorrect because it should use the custom admin site's URL prefix

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs in the `get_admin_url` method
- The current implementation uses `reverse()` without specifying the current admin site
- Other parts of admin use `current_app` parameter to identify the correct admin site name
- The fix proposed adds `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name` to the reverse call

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/contrib/admin/helpers.py
django/contrib/admin/sites.py
django/urls/base.py
django/contrib/admin/options.py
django/contrib/admin/models.py
```

Reasoning:
- `helpers.py` contains the `get_admin_url` method that needs modification
- `sites.py` defines the AdminSite class and URL handling for admin sites
- `base.py` contains the core reverse() function used for URL generation
- `options.py` contains ModelAdmin class that interacts with admin URLs
- `models.py` contains admin-related models that may use these URLs
