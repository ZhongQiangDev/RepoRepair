Let me help analyze this issue and identify the relevant files.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running migrations with a specified database parameter, there's an unexpected DB read request after the migration completes
- This read request ignores the specified database parameter and uses the DB router instead
- This causes issues in multi-tenant scenarios where database routing is managed through thread-local variables

2. Cause Analysis:
- After migrations complete, Django appears to be making additional database reads related to Permissions
- These reads are not respecting the database context set by the migration command
- The issue likely stems from how post-migration signals or permission setup handles database connections
- The core problem appears to be in the interaction between migration execution, permission setup, and database routing

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):
```
django/core/management/commands/migrate.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/contrib/sites/apps.py
django/db/utils.py
django/db/backends/base/base.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `migrate.py` is the primary file handling migration commands and database selection
- `executor.py` manages the actual execution of migrations and related operations
- `sites/apps.py` demonstrates how post-migration signals are handled (similar to permission setup)
- `utils.py` contains the database routing infrastructure
- `base/base.py` handles core database connection management

These files would need to be examined to ensure database context is properly maintained throughout the entire migration process, including post-migration operations.
