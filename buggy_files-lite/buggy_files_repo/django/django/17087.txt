Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The migration system is incorrectly generating the path to a class method (`default`) defined within a nested class (`Capability`) inside a model class (`Profile`). The generated path is `appname.models.Capability.default` when it should be `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default`.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how Django's migration system handles the serialization of nested class methods when they're used as default values for fields. The serializer is not correctly resolving the full path to methods defined within nested classes, leading to incorrect import paths in the generated migrations.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files for fixing this issue, ordered by importance:

```
django/db/migrations/serializer.py
django/utils/deconstruct.py
django/db/migrations/writer.py
django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
```

Reasoning for selection:
- `serializer.py` is the primary file responsible for serializing Python objects into migration-compatible strings
- `deconstruct.py` handles how objects are deconstructed for serialization
- `writer.py` generates the actual migration file content
- `makemigrations.py` orchestrates the migration creation process
- `autodetector.py` detects changes and creates migration operations

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in the serialization logic to properly handle nested class method paths.
