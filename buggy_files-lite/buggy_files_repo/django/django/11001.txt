Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The SQLCompiler is incorrectly removing one of the "order by" clauses from a query that uses multiline RawSQL expressions
- Specifically, when multiple RawSQL expressions have similar last lines, only the first clause is being kept while others are dropped

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs in SQLCompiler.get_order_by() where it uses a regex pattern (self.ordering_parts) to detect duplicate ORDER BY clauses
- When processing multiline SQL, the regex only matches the last line containing ASC/DESC keywords
- Since multiple RawSQL expressions can have identical last lines (e.g., "else null end"), the compiler wrongly identifies them as duplicates
- The core issue is that the duplicate detection is only comparing the last line rather than the entire SQL expression

```
django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
django/db/models/expressions.py
django/db/models/query.py
django/db/models/sql/query.py
django/db/models/lookups.py
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. compiler.py contains the SQLCompiler class where the bug exists in get_order_by()
2. expressions.py defines RawSQL and related expression handling
3. query.py contains the core QuerySet functionality including ordering
4. sql/query.py handles SQL query construction and optimization
5. lookups.py provides support for query operations including ordering
