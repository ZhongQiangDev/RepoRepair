Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `value in self.show_fields` where `value` is a `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` and `self.show_fields` is a dictionary, a TypeError is raised indicating that `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` is not hashable.
- This breaks custom data-* attributes being added to select widget options.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears after upgrading from Django 3.0 to 3.1
- In Django 3.1, the ModelChoiceIterator was modified to return ModelChoiceIteratorValue objects instead of raw values
- These ModelChoiceIteratorValue objects are not hashable by default, which causes issues when used as dictionary keys or in set operations
- The problem occurs specifically in form widgets dealing with model choices and custom attributes

3. Most Related Files:
```
django/forms/models.py
django/forms/widgets.py
django/db/models/fields/mixins.py
django/db/models/query.py
django/forms/fields.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `forms/models.py` contains ModelChoiceField and ModelChoiceIterator implementations which are directly related to the ModelChoiceIteratorValue issue
2. `forms/widgets.py` handles the widget rendering and option creation where the custom data-* attributes are being added
3. `models/fields/mixins.py` contains field-related functionality that affects how values are processed
4. `models/query.py` handles the queryset operations that feed into the ModelChoiceField
5. `forms/fields.py` contains base field implementations that ModelChoiceField builds upon
