Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation tries to execute after `AddIndex` operation that includes the '_order' field. The migration fails because the '_order' field hasn't been created yet when the index tries to reference it.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is an incorrect operation order in the migration file. The `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation needs to run first since it creates the '_order' field, but currently it's placed after the `AddIndex` operation that tries to use this not-yet-created field.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
django/db/models/fields/proxy.py
django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
django/db/migrations/executor.py
django/db/migrations/migration.py
```

Reasoning:
- `proxy.py` contains the `OrderWrt` class that handles the '_order' field creation
- `operations/models.py` defines `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation
- `autodetector.py` handles the detection and ordering of migration operations
- `executor.py` manages the execution order of migration operations
- `migration.py` provides the base Migration class structure

These files are most directly involved in handling the order-with-respect-to functionality and migration operation ordering that led to this issue.
