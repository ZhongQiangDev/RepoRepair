Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` is returning bytes instead of unicode/string
- This conflicts with the expectation that setting `decode_unicode=True` should return unicode, similar to `r.text`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to content decoding in the response handling
- The core problem likely lies in how the Response class handles unicode decoding when streaming content vs accessing the full text
- This would involve both the response content handling and character encoding detection

3. Most Related Files:
```
requests/models.py
requests/packages/urllib3/response.py
requests/packages/chardet/utf8prober.py
requests/packages/chardet/sbcharsetprober.py
requests/utils.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `models.py` is most important as it contains the Response class implementation with both `iter_content` and `text` properties
- `urllib3/response.py` handles the low-level response content streaming and decoding
- `chardet/utf8prober.py` and `sbcharsetprober.py` are involved in character encoding detection which is crucial for proper text decoding
- `utils.py` likely contains helper functions for content decoding and text handling
