Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- In a redirect chain, when a 303 redirect converts a POST to GET, and then a 307 redirect occurs, the request incorrectly uses POST instead of preserving the GET method from the 303 redirect.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue lies in `Session.resolve_redirects` which copies the original request object for each redirect
- When handling redirects, it's using the original request's method (POST) instead of maintaining the current request's method (GET) after the 303 redirect
- This causes the 307 redirect to incorrectly use POST when it should be using GET

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
requests/sessions.py
requests/models.py
requests/api.py
```

The `sessions.py` file is most important as it contains the `Session.resolve_redirects` method that's directly causing the issue. The `models.py` file likely contains the request object handling code that's being copied. The `api.py` file provides the high-level interface for making requests and would be involved in the redirect chain processing.
