Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code fails when trying to create a plot with a polynomial fit (`PolyFit`) when there is missing data (None value) in the input array. The error shows "LinAlgError: SVD did not converge in Linear Least Squares".

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the polynomial fitting function (`np.polyfit`) cannot handle None/NaN values directly. When the data contains missing values, the linear algebra computation for polynomial fitting fails during the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) step. The code needs to properly handle or filter out missing values before attempting the polynomial fit.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the error trace, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
seaborn/_stats/regression.py
seaborn/_core/plot.py
seaborn/regression.py
seaborn/utils.py
```

The files are ordered this way because:
- `_stats/regression.py` likely contains the PolyFit implementation that needs to handle missing values
- `_core/plot.py` contains the core plotting logic where the error surfaces
- `regression.py` contains higher-level regression plotting functions that may need to be updated
- `utils.py` may need utility functions for handling missing data
