Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using the `--notes` option in pylint, it fails to report fixme warnings (W0511) for note tags that consist entirely of punctuation characters (like "???")
- While it correctly identifies and reports tags with letters (like "YES"), it misses tags made of punctuation

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be related to how pylint processes and identifies note tags in comments
- The issue likely lies in the pattern matching or string processing logic that scans for these tags
- The core functionality for handling note tags and fixme warnings is typically in the checkers, particularly those dealing with comments and warnings

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the bug, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
pylint/checkers/misc.py
pylint/checkers/utils.py
pylint/lint/run.py
```

The `misc.py` is most important as it contains the core functionality for detecting and processing warning notes in comments. The `utils.py` likely contains helper functions for string processing and pattern matching that could be involved in the tag detection. The `run.py` handles command-line options and could be relevant for processing the `--notes` parameter.
