Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The error occurs when using '\p{Han}' in a regex pattern within pylintrc configuration
- Specifically, it fails when trying to use this pattern for function name validation
- The error message indicates "bad escape \p at position 1"

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error suggests Python's re module doesn't recognize '\p{Han}' as a valid regex escape sequence
- '\p{Han}' is a Unicode property pattern commonly used in other regex engines (like PCRE) to match Chinese characters
- Python's re module doesn't natively support Unicode property escapes (\p{...}) until Python 3.11
- The error occurs during configuration parsing when pylint tries to compile the regex pattern

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the error stack trace and functionality, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
pylint/config/config_initialization.py
pylint/config/arguments_manager.py
pylint/lint/run.py
pylint/lint/pylinter.py
pylint/checkers/misc.py
```

These files are chosen because:
- config_initialization.py and arguments_manager.py handle the parsing of configuration files and arguments where the regex validation occurs
- run.py and pylinter.py are core components that manage the initialization and execution flow
- misc.py contains checkers that might be involved in name validation patterns

The fix would likely need to be implemented in these files to either support Unicode property patterns or provide alternative pattern validation methods.
