Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running `pylint a` on a directory structure where a module contains a file with the same name as the module (e.g., `a/a.py`), pylint fails with an error trying to load a non-existent `__init__.py` file.
- However, when the file is renamed (e.g., `a/c.py`) or when `__init__.py` is created, pylint works correctly.

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a module resolution issue in pylint where it incorrectly handles the case of a module containing a file with the same name.
- When pylint encounters `a/a.py`, it seems to mistakenly treat `a` as a package rather than a module, hence looking for `__init__.py`.
- This is likely related to Python's import system and how pylint resolves module paths during its analysis.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in module resolution and path handling:

```
pylint/lint/pylinter.py
pylint/checkers/imports.py
pylint/epylint.py
pylint/typing.py
pylint/interfaces.py
```

The `pylinter.py` is most important as it's the core linting engine that handles module resolution. `imports.py` handles import checking and module path resolution. `epylint.py` deals with file/module handling. `typing.py` contains relevant type definitions for module handling, and `interfaces.py` provides base functionality for checkers that might affect module resolution.
