Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code in `fitsrec.py` attempts to replace 'E' with 'D' in floating point number formats using the `replace()` method on a `chararray`, but this operation is not working as intended because the replacement is not being stored.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is that `replace()` method for `chararray` returns a new array with the replacements rather than modifying the original array in-place. The current code ignores the returned value, so the replacement has no effect. This is similar to how Python strings' `replace()` method works - it returns a new string rather than modifying the original.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the bug, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py
astropy/io/fits/column.py
astropy/io/fits/file.py
```

`fitsrec.py` is the primary file containing the bug and needs to be fixed. `column.py` is important as it handles column formats and data type conversions in FITS files. `file.py` provides the base file handling functionality that may interact with the format conversions.

These files form the core of the FITS file handling system where the format conversion takes place. The bug specifically relates to handling scientific notation format conversions in FITS records.
