Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The WCS transformation function `wcs.wcs_pix2world([], [], 0)` fails with an `InconsistentAxisTypesError` when given empty lists as input, instead of returning empty lists as expected.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in the WCS transformation pipeline where empty arrays are not properly handled. The error message indicates that `ncoord` and/or `nelem` are inconsistent with the `wcsprm` structure, suggesting that the code doesn't properly validate or handle zero-length input arrays before passing them to the underlying C implementation (wcslib).

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the error traceback and repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
astropy/wcs/wcs.py
astropy/wcs/utils.py
astropy/io/fits/util.py
```

The `wcs.py` file is most critical as it contains the WCS class and transformation methods where the error occurs. The `utils.py` files may contain supporting functions that handle array operations and validations. The error originates in the WCS transformation code, specifically in the array handling and validation before passing to the C-level functions.
