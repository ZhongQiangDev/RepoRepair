Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `separability_matrix` function is not correctly computing separability for nested CompoundModels. Specifically, when a compound model (cm = Linear1D & Linear1D) is nested within another compound model (Pix2Sky_TAN & cm), the separability matrix incorrectly shows the inputs and outputs as not being separable when they should be.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the separability calculation handles nested compound models. When models are nested, the separability computation seems to lose track of the individual model components' separability properties. The Linear1D models should maintain their separability even when nested, but the current implementation treats them as non-separable when they're part of a nested structure.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
astropy/modeling/separable.py
astropy/modeling/core.py
astropy/modeling/mappings.py
```

The `separable.py` file is most important as it contains the actual `separability_matrix` implementation. The `core.py` file is second as it defines the model classes and compound model behavior. The `mappings.py` file is third as it handles input/output mappings which could affect how separability is determined in compound models.

These files would need to be modified to fix the incorrect handling of separability in nested compound models.
