Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that the RestructuredText (RST) writer doesn't support the `header_rows` parameter, which is available in other writers like `ascii.fixed_width`. This causes a TypeError when trying to write a table with header rows in RST format.

2. Cause Analysis:
The RST writer class in `astropy/io/ascii/rst.py` doesn't implement support for `header_rows` parameter, which would allow writing additional header rows like units below column names. The error occurs because the parameter is passed through but not handled by the RST writer implementation.

3. Most Related Files:
```
astropy/io/ascii/rst.py
astropy/io/ascii/basic.py
astropy/io/ascii/core.py
astropy/io/ascii/ui.py
astropy/io/ascii/fixed_width.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- `rst.py` contains the RST writer implementation that needs to be modified
- `basic.py` contains base classes that RST writer inherits from
- `core.py` provides core functionality for ASCII writers
- `ui.py` handles the user interface for reading/writing tables
- `fixed_width.py` contains the working implementation of `header_rows` that could be referenced
