I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that the `ascii.qdp` format in Astropy assumes QDP commands must be in uppercase (e.g., "READ SERR 1 2"), but QDP itself is not case-sensitive and can accept lowercase commands (e.g., "read serr 1 2"). This causes Astropy to fail when parsing QDP files with lowercase commands.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is likely in the QDP file format parser implementation in Astropy. The parser is rejecting lowercase QDP commands as unrecognized, raising a `ValueError` with the message "Unrecognized QDP line: read serr 1 2". The fix would involve modifying the parser to handle commands case-insensitively, converting all commands to uppercase before processing them.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py
astropy/io/ascii/core.py
```

The primary file that needs to be edited is `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py`, which would contain the implementation of the QDP file format parser. This is where the case-sensitivity check would be happening.

The secondary file is `astropy/io/ascii/core.py`, which contains the base classes for ASCII parsers that the QDP parser would inherit from. This file might need modifications if the issue is related to how commands are processed at a more general level.

While other files in the repository might interact with the QDP parser, these two files are most directly related to the issue of case-sensitivity in QDP command parsing.
