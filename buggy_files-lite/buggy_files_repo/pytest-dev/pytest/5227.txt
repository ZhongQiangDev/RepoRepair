Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The current default logging format only shows the base filename and line number, which makes it harder to identify the exact module/location when debugging, especially in larger projects. The current format lacks the full module path context.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the logging format configuration that uses `%(filename)s` instead of `%(name)s` in the default format string. The `filename` parameter only shows the base filename, while `name` would show the full Python module path, providing better context for debugging.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, I can only see two Python files, and neither appears to be directly related to the logging configuration. The files shown (`scripts/release.py` and `testing/python/collect.py`) don't contain the logging format definition.

Without access to the full repository, I cannot definitively identify the exact files that need modification. However, typically in a Python project, logging configuration would be in:

```
config.py
settings.py
logging.py
```

Note: To properly fix this issue, we would need access to the file that contains the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` definition, which is not shown in the provided repository information.
