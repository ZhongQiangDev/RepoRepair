Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The pytest assertion rewriter is failing when trying to check for "PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE" in what it thinks is a docstring, but is actually receiving an integer value. This causes a TypeError because you can't check if a string exists within an integer.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs in pytest's assertion rewriting mechanism. When the first expression in a Python file is a number, pytest's assertion rewriter mistakenly treats this number as a docstring. When it then tries to check if "PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE" exists in this "docstring" (which is actually an integer), it fails because integers are not iterable like strings.

3. Most Related Files:
```
_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py
testing/python/collect.py
doc/en/example/nonpython/conftest.py
```

The `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` would be the most important file to fix since that's where the assertion rewriting logic lives and where the error is occurring (though it's not in the provided repository files). Among the available files, `testing/python/collect.py` is most relevant as it handles test collection and could include tests for this scenario. The `conftest.py` is less relevant but shows how pytest handles different types of test files.

Note: The actual fix would need to be made in pytest's core codebase, specifically in the assertion rewriter module, which isn't shown in the provided repository files.
