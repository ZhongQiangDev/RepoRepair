Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- In Python 3.9, when an assertion fails, the error message includes extra code (the decorator `@t`) that appears after the failing assertion line
- This doesn't happen in Python 3.7, which shows the correct behavior by only displaying the relevant assertion line

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a traceback/source code display issue in pytest when handling assertions
- The problem seems related to how pytest determines which lines of code to show in the error message
- The issue specifically involves decorator handling in the traceback/assertion error formatting
- Since this only happens in Python 3.9, it's likely related to changes in how Python 3.9 handles code object line numbers or how pytest interacts with Python's traceback system

3. Most Related Files:
```
testing/python/raises.py
testing/python/collect.py
testing/python/fixtures.py
```

I selected these files because:
- `raises.py` is most relevant as it handles assertion and exception reporting
- `collect.py` contains TestTracebackCutting class which deals with traceback handling
- `fixtures.py` contains test infrastructure that might affect how decorators and assertions interact

The other files seem less directly related to assertion error display and traceback handling.
