Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running `pytest --fixtures`, the scope of fixtures is not displayed in the output
- Users can only learn about fixture scopes by checking documentation or source code

2. Cause Analysis:
- Based on the repository information, the fixture display functionality is handled in `TestShowFixtures` class within `testing/python/fixtures.py`
- The current implementation likely doesn't include scope information when formatting fixture information for display
- The scope information exists in the fixture definitions but isn't being included in the output formatting

3. Most Related Files:
```
testing/python/fixtures.py
testing/python/metafunc.py
```

I'm listing these files because:
- `fixtures.py` contains `TestShowFixtures` which directly handles fixture display functionality and would need to be modified to include scope information
- `metafunc.py` contains fixture-related classes and utilities that might need adjustments to support exposing scope information

The other files (`collect.py` and `integration.py`) are less relevant as they focus on test collection and integration testing rather than fixture display functionality.
