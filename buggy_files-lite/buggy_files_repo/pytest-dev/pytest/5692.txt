Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The pytest-generated JUnit XML reports are missing two attributes in the `testsuite` element:
- `hostname` attribute
- `timestamp` attribute

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in pytest's XML report generation functionality. The XML report generator is not including these system-specific attributes that are typically present in standard JUnit XML reports. This would likely be handled in pytest's core XML reporting module.

3. Most Related Files:
Looking through the provided repository information, none of the files shown are directly related to XML report generation. The files provided are mostly about test collection, integration testing, and YAML handling. However, from the files shown, here are the most relevant ones that could potentially interact with test reporting:

```
testing/python/collect.py
testing/python/integration.py
```

Note: The actual fix would likely need to be made in pytest's XML reporting module files, which are not shown in the provided repository information. The core XML reporting functionality would typically be in files related to JUnit XML generation or test reporting.
