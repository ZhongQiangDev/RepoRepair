Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When using `str()` on a pytest.raises context variable (e), it only shows a truncated version of the error message ("A") instead of the full multi-line error message ("A\nB\nC") that would be shown in a regular try-except block.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how pytest implements string representation of its ExceptionInfo object (which is what 'e' refers to in the pytest.raises context). When str() is called on this object, it's providing a different string representation than what you get when calling str() on the actual exception object. The full exception message is still accessible via e.value, but the direct string representation is different.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant files would be:

```
testing/python/raises.py
```

The `testing/python/raises.py` file is the most (and only) relevant file from the provided repository information, as it contains the `TestRaises` class which handles the pytest.raises functionality testing. This would be where the string representation behavior of exception info objects would be defined and tested.

Note: The complete fix might require access to additional files that weren't included in the repository information provided, particularly the core pytest files that implement the ExceptionInfo class and its string representation methods.
