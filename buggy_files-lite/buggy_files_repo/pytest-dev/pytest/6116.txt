Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is not about wrong behavior, but rather a feature request. Users want a shorter command-line option (single character) as an alternative to the lengthy `--collect-only` argument in pytest.

2. Cause Analysis:
The `--collect-only` option is currently only available as a long-form command line argument. There is no short-form alternative (like `-c` or similar) defined in pytest's argument parsing system. This makes the command more verbose than necessary for frequent use.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to implement this feature, ordered by importance:

```
testing/python/collect.py
doc/en/example/pythoncollection.py
doc/en/example/py2py3/conftest.py
```

The `testing/python/collect.py` file is most important as it contains the core collection functionality tests and would need to be updated to test the new short-form option. The documentation examples would need to be updated to reflect the new short-form option. Note that the actual implementation file that defines the command-line options isn't shown in the provided repository information, but would also need to be modified.
