Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The test is failing because `logging.Logger.store` attribute is not found
- There are two different instances of `pmxbot.logging` module present in the system
- The initialization effect from `core.initialize()` doesn't persist

2. Cause Analysis:
- The root cause appears to be related to Python's import system and namespace packages
- The switch from pkg_resources style namespace packaging to PEP 420 namespace packages is causing module import duplication
- The `importlib` import mode is causing the module to be imported twice in different contexts, leading to two separate instances of the same module
- Changes in the import system are preventing the initialized state from being shared between the two module instances

3. Most relevant files based on the repository information:

```
testing/python/collect.py
testing/python/integration.py
testing/python/fixtures.py
```

I selected these files because:
- `collect.py` is most relevant as it deals with module collection and import behaviors
- `integration.py` handles test integration scenarios and module attributes
- `fixtures.py` manages test setup and initialization which is related to the core.initialize() issue

Note: While the repository information provided contains several test files, they don't seem to include the actual source files where the fix would need to be implemented (`pmxbot/logging.py`, `pmxbot/core.py`, etc.). The files listed above would be helpful for understanding and testing the fix, but the actual fix would likely need to be made in the main source files that weren't included in the repository information.
