Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue occurs when pytest encounters an exception in both `__getattribute__` and `__repr__` methods of a class. Instead of properly handling and reporting the exception, pytest encounters an "INTERNALERROR" with "RuntimeError: No active exception to reraise".

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in pytest's exception handling and reporting mechanism. When trying to generate a safe representation of the test object for error reporting, pytest's saferepr functionality encounters a bare `raise` statement in `__repr__`, which attempts to re-raise an exception when there isn't one active in the current context. This creates a problematic situation where pytest's internal error reporting mechanism itself fails.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the traceback and repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
testing/python/raises.py
testing/python/collect.py
testing/python/fixtures.py
```

The `raises.py` file is most important as it handles pytest's exception handling and reporting mechanisms. The `collect.py` file is relevant as it deals with test collection and representation. The `fixtures.py` file may be involved as it handles test setup and execution context.

These files would need to be modified to properly handle cases where object representation methods raise exceptions, particularly ensuring proper exception context is maintained throughout the reporting chain.
