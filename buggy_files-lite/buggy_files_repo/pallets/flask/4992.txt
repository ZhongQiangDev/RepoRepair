Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When trying to use `app.config.from_file()` with Python 3.11's `tomllib.load` to read TOML files, it fails with a TypeError because the file is opened in text mode instead of binary mode.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The `from_file()` method in Flask's Config class opens files in text mode by default
- `tomllib.load()` specifically requires files to be opened in binary mode
- There's no parameter in `from_file()` to specify the file mode

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/flask/config.py
```

I'm only listing one file because:
- The issue is specifically about the `Config` class's `from_file()` method
- The file `src/flask/config.py` contains this class and method
- The other files in the repository information (blueprints.py, cli.py, ctx.py, debughelpers.py, helpers.py, logging.py, templating.py) are not directly related to configuration file loading functionality

The fix would need to modify the `from_file()` method in `config.py` to add a mode parameter and use it when opening the configuration file.
