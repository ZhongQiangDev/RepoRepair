Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Blueprint names containing dots (periods) are currently allowed but shouldn't be since dots are now significant for nested blueprints
- This is inconsistent with endpoint names which already have this validation in place

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Blueprint class initialization doesn't validate the blueprint name for dots
- Since blueprints can now be nested, dots in names could cause ambiguity or conflicts in the blueprint hierarchy
- Similar validation exists for endpoint names but was missed for blueprint names
- This validation would likely need to be added in the Blueprint class initialization

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/flask/blueprints.py
src/flask/scaffold.py
```

The `blueprints.py` file is most important as it contains the Blueprint class definition and initialization. The `scaffold.py` file is secondary since Blueprint inherits from Scaffold and some related functionality might be there. Other files in the repository are less relevant to this specific blueprint naming issue.
