Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem occurs when trying to use `to_unstacked_dataset` on a stacked array that was created from single-dimension variables. The operation fails with a MergeError about conflicting values for variable 'y'.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the merging logic when unstacking variables. When dealing with single-dimension variables, there's a conflict in handling the 'y' coordinate during the merge operation that happens as part of unstacking. This suggests an issue in either the stacking/unstacking implementation or the underlying merge functionality that handles coordinate reconciliation.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the problem, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
xarray/core/merge.py
xarray/core/dataset.py
xarray/core/dataarray.py
xarray/core/coordinates.py
xarray/core/variable.py
```

Reasoning:
- `merge.py` is most important as the error is a MergeError and the issue occurs during merging operations
- `dataset.py` is critical as it handles Dataset operations including stacking/unstacking
- `dataarray.py` is relevant as it deals with the DataArray transformations
- `coordinates.py` is important as the issue involves coordinate handling
- `variable.py` is included as it handles the underlying variable operations
