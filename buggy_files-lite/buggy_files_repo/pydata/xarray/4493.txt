Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `DataSet.update()` with a chunked dask DataArray, the DataArray loses its chunked state and becomes eagerly evaluated
- This happens even though the input DataArray was still chunked before the update operation

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how `Dataset.update()` handles dask arrays during the update operation
- The problem likely stems from the update operation not preserving the chunked state of dask arrays
- This suggests there's a missing check or handling in the update logic to maintain the lazy evaluation properties of dask arrays

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
xarray/core/computation.py
xarray/core/merge.py
xarray/core/variable.py
xarray/core/alignment.py
xarray/core/indexing.py
```

Reasoning:
- `computation.py` handles core computation behavior including dask array operations
- `merge.py` contains the update/merge logic that's directly related to the issue
- `variable.py` manages the core Variable class which handles data arrays
- `alignment.py` deals with aligning data during operations like update
- `indexing.py` handles array indexing which is involved in update operations

These files would need to be examined to ensure proper handling of chunked dask arrays during update operations.
