Let me help analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Dataset overview representation doesn't show units for coordinates and data variables, making it less informative for users who need to understand the physical quantities represented by each variable.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue relates to how xarray formats and displays Dataset information in its string representation. The units information is likely stored in the metadata/attributes of the variables but is not being included in the Dataset's repr formatting. This would involve the formatting logic for Dataset objects and their string representation.

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
xarray/core/formatting.py
xarray/core/dataset.py
xarray/core/variable.py
xarray/core/dataarray.py
xarray/core/common.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `formatting.py` would be the primary file responsible for how Dataset objects are formatted for display
- `dataset.py` contains the core Dataset class implementation and its string representation methods
- `variable.py` handles the underlying variable objects that store the actual data and metadata
- `dataarray.py` contains DataArray implementation which is closely related to Dataset representation
- `common.py` contains shared functionality that might affect how attributes and metadata are handled
