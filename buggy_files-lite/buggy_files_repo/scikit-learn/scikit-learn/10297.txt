Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- RidgeClassifierCV raises TypeError when using the `store_cv_values` parameter
- The documentation claims this parameter exists but trying to use it results in an error
- The error specifically states that `store_cv_values` is an unexpected keyword argument

2. Cause Analysis:
- The documentation mentions `cv_values_` attribute that depends on `store_cv_values` parameter
- However, the actual RidgeClassifierCV implementation doesn't include this parameter in its __init__ method
- This appears to be a mismatch between documentation and implementation, where the parameter exists in RidgeCV but was not implemented in RidgeClassifierCV

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/exceptions.py
```

Note: While `ridge.py` isn't in the provided repository information, it would be the primary file containing the RidgeClassifierCV implementation and would need to be modified. The validation.py file would be involved in parameter validation, and exceptions.py would handle the error types. Other files in the repository information seem less relevant to this specific issue.
