Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `transform_output="pandas"` with FeatureUnion and a custom transformer that performs groupby aggregation, a ValueError is raised due to length mismatch between the input data (96 elements) and the transformed data (4 elements).
- The same code works fine with `transform_output="default"` (numpy output).

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs because FeatureUnion tries to maintain the original input's index when wrapping the transformed data in a pandas DataFrame
- The custom transformer performs a groupby operation that reduces the number of rows from 96 (hourly data) to 4 (daily aggregates)
- When sklearn tries to set the original index (96 rows) to the transformed data (4 rows), it raises a ValueError due to length mismatch
- This is a fundamental incompatibility between FeatureUnion's assumption that transformers preserve sample count and aggregation operations that reduce sample count

3. Most relevant files:
```
sklearn/pipeline.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/utils/_set_output.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
1. `pipeline.py` contains the FeatureUnion implementation which is central to the issue
2. `utils/validation.py` handles data validation and indexing checks
3. `base.py` defines the transformer interface and base classes
4. `utils/_set_output.py` manages the pandas output transformation that triggers the error

Note: While `_set_output.py` wasn't in the repository information, it's clearly involved based on the error traceback. I included it as it's directly related to the issue.
