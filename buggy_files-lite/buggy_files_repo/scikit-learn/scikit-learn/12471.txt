Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When OneHotEncoder is set to handle unknown entries with 'ignore' option and the input contains string categories
- The encoder tries to replace unknown strings with the first category (alphabetically sorted) from training data
- This causes a ValueError when the first category string is longer than the unknown string being transformed

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue appears to be unsafe memory handling when dealing with string arrays
- When transforming unknown categories, the encoder attempts to write the first known category into the array positions of unknown values
- This direct memory modification fails when the target string is longer than the space allocated for the unknown string
- This suggests the issue lies in the preprocessing/encoding logic, particularly around string handling and memory management

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
sklearn/preprocessing/label.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/exceptions.py
sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `preprocessing/label.py` is most critical as it contains the core encoding logic for categorical variables
- `utils/validation.py` handles input validation and data type checking which is relevant to the string handling issue
- `base.py` contains base estimator functionality that OneHotEncoder inherits from
- `exceptions.py` handles error cases which could be modified to better handle this scenario
- `utils/multiclass.py` provides utilities for handling multiple classes/labels which is related to the encoding process
