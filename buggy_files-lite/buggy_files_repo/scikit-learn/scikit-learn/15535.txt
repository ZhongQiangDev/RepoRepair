Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `mutual_info_score` with string labels of type `object`, it fails with a ValueError trying to convert strings to floats
- The same code works (with warning) when strings are not explicitly cast to `object` type
- This is a regression as it worked without warning in version 0.21.1

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the input validation of clustering metrics
- The error suggests the function is trying to convert string labels to floats unnecessarily
- The problem specifically occurs with the `mutual_info_score` function when handling categorical/string data
- The type casting to `object` is triggering stricter type checking that's causing the error

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files:

```
sklearn/metrics/cluster.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/exceptions.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `metrics/cluster.py` would contain the `mutual_info_score` implementation
2. `utils/validation.py` handles input validation which is where the type conversion error is occurring
3. `utils/multiclass.py` handles label processing and type checking
4. `base.py` contains core functionality that might affect type handling
5. `exceptions.py` defines the error types being raised

Note: While `metrics/cluster.py` wasn't provided in the repository information, it would be the primary file needing modification based on the error description.
