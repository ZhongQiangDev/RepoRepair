Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The NearestNeighbors estimator accepts a float value for n_neighbors parameter (3.0)
- This leads to a TypeError when trying to use it as an integer in the underlying implementation
- The error occurs both when setting n_neighbors in initialization and in the kneighbors method

2. Cause Analysis:
- The parameter validation for n_neighbors is insufficient
- It should check and enforce that n_neighbors is an integer before passing it to the underlying implementation
- The error originates from the binary_tree.pxi file where the NeighborsHeap tries to use the float value as an integer

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files:

```
sklearn/neighbors/base.py
sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py
sklearn/base.py
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
- sklearn/neighbors/base.py contains the core NeighborsBase class which should handle parameter validation
- sklearn/neighbors/unsupervised.py contains the NearestNeighbors class implementation
- sklearn/base.py contains BaseEstimator which provides parameter validation infrastructure

These files would need to be modified to add proper type checking and validation for the n_neighbors parameter.
