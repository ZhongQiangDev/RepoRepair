Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The code tries to print a LogisticRegressionCV object with `print_changed_only=True`, but raises a ValueError about array truth value being ambiguous. This suggests the printing functionality is not properly handling numpy arrays in the object's parameters.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error occurs because the code is trying to compare a numpy array (`Cs=[0.1, 1]`) directly in a boolean context, which numpy doesn't allow without explicitly specifying how to reduce the array (using .any() or .all()). This likely happens during the object's string representation when trying to determine which parameters differ from defaults.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in the printing functionality and parameter handling:

```
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sklearn/base.py` is most important as it contains the `BaseEstimator` class which handles parameter management and readable representation of estimators, including the `print_changed_only` functionality
- `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is relevant as it handles parameter validation and processing
- `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py` would contain the LogisticRegressionCV implementation, though it wasn't in the provided files, it would be the actual class being instantiated

The issue likely needs to be fixed in the parameter comparison logic within BaseEstimator's string representation code, specifically to handle numpy array parameters correctly when print_changed_only is enabled.
