Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The KernelPCA with RBF kernel is producing results that are identical in magnitude but different in signs when run multiple times on the same dataset. This indicates an inconsistency in the sign of eigenvectors being computed.

2. Cause Analysis:
This is actually expected behavior in PCA/KernelPCA. The sign ambiguity occurs because eigenvectors can point in either direction while still being valid eigenvectors - multiplying an eigenvector by -1 still gives a valid eigenvector. This is a mathematical property rather than a bug. The signs of eigenvectors are arbitrary and don't affect the quality of the dimensionality reduction.

3. Most relevant files:
```
sklearn/decomposition/pca.py
sklearn/utils/extmath.py
sklearn/decomposition/base.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- pca.py contains the core PCA implementation including kernel variants
- extmath.py contains linear algebra utilities used in eigenvalue decomposition
- base.py contains the base PCA class with common functionality

The other files in the repository information are less relevant as they deal with different algorithms (NMF, MDS) or exception handling.
