Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using CalibratedClassifierCV with isotonic regression after setting `set_config(transform_output="pandas")`, the code crashes with a ValueError about broadcasting arrays.
- The error occurs in the predict_proba method when trying to assign calibrated probabilities.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The IsotonicRegression calibrator is returning a pandas DataFrame due to the global config setting `transform_output="pandas"`
- In _CalibratedClassifier's predict_proba method, it tries to assign this DataFrame to a numpy array slice using `proba[:, class_idx] = calibrator.predict(this_pred)`
- The shape mismatch occurs because the DataFrame has shape (20,1) while the target numpy array expects shape (20,)

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
sklearn/calibration.py
sklearn/isotonic.py
sklearn/base.py
```

The calibration.py file contains the core CalibratedClassifierCV implementation where the error occurs. The isotonic.py file contains the IsotonicRegression class that needs to handle the pandas output correctly. The base.py file contains core functionality that affects transform output behavior.

These files would need to be modified to ensure proper handling of pandas DataFrame outputs when using calibration with isotonic regression.
