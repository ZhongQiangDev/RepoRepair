Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `warm_start` parameter exists in `IsolationForest` through inheritance from `BaseBagging` but is not exposed in the `__init__()` method
- Users can't easily discover or use this functionality without diving into source code
- Documentation doesn't mention this capability

2. Cause Analysis:
- `IsolationForest` inherits from `BaseBagging` which has the `warm_start` parameter
- The parameter is functional but not exposed in the initialization interface
- This is primarily an interface/documentation issue rather than a functional bug

3. Most relevant files (ordered by importance):

```
sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py
sklearn/ensemble/base.py
sklearn/ensemble/bagging.py
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/tree/tree.py
```

Reasoning:
- `iforest.py` contains the `IsolationForest` class that needs modification
- `base.py` and `bagging.py` contain the parent classes with the `warm_start` functionality
- `base.py` (sklearn root) contains core estimator functionality
- `tree.py` contains the base tree implementation used by IsolationForest
