Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem is that trying to get the length of a Pipeline object using `len(pipe)` raises an error. This prevents using Pipeline objects with operations that rely on length, such as `pipe[:len(pipe)]`.

2. Cause Analysis:
The Pipeline class doesn't implement the `__len__` method, which is needed for Python objects to support the `len()` function. This method should return the number of steps in the pipeline. Since Pipeline is a sequence of transformers followed by an estimator, its length should be the number of these components.

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files from the repository information, ordered by importance:

```
sklearn/pipeline.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/multiclass.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sklearn/pipeline.py` is the most important as it contains the Pipeline class implementation where the `__len__` method needs to be added
- `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is relevant as it contains validation utilities that might be used in implementing length-related functionality
- `sklearn/multiclass.py` is somewhat relevant as it contains examples of handling sequential operations with estimators, which could inform the Pipeline implementation
