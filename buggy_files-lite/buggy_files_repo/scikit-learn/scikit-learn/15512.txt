Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- According to documentation, when AffinityPropagation clustering doesn't converge, it should return:
  - Empty array for cluster_center_indices_
  - -1 for all labels
- However, it's returning actual cluster assignments ([2] and [0,0,0]) even when not converged

2. Cause Analysis:
- The algorithm is not properly handling the non-convergence case
- There's no proper convergence check or flag being set
- The documentation states one behavior but the implementation does another
- The issue seems to be in the core clustering logic and how it handles convergence status

3. Most Related Files:
```
sklearn/cluster/setup.py
sklearn/exceptions.py
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `sklearn/cluster/setup.py` is most important as it contains the core clustering module configuration
- `sklearn/exceptions.py` contains ConvergenceWarning and related error handling
- `sklearn/base.py` contains base estimator classes that clustering algorithms inherit from
- `sklearn/utils/validation.py` handles input validation and processing
- `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py` deals with label handling which is relevant to the cluster label assignment

The fix would likely need to start with the clustering module configuration and then ensure proper convergence handling through the exception and validation layers.
