Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `warn_on_dtype` parameter in `check_array` is not triggering a warning when the input is a pandas DataFrame with object dtype that gets converted to float64.
- The warning should show "Data with input dtype object was converted to float64" but no warning appears.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the data validation and type conversion logic when handling pandas DataFrames
- The `check_array` function from sklearn.utils.validation is not properly handling the `warn_on_dtype` flag for DataFrame inputs
- This likely involves the interaction between data type checking, conversion warnings, and DataFrame handling

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/exceptions.py
sklearn/utils/fixes.py
sklearn/preprocessing/data.py
sklearn/utils/testing.py
```

Reasoning:
- `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is most important as it contains the `check_array` function where the issue occurs
- `sklearn/exceptions.py` contains the warning classes including `DataConversionWarning`
- `sklearn/utils/fixes.py` may contain compatibility fixes for data type handling
- `sklearn/preprocessing/data.py` handles data type conversions and transformations
- `sklearn/utils/testing.py` contains testing utilities that could help verify warning behavior
