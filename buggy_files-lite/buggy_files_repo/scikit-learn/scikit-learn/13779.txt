Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The VotingClassifier fails when trying to fit with sample weights after setting one of its estimators to None. The error occurs because it tries to call .fit() on a None object.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the VotingClassifier not properly checking if an estimator is None before attempting to use sample weights during fitting. When an estimator is set to None and sample weights are provided, it still tries to call the fit method on that None estimator, leading to an AttributeError.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
sklearn/ensemble/voting.py
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/exceptions.py
```

The `voting.py` file would be the primary location for the VotingClassifier implementation. The `base.py` contains core estimator functionality. `metaestimators.py` handles meta-estimator behaviors which is relevant since VotingClassifier is a meta-estimator. `validation.py` would contain input validation utilities, and `exceptions.py` would be relevant for proper error handling.

Note: Since `voting.py` was empty in the provided repository information, we can't see the actual implementation, but it would be the main file needing modification to fix this issue.
