Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is in the `_estimate_mi` function where there's a direct string comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'`, but `discrete_features` can actually be an array of indices or a boolean mask. This comparison will cause errors in future NumPy versions.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The code is incorrectly comparing a potential array/mask with a string literal 'auto'
- This type of comparison between arrays and strings will be deprecated in future NumPy versions
- The code path for non-'auto' discrete features appears untested
- The comparison should likely use a different approach to check if discrete_features is 'auto' vs an array/mask

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information provided and the nature of the issue (array comparison and validation), these would be the most relevant files:

```
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
sklearn/preprocessing/imputation.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `validation.py` contains core validation utilities that handle input checking and type validation
- `multiclass.py` has utilities for handling arrays and masks in classification contexts
- `imputation.py` deals with array processing and feature handling, which is related to the discrete features functionality

I limited to 3 files since the others in the repository information don't appear to be as directly related to array validation and feature handling.
