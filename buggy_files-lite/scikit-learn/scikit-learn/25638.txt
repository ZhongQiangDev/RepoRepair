Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `unique_labels` function raises a ValueError when handling nullable pandas dtypes ("Int64", "Float64", "boolean")
- The error message indicates a mix of types {'binary', 'unknown'} is not allowed
- This behavior differs from how regular numpy dtypes (int64, float64, bool) are handled, which work without error

2. Cause Analysis:
- When pandas nullable dtypes are converted to numpy arrays, they become 'object' dtype
- The `unique_labels` function is not properly handling these object dtypes and misclassifies them
- The type checking logic in `unique_labels` needs to be updated to properly handle pandas nullable types by recognizing them as equivalent to their non-nullable counterparts

3. Most Related Files:
```
sklearn/utils/multiclass.py
sklearn/utils/validation.py
sklearn/base.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py` contains the `unique_labels` function that needs modification
- `sklearn/utils/validation.py` handles input validation and type checking
- `sklearn/base.py` contains core functionality that might need updates for pandas dtype support

The other files in the repository information are less relevant as they deal with estimators, exceptions, and fixes unrelated to label type checking.
