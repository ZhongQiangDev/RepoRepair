Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Mixture models have inconsistent API compared to other clustering algorithms
- They use `n_components` instead of `n_clusters`
- They don't store `labels_` of training data
- They lack `fit_predict` method
- Documentation is separate from other clustering algorithms

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue is that mixture models were implemented without following the clustering interface conventions, despite being conceptually similar to clustering algorithms. This stems from:
- Not inheriting from or implementing ClusterMixin
- Using different parameter naming conventions
- Missing standard clustering attributes/methods
- Being treated as a separate category in documentation

3. Most Related Files:
```
sklearn/mixture/base.py
sklearn/base.py
sklearn/cluster/hierarchical.py
sklearn/mixture/gmm.py
sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `sklearn/mixture/base.py` contains the base mixture model implementation that needs to be modified to align with clustering interfaces
- `sklearn/base.py` contains the ClusterMixin that defines the standard clustering interface
- `sklearn/cluster/hierarchical.py` provides a good reference implementation of a proper clustering interface
- `sklearn/mixture/gmm.py` and `sklearn/mixture/dpgmm.py` are specific mixture model implementations that would need updates to reflect base class changes
