Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Unable to pickle (serialize) a matplotlib figure that contains a draggable legend
- Error: `TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs when trying to pickle a figure containing a draggable legend
- The draggable functionality adds a `DraggableLegend` instance which contains references to Qt canvas objects
- Qt canvas objects are not picklable because they contain C++ backend objects and GUI state
- The core issue lies in the interaction between the legend dragging functionality and the pickling mechanism

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
lib/matplotlib/legend.py
lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

The `legend.py` file is most important as it contains the `DraggableLegend` class implementation. The `offsetbox.py` file contains the base draggable functionality through `DraggableBase` and `DraggableOffsetBox` classes. The `pyplot.py` file provides the high-level interface for legend creation and figure handling.
