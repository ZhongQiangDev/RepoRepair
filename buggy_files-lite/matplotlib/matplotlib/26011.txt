Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The "xlim_changed" callbacks are not being triggered when axis limits change through a shared axis (sharex=)
- This means event handlers listening for x-axis limit changes don't get notified when the change comes from a shared axis

2. Cause Analysis:
- In the set_xlim method, when propagating changes to shared axes, emit=False is passed
- This prevents the xlim_changed callbacks from being triggered on the shared axes
- The emit=False parameter appears to be used to prevent recursion, but it also blocks legitimate callback notifications
- The issue suggests moving the callback trigger outside the emit check could resolve this

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):
```
lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py
lib/matplotlib/axis.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

The _base.py file is clearly the most important since it contains the problematic set_xlim code. The axis.py file is second as it handles axis-related functionality and callbacks. pyplot.py is included as it provides the high-level interface for axis manipulation but is less directly involved with the core issue.

I excluded scale.py as it deals with axis scaling transformations rather than limit changes and callbacks.
