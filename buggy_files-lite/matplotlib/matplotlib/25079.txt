Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When setting a LogNorm after creating a colorbar, the code fails with "ValueError: Invalid vmin or vmax"
- This happens despite explicitly setting valid vmin/vmax values and having no negative/zero values in the data
- The code worked in previous matplotlib versions but fails in 3.6.3

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs during the colorbar update process after changing the norm
- When setting a new norm, the ScalarMappable needs to update its normalization and notify connected objects (like colorbar)
- The validation of vmin/vmax appears to be failing during this update process
- This suggests an issue in how the normalization update is propagated between the plot, colorbar, and norm objects

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/colors.py
lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py
lib/matplotlib/cm.py
```

These files are most relevant because:
- colors.py contains the LogNorm and normalization classes that handle vmin/vmax validation
- colorbar.py manages the colorbar updates and interactions with the plot's normalization
- cm.py contains ScalarMappable which handles the connection between data, normalization, and colormapping

I limited to 3 files since the other files (dates.py, pyplot.py, style/core.py) are not directly related to the normalization and colorbar interaction issue.
