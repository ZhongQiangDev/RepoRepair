Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The RangeSlider widget fails to initialize with custom initial values (valinit=[0.0,0.0])
- It throws an IndexError indicating that index 4 is out of bounds for an array of size 4

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in the `set_val` method of RangeSlider in widgets.py
- The polygon (self.poly.xy) used to draw the slider has only 4 vertices, but the code tries to access index 4
- The problematic lines are trying to set xy[4] = val[0], .25 for vertical orientation and xy[4] = val[0], .25 for horizontal orientation
- These lines appear to be redundant since they're setting the same coordinates as xy[0], creating a closed polygon

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/widgets.py
```

Only one file needs to be modified since this is a straightforward bug in the RangeSlider widget implementation within widgets.py. The other files in the repository information (pyplot.py and scale.py) are not directly related to this slider widget issue.

The fix would involve removing or commenting out the redundant xy[4] assignments in the set_val method of the RangeSlider class in widgets.py, as suggested in the bug report.
