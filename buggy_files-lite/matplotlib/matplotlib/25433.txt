Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` in the `on_changed` callback of a RangeSlider widget, all widgets in the figure become unresponsive to mouse input
- The same operations work fine when done in a Button's `on_clicked` callback

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to event handling and widget state management during figure clearing and redrawing
- The RangeSlider widget's event handling system seems to get corrupted or disconnected when the figure is cleared and redrawn within its own callback
- This suggests a potential issue in how widget events are reconnected or preserved during figure clearing operations
- The difference in behavior between Button and RangeSlider callbacks indicates the problem is specific to the RangeSlider implementation

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lib/matplotlib/widgets.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
lib/matplotlib/figure.py
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `widgets.py` contains the RangeSlider and Button widget implementations, which is central to the issue
- `pyplot.py` contains the `clf()` and `draw()` functions that are triggering the problem
- `figure.py` handles the underlying figure management that's being affected by the clearing and redrawing operations
