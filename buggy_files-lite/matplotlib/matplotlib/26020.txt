Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when trying to create an AxesGrid using cartopy's GeoAxes as the axis_class. It raises a TypeError indicating that a 'method' object is not subscriptable when trying to access `ax.axis["bottom"]`.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error stems from a fundamental difference in how axis attributes are handled between matplotlib's standard Axes and cartopy's GeoAxes:
- In standard matplotlib Axes, the `axis` attribute returns a dict-like object where keys like "bottom" can be accessed
- In cartopy's GeoAxes, the `axis` attribute is just a method/callable
- The `_tick_only` function in axes_grid1 assumes the axis attribute will be dict-like, causing the error when trying to access it with square bracket notation

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the problem, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/matplotlib/axis.py
lib/matplotlib/artist.py
lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py
```

The axis.py file is most important as it defines the core axis behavior that's being accessed differently between matplotlib and cartopy. The artist.py file is relevant as it defines the base Artist class that both types of axes inherit from. pyplot.py is included as it provides the high-level interface for creating and managing plots, including axis handling.
