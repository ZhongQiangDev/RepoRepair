I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem has two related issues:

1. **Japanese Punctuation Issue**: When Japanese punctuation (`、`) is followed by strong syntax (`**`) and code syntax (`` ` ``), the markdown parser fails to correctly parse the formatting. It requires extra spaces to work properly.

2. **Link Inside Strong Delimiter Issue**: When there's a link inside strong delimiters (`**[STRONG](http://abc.com)**`), followed by certain characters (particularly non-ASCII characters like `！` or letters like `M`), the strong formatting breaks.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Both issues appear to be related to how the Marked parser handles certain character sequences, particularly:

1. The parser seems to have trouble recognizing formatting boundaries when they're adjacent to certain non-ASCII characters (like Japanese punctuation).

2. The parser has difficulty with nested elements (links inside strong formatting) when followed by certain characters without spaces.

This suggests the issue is in the tokenization and parsing logic, specifically in how the parser identifies the boundaries of formatting elements.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Lexer.js
src/Parser.js
src/helpers.js
lib/marked.esm.js
```

The issue is most likely in the tokenization and parsing logic. `Tokenizer.js` is the primary file responsible for breaking down markdown into tokens, which is where the issue with recognizing formatting boundaries would be. `Lexer.js` handles the overall parsing flow, while `Parser.js` converts tokens into HTML. The `helpers.js` file contains utility functions that might be involved in character handling. Finally, `marked.esm.js` contains the compiled library code that might need to be updated after fixing the source files.
