I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that task lists (checkboxes like `- [ ] A`) are being rendered as HTML checkboxes even when the `gfm: false` option is set. According to the problem description, when GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) is disabled, task lists should not be rendered as checkboxes but should appear as plain text with the `[ ]` characters visible.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Task lists are a GitHub Flavored Markdown extension, not part of standard CommonMark. When the `gfm` option is set to `false`, all GFM-specific features (including task lists) should be disabled. However, the code is still processing and rendering task lists as HTML checkboxes regardless of this setting.

The issue likely exists in the tokenizer or parser components that handle list items and task lists. The code is probably not checking the `gfm` option before applying task list rendering.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Renderer.js
src/Lexer.js
src/defaults.js
lib/marked.js
```

The issue is most likely in the `Tokenizer.js` file, which handles parsing markdown syntax into tokens, including list items with checkboxes. The `Renderer.js` file would be responsible for converting these tokens into HTML output. The `Lexer.js` file handles the initial tokenization of the markdown text. The `defaults.js` file defines the default options, including the `gfm` setting. Finally, `lib/marked.js` is the compiled version that would need to be rebuilt after the source files are fixed.
