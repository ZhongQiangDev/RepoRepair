I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves image links not rendering properly when the alt text contains escaped square bracket characters (`\[` and `\]`). 

In the example:
```md
[![\[Manny Pacquiao\]](https://img.youtube.com/vi/s6bCmZmy9aQ/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/s6bCmZmy9aQ)
```

The image is not rendering correctly. The demo page shows that when square brackets are escaped in the alt text, the markdown parser fails to properly process the image link.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem appears to be in how the markdown parser handles escaped characters within alt text of image links. When square brackets are escaped with backslashes, the parser is not correctly processing these escape sequences, causing the link structure to break.

This is likely happening in the tokenization/parsing phase where the parser needs to properly handle escaped characters within link and image alt text.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/helpers.js
lib/marked.js
src/Parser.js
src/Lexer.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `src/Tokenizer.js` - Contains the core tokenizing logic including the `link` and `outputLink` functions that process markdown links and images
2. `src/helpers.js` - Contains utility functions including escape/unescape functions that handle character escaping
3. `lib/marked.js` - The compiled library that includes all the parsing logic
4. `src/Parser.js` - Handles the parsing of tokens into HTML output
5. `src/Lexer.js` - Responsible for breaking down the markdown into tokens, including inline tokens like links and images

The fix would likely involve modifying how escaped characters are handled within link and image alt text in these files.
