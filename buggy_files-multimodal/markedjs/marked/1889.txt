I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that lines containing only spaces are being removed in code blocks. This is problematic because:
1. In some programming languages (like Whitespace), spaces are meaningful syntax
2. In real-time editing situations, preserving these space-only lines is important for proper formatting

From the demo links provided, we can see that when a code block contains a line with only spaces, that line is completely removed in the output. The CommonMark demo correctly preserves these lines, but marked.js doesn't.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem is identified in the GitHub issue as occurring in the first line of the `blockTokens` function in the Lexer.js file:
https://github.com/markedjs/marked/blob/c8783a3c1087c5a899ea6c1b96eb8a8e89fcd739/src/Lexer.js#L123

This suggests that there's a line of code that's trimming or removing lines with only spaces, which is appropriate for regular markdown but problematic for code blocks.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information and the problem description, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/Lexer.js
lib/marked.js
lib/marked.esm.js
src/helpers.js
src/defaults.js
```

The primary file is `src/Lexer.js` since it contains the `blockTokens` function mentioned in the issue. The other files are included because they likely contain related code or might need to be updated to support a new option to control this behavior. The minified and ESM versions would also need to be rebuilt after the fix.
