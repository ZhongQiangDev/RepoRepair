I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves a markdown table rendering incorrectly. Specifically, when using the Marked parser (version 0.4.0), a markdown table with cells containing special characters like `|` (pipe) and `[]` (square brackets) is not rendering properly. The screenshot shows that the table is broken, with cells being misaligned or split incorrectly.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue appears to be with how Marked handles escape sequences in markdown tables. In the example, there are cells containing:
- `(route, params, routes, paths) => ReactNode` - contains parentheses
- `object\[]` - contains escaped square brackets
- `string\|ReactNode` - contains an escaped pipe character

The parser is likely not correctly handling these escaped special characters within table cells, causing it to misinterpret the table structure. The pipe character (`|`) is particularly problematic since it's used as a column delimiter in markdown tables.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, the files most likely needing modification to fix this issue are:

```
lib/marked.js
marked.min.js
```

The issue is specifically with the table parsing functionality in the Marked library. The `lib/marked.js` file contains the core implementation, while `marked.min.js` is the minified version that would need to be rebuilt after fixing the core library. The demo file is less relevant as it's just using the library rather than implementing the parsing logic.
