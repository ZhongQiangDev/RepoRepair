Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Adding `rel="noopener"` to `mailto:` links causes them to break on Chrome for Android and iOS Safari
- Specifically, links with `mailto:` protocol and `rel="noopener"` fail to launch the email client on mobile devices

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the audit that enforces `rel="noopener"` on all links with `target="_blank"`
- However, `mailto:` links are special protocol links that don't actually open new windows/tabs in the traditional sense
- The audit is incorrectly flagging `mailto:` links as needing the `noopener` attribute, which interferes with their normal functionality on mobile devices

3. Most Related Files:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/anchors-with-no-rel-noopener.js
lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js
lighthouse-core/audits/accessibility/link-name.js
lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
1. `external-anchors-use-rel-noopener.js` is the main audit file that enforces the noopener requirement
2. `anchors-with-no-rel-noopener.js` gathers the anchor elements for analysis
3. `url-shim.js` handles URL validation and protocol checking
4. `link-name.js` provides additional link validation functionality
5. `driver.js` coordinates the gathering and auditing process

The fix would likely need to modify these files to exclude `mailto:` protocol links from the noopener requirement.
