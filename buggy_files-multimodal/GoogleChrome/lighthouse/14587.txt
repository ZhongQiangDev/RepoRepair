Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running Lighthouse on a real mobile device (Moto Power G), the report incorrectly shows "Emulated Moto G4" instead of indicating it's running on a real device.
- This happens even though the user disabled screen emulation and user agent emulation with the flags `--screenEmulation.disabled` and `--no-emulatedUserAgent`.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how Lighthouse reports the device information in its output.
- Even though emulation is disabled through CLI flags, the report generator is not properly reflecting that this is a real device test rather than an emulated one.
- The core issue likely lies in how the report generator handles device information and emulation settings.

3. Most Related Files:
```
report/generator/report-generator.js
core/config/config.js
cli/cli-flags.js
core/lib/emulation.js
report/renderer/report-renderer.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `report/generator/report-generator.js` is responsible for generating the final report output and likely contains the logic for how device information is displayed
- `core/config/config.js` handles configuration resolution including emulation settings
- `cli/cli-flags.js` processes the CLI flags that disable emulation
- `core/lib/emulation.js` contains the core emulation logic and settings
- `report/renderer/report-renderer.js` handles how the report is rendered and displayed

The fix would likely need to modify how device information is processed and displayed when emulation is disabled through these files.
