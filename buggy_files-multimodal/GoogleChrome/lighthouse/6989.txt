Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Warnings within "Passed Audits" section are not visible enough to users
- The warnings need to be displayed in a dedicated block following the "Passed Audits" section for better visibility

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how audit results are rendered in the HTML report
- Specifically, it involves how warnings are handled and displayed when they occur within passed audits
- This is primarily a UI rendering issue in the report generation system

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/category-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/details-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-ui-features.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/util.js
lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js
```

Reasoning:
- `category-renderer.js` is most important as it handles rendering of audit categories and their results, including passed audits
- `details-renderer.js` is responsible for rendering detailed audit information, including warnings
- `report-ui-features.js` manages UI features and interactions in the report
- `renderer/util.js` provides utility functions for report rendering
- `audits/audit.js` contains base audit functionality that may influence how warnings are processed

These files would need to be modified to implement the proposed warning block following the "Passed Audits" section.
