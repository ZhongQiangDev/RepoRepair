Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Increased error rate on the LR backend
- Higher latency in loadPage timing
- The `lh:runner:auditing` timing remains flat while `loadPage-defaultPass` shows significant jumps
- More sites hitting the 35s maxWaitForLoad timeout leading to 60s render timeout

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to waiting for First Contentful Paint (FCP) during tracing
- The PR #6944 "core(driver): waitForFCP when tracing" is identified as the likely cause
- NO_FCP is the most commonly seen LighthouseError
- The combination of waiting for FCP and the existing timeouts is causing more failures

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the cause, these files are most relevant to fixing the timeout and FCP waiting issues:

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gather-runner.js
lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
lighthouse-core/computed/trace-of-tab.js
clients/lightrider-entry.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- gather-runner.js handles the core gathering process including timeouts and tracing
- first-contentful-paint.js (computed) contains the core FCP computation logic
- first-contentful-paint.js (audits) handles FCP auditing and scoring
- trace-of-tab.js manages trace events and timing validation
- lightrider-entry.js is the entry point for LightRider which is where the errors are being observed
