Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The numbers in the application are not being displayed with proper formatting for thousands separators and decimal places. The example shows that numbers like "1234.5" should be displayed as "1,234.5" using locale-aware formatting.

2. Cause Analysis:
The application is directly outputting raw numbers without using JavaScript's `toLocaleString()` method, which would provide proper number formatting according to the user's locale. This affects various number outputs including metrics, element counts, diagnostics, and file sizes.

lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js
lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/dom-size.js
lighthouse-core/lib/traces/pwmetrics-events.js
```

Reasoning for selection:
- `handlebar-helpers.js` is most important as it contains the templating helpers that format numbers for display
- `report-renderer.js` handles the actual rendering of reports including number formatting
- `audit.js` is the base class for audits that generate numerical results
- `dom-size.js` outputs numerical metrics about DOM elements
- `pwmetrics-events.js` handles performance metrics that need numerical formatting
