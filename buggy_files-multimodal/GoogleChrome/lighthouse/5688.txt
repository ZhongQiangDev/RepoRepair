Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Lighthouse is not flagging BMP images under the "serve images under next gen formats" audit
- Specifically, a BMP image (https://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~ece533/images/sails.bmp) is not being identified as needing conversion to a more modern format

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue likely stems from the image format detection and optimization recommendation logic in Lighthouse
- BMP files should be identified as legacy formats that could benefit from conversion to modern formats like WebP
- The core functionality would be in the image optimization audits and gatherers

3. Most Related Files:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-webp-images.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/optimized-images.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-optimized-images.js
lighthouse-core/gather/computed/metrics/lantern-speed-index.js
lighthouse-core/config/config.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `uses-webp-images.js` is most important as it directly handles WebP conversion recommendations
- `optimized-images.js` gatherer identifies and analyzes image formats for optimization
- `uses-optimized-images.js` provides general image optimization audits
- `lantern-speed-index.js` helps evaluate performance impact of image loading
- `config.js` contains configuration settings that might need updating to include BMP in optimization checks

These files would need to be modified to properly identify and flag BMP images as candidates for conversion to modern formats.
