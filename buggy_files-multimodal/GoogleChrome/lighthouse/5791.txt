Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and screenshot, there appears to be a visual squishing/compression of the "Redirects opportunity" section in the report. The content appears to be improperly formatted or compressed in the UI.

2. Cause Analysis:
Based on the screenshot and repository information, this appears to be a UI rendering issue specifically related to how opportunity sections are displayed in the performance report. The issue likely stems from either:
- Incorrect styling/layout in the performance category renderer
- Improper handling of opportunity metrics in the report renderer
- Issues with the responsive design handling in the report UI features

3. Most Related Files (ordered by relevance):

lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-ui-features.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/render-blocking-resources.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/response-compression.js
```

The performance-category-renderer.js is most critical as it directly handles rendering of opportunities in the performance section. The report-renderer.js and report-ui-features.js handle overall report layout and UI behavior. The render-blocking-resources.js and response-compression.js files are included as they relate to opportunity metrics that could affect the display.
