Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Critical Request Chain sizes are incorrectly displayed
- All requests in the chain show the same size
- The sizes don't match the actual resource sizes
- This issue appears in both Chrome Canary and Chrome Extension versions of Lighthouse

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how transfer sizes are calculated or displayed in the Critical Request Chain visualization
- Since all sizes are identical, there's likely a bug in either:
  - The gathering of request size data during network recording
  - The processing of request sizes in the critical request chain audit
  - The rendering of size information in the report

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-recorder.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/chrome-console-messages.js
```

Reasoning:
- `critical-request-chains.js` is the main audit file that processes and evaluates critical request chains
- `crc-details-renderer.js` handles the visualization and display of the chain data
- `critical-request-chains.js` (computed) processes the network records into chain structures
- `network-recorder.js` handles the actual recording of network requests and their sizes
- `chrome-console-messages.js` may provide additional debugging information about network requests

The issue is most likely in either the audit or renderer files since the problem appears to be with how the sizes are displayed rather than the actual network recording.
