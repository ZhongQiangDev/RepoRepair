Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the screenshots, there appears to be a runtime error design issue where error messages are not properly formatted or displayed in a user-friendly way.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue seems to be related to how runtime errors are handled, formatted and displayed in the UI. Based on the screenshots, the error presentation needs improvement in terms of styling and organization. This would involve both the error handling logic and the UI rendering components.

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository information, these files are most relevant to handling and displaying runtime errors:

```
core/lib/lh-error.js
report/renderer/logger.js
core/lib/sentry.js
core/audits/errors-in-console.js
core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
```

Reasoning:
- lh-error.js: Core error handling class that defines how errors are structured
- logger.js: Handles how messages including errors are displayed in the UI
- sentry.js: Manages error reporting and formatting
- errors-in-console.js: Audits and processes console errors
- i18n.js: Handles message formatting and localization which affects error display

These files together control how errors are captured, processed, and ultimately displayed to users.
