Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and screenshot, the problem is that i18n (internationalization) text is not being translated when running the Lighthouse CLI with the command `node lighthouse-cli www.example.com --view`. The text appears as raw message IDs instead of translated strings.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to the i18n system not properly processing or loading translations when running Lighthouse through the CLI. This would involve:
- Message loading/processing
- Locale detection/handling
- Translation application in CLI output

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js
lighthouse-cli/bin.js
lighthouse-core/config/config.js
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/locales.js
```

Reasoning:
- `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js` is the core i18n handling module that manages message formatting and translation
- `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js` handles locale switching which could be failing
- `lighthouse-cli/bin.js` is the CLI entry point where the command is processed
- `lighthouse-core/config/config.js` handles configuration including i18n settings
- `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/locales.js` would contain the actual translations

These files represent the critical path for i18n functionality in the CLI context where the issue is occurring.
