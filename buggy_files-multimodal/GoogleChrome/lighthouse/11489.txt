Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- In the 'Large JavaScript libraries' view, the 'Transfer size' column values omit decimal places for round sizes (e.g., showing "18 KiB" instead of "18.0 KiB")
- This makes it harder for visually impaired users to compare numbers across rows since digit columns don't line up consistently

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the number formatting logic for file sizes
- The formatting is likely dropping trailing zeros after the decimal point
- This is primarily a display/formatting issue rather than a calculation issue
- The problem would be in the code that handles size formatting and display in the JavaScript libraries view

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/large-javascript-libraries.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/i18n.js
lighthouse-core/lib/statistics.js
lighthouse-core/scoring.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/byte-efficiency-audit.js
```

Reasoning:
- `large-javascript-libraries.js` is the main audit file that handles the display of JavaScript library sizes
- `i18n.js` contains the formatting functions for numbers and bytes
- `statistics.js` contains utility functions for number handling
- `scoring.js` has functions for decimal clamping and number formatting
- `byte-efficiency-audit.js` contains base functionality for byte measurements and display

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in the first two files to ensure consistent decimal place display.
