Let me analyze this step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- iframes are being incorrectly considered as "critical" requests in the critical request chains (CRC) tree
- data URIs are being included in the CRC tree when they shouldn't be since they aren't actual network requests

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue lies in how critical requests are identified and filtered in the dependency graph construction
- iframes, while loaded with high priority, don't actually block rendering
- data URIs are internal resources that don't make network requests, so they shouldn't be part of critical request chains
- The filtering logic in the critical request chains computation needs to be updated to exclude these types of resources

3. Most Related Files:
```
lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js
lighthouse-core/gather/computed/page-dependency-graph.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `critical-request-chains.js` (computed) contains the core logic for determining what constitutes a critical request
2. `network-node.js` handles the network request classification and properties
3. `page-dependency-graph.js` builds the dependency relationships between requests
4. `crc-details-renderer.js` handles the visualization of the chains
5. `critical-request-chains.js` (audits) performs the actual audit using the computed chains

The fix would primarily involve modifying the filtering logic in the first file to exclude iframes and data URIs from being considered critical requests.
