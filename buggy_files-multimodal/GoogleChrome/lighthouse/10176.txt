Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Duplicate stack packs are appearing in the Lighthouse report for React libraries
- New experimental "React (Fast Path)" entries are showing up in the bestpractices/js-libraries audit when they shouldn't be visible to users

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from new "Fast Path" checks added to js-lib-detector and integrated into Lighthouse
- The duplicate stack packs occur due to loose coupling in stack collection, specifically in how library IDs are matched
- The visibility of experimental "Fast Path" entries is due to lack of filtering in the js-libraries audit display logic

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-packs.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/util.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/js-usage.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- stack-collector.js handles the core library detection and stack collection logic where the duplication occurs
- js-libraries.js contains the audit that's incorrectly displaying the experimental entries
- stack-packs.js manages how stack packs are filtered and displayed
- util.js contains utility functions for report rendering that could affect how libraries are displayed
- js-usage.js gathers JavaScript usage data that feeds into the library detection process
