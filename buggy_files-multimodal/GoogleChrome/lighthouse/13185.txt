Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Thumbnail images in reports are hotlinking directly to remote servers
- This creates CSP/mixed content issues when reports are shown over HTTPS
- The report already has a full page screenshot (fpss) that could be used instead

2. Cause Analysis:
- The report is creating `<img>` elements that link directly to external image URLs
- This is happening for type=thumbnail items
- Instead of using external URLs, the report should use sections from the full page screenshot that's already captured
- This would avoid mixed content warnings and CSP issues by keeping all assets local

3. Most Related Files:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/screenshot-thumbnails.js
lighthouse-core/computed/screenshots.js
lighthouse-core/audits/full-page-screenshot.js
report/renderer/element-screenshot-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/full-page-screenshot.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- screenshot-thumbnails.js directly handles the creation and processing of thumbnails
- screenshots.js manages screenshot data collection and processing
- full-page-screenshot.js contains the audit logic for full page screenshots that should be used instead
- element-screenshot-renderer.js handles rendering of screenshots in the report
- full-page-screenshot.js gatherer captures the full page screenshot that will be used as the source

These files would need to be modified to change how thumbnails are generated and rendered, switching from external URLs to using sections of the full page screenshot.
