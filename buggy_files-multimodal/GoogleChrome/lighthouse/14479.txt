Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The DOM size audit is showing decimal places (`.0`) for values that should be integers, as shown in the screenshot. This is unnecessarily precise since DOM element counts are always whole numbers.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to number formatting in the audit results, specifically for DOM size metrics. The values are likely being processed through a general number formatting function that retains decimal places, even when they're not needed. Since DOM counts are always integers, this extra precision is unnecessary and potentially confusing.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
core/audits/dobetterweb/dom-size.js
core/lib/i18n.js
report/renderer/i18n.js
core/audits/audit.js
core/scoring.js
```

Reasoning:
- `dom-size.js` is the primary file handling DOM statistics and metrics
- `i18n.js` files handle number formatting and display
- `audit.js` contains base audit functionality that might affect how numbers are displayed
- `scoring.js` includes number formatting utilities that could affect the display of metrics

The fix would likely involve modifying how these integer values are formatted, particularly in the DOM stats audit or the i18n formatting logic.
