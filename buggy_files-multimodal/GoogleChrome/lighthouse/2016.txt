Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the screenshot, when there are 0 passing audits, a details dropdown is still being shown, which is unnecessary since there are no passing items to display.

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be a UI rendering issue where the dropdown for showing passed items is being displayed even when there are no passed items to show. This is likely happening in the report rendering logic where the condition for showing/hiding the dropdown isn't properly checking for zero passing audits.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue, ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/report/report-generator.js
lighthouse-core/report/scripts/logger.js
```

The main file `report-renderer.js` is most critical as it handles the rendering logic for audit results and likely contains the condition for showing/hiding the passed items dropdown. The `report-generator.js` file is second as it orchestrates the overall report generation process. The `logger.js` file might be involved in displaying UI elements but is less central to this specific issue.

These files would need to be modified to ensure the dropdown is only shown when there are actually passing audits to display.
