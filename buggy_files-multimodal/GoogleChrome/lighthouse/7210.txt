Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Lighthouse/PageSpeed is reporting a size of 80kb and potential savings of ~70kb for CSS when the actual gzipped JSON containing the CSS is only around 20kb.
- The tool is incorrectly calculating the potential savings based on the uncompressed size in the DOM rather than the actual transferred size.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how Lighthouse calculates CSS size and compression savings
- It's using the uncompressed size of CSS in the DOM rather than considering the actual network transfer size after gzip compression
- The compression ratio estimation for CSS appears to be too pessimistic, leading to inflated potential savings calculations

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unused-css-rules.js
lighthouse-core/lib/minification-estimator.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/byte-efficiency-audit.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/network-analyzer.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- unused-css-rules.js: Directly handles CSS usage analysis and savings calculations
- minification-estimator.js: Contains logic for estimating compressed sizes
- byte-efficiency-audit.js: Base class for byte efficiency audits including compression calculations
- network-analyzer.js: Analyzes network requests and transfer sizes
- network-request.js: Handles network request data including compression information

The core issue likely needs to be addressed in these files to properly account for gzip compression ratios when calculating potential CSS savings.
