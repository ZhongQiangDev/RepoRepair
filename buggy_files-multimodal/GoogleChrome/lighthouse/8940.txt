Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Lighthouse reports a potential saving of 53KB for an image (spritesheet2.png) that is currently 54KB in size
- The user has already tried minifying the image through optimization websites without success

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to image sizing rather than just compression
- Lighthouse is likely detecting that the image is being displayed at dimensions smaller than its natural size
- This means the browser has to download a larger image than necessary and scale it down for display
- The 53KB savings suggestion indicates Lighthouse believes the image could be served at a more appropriate resolution for its display size

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/image-elements.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/byte-efficiency-audit.js
lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/performance-category-renderer.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `uses-responsive-images.js` directly handles the audit for detecting improperly sized images
- `image-elements.js` gathers information about image elements including their natural and display dimensions
- `byte-efficiency-audit.js` provides the base functionality for calculating potential byte savings
- `asset-saver.js` handles the processing and analysis of image assets
- `performance-category-renderer.js` generates the report output showing the potential savings
