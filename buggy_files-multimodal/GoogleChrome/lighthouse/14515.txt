Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Lighthouse report's meta information block (shown in tooltip) is missing emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor information
- Currently only shows CPU/Memory power information

2. Cause Analysis:
- The meta information block in the report renderer isn't including screen emulation settings from the Lighthouse configuration
- These settings (screen dimensions, deviceScaleFactor) are available in the Lighthouse results but not being passed through to the report's meta block
- The issue appears to be in the report rendering logic, specifically where the meta information tooltip is generated

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files for fixing this issue would be:

```
report/renderer/report-renderer.js
core/lib/emulation.js
report/generator/report-generator.js
types/lhr/settings.d.ts
core/config/config-helpers.js
```

Reasoning:
- `report/renderer/report-renderer.js` is most important as it contains the `_renderMetaBlock` method that generates the tooltip content
- `core/lib/emulation.js` handles screen emulation settings and device metrics
- `report/generator/report-generator.js` is responsible for generating the overall report structure
- `types/lhr/settings.d.ts` defines the types for screen emulation settings that need to be included
- `core/config/config-helpers.js` helps process configuration settings including emulation parameters

These files would need to be modified to properly pass and display the screen emulation information in the report's meta block.
