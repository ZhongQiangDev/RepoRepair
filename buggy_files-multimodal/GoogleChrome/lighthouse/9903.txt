Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- After adding preconnect hints for required origins, Lighthouse continues suggesting additional origins that need preconnect hints
- The user is confused about why Lighthouse keeps suggesting more origins even after implementing the initial suggestions
- There's uncertainty about the maximum number of preconnect hints that should be added

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how Lighthouse evaluates preconnect opportunities and prioritizes origins
- The audit likely identifies high-impact third-party origins based on connection setup times and resource importance
- As initial preconnects are added, other origins become more significant in the performance impact calculation
- The 6 preconnect limit mentioned is a browser recommendation, not a hard limit in Lighthouse's audit

3. Most Related Files:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/uses-rel-preconnect.js
lighthouse-core/computed/network-records.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/network-analyzer.js
lighthouse-core/computed/network-analysis.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/tcp-connection.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `uses-rel-preconnect.js` is the main audit file that determines which origins need preconnect hints
- `network-records.js` processes and provides network request data for analysis
- `network-analyzer.js` analyzes connection patterns and identifies important origins
- `network-analysis.js` computes network metrics and RTT times used in determining preconnect candidates
- `tcp-connection.js` simulates connection behavior to evaluate the impact of preconnects
