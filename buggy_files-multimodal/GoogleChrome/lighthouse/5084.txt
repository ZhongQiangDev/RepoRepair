Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- ByteEfficiency reports no savings (100 score) for animated GIF->video conversion cases even though there was almost 5MB of potential savings.
- The `computeWasteWithTTIGraph` reports 0 savings because there's only 1 network request affected and no long tasks touched.
- However, the actual difference in load time is 23 seconds.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The current implementation only considers the impact on Time to Interactive (TTI) when calculating savings.
- For single large requests like GIFs that don't affect CPU tasks, the current method fails to capture the true performance impact.
- The suggestion is to calculate impact based on either:
  a) End of graph timing difference
  b) Onload timing difference
Both would better reflect the actual savings from GIF optimization.

3. Most Related Files:
```
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/simulator.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/efficient-animated-content.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/network-analyzer.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/byte-efficiency-audit.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. simulator.js contains the core simulation logic that calculates timing impacts
2. efficient-animated-content.js handles the specific GIF optimization audit
3. network-analyzer.js analyzes network requests and their timing impacts
4. network-node.js represents network requests in the dependency graph
5. byte-efficiency-audit.js provides the base functionality for byte efficiency calculations

The fix would likely need to modify how savings are calculated in these files to consider end-of-graph or onload timing differences rather than just TTI impact.
