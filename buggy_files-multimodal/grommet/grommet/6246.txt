I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with DataChart not rendering bars when data includes negative values.

## Analysis of the Problem

1. **Wrong Behavior**: DataChart cannot render bars when data includes negative values. Instead of showing a chart with a zero line guide and properly rendered negative bars, the chart shows nothing.

2. **Expected Behavior**: 
   - The chart should display a zero line guide when data includes negative values
   - Negative values should be properly rendered as bars below the zero line
   - Users should be able to customize attributes (colors) of negative values

3. **Cause Analysis**:
   Based on the screenshots and description, this appears to be an issue with how the DataChart component handles negative values in bar charts. The component likely doesn't properly calculate or render bars when values go below zero. This could be related to:
   - Calculation of bounds and axes
   - Rendering logic for bars with negative values
   - Missing zero line implementation when negative values are present

## Most Related Files

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js
src/js/components/Chart/calcs.js
src/js/components/Chart/Chart.js
src/js/components/Chart/utils.js
src/js/components/DataChart/XAxis.js
```

The `DataChart.js` file is the main component that needs fixing as it's responsible for rendering the chart. The `calcs.js` file handles calculations for bounds and axes which is critical for properly handling negative values. The `Chart.js` file contains the core rendering logic that might need adjustment. The `utils.js` file has utility functions for normalization and bounds that could affect negative value handling. Finally, `XAxis.js` would need to be checked for proper zero line rendering when negative values are present.
