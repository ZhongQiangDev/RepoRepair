I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The problem is that in Safari, the search input field in the Select component is very small, with padding being ignored. This is visible in the screenshot comparison between Safari and Chrome.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
In v1, this was solved by adding CSS `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` for `<input type='search' />`. This suggests that Safari has a default styling for search inputs that's causing the padding to be ignored, and we need to override this default styling.

## 3. Files most related to the cause
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/js/components/Select/Select.js
src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js
src/js/components/TextInput/StyledTextInput.js
src/js/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
src/js/utils/styles.js
```

The issue is primarily with the Select component's search input in Safari, so the Select.js and SelectContainer.js files are most important as they handle the rendering and behavior of the select dropdown and its search functionality. 

The TextInput components are likely used for the search input within the Select component, and the StyledTextInput.js file would contain the styling that needs to be modified to add the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` CSS property.

Finally, styles.js might contain utility functions for styling that could be used across components, including the search input in the Select component.
