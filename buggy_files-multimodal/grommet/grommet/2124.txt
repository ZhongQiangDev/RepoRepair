I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the Calendar display issue in IE11.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that the Grommet2 Calendar component is broken in IE11. The screenshot shows a calendar with misaligned or improperly rendered elements, suggesting a layout or styling issue specific to Internet Explorer 11.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the repository information, this is likely related to:
1. CSS styling or flexbox issues that work in modern browsers but not in IE11
2. JavaScript features used in the Calendar component that aren't fully supported in IE11
3. Potentially missing polyfills or IE11-specific workarounds

Looking at the screenshot, the calendar appears to have layout issues where elements aren't positioned correctly. This is a common problem with IE11, which has incomplete or buggy support for modern CSS features like flexbox, grid layouts, and certain CSS properties.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js
src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js
src/js/components/Calendar/utils.js
src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js
src/js/components/Grid/StyledGrid.js
```

These files are most likely to need editing because:

1. `src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js` - This contains the styling for the Calendar component, which is likely where the IE11-specific CSS issues exist. The file includes functions for styling calendar elements, which may need IE11-specific adjustments.

2. `src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js` - This is the main Calendar component implementation. It may need conditional rendering or feature detection for IE11.

3. `src/js/components/Calendar/utils.js` - Contains utility functions for the Calendar, which might need adjustments for IE11 compatibility.

4. `src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js` - The Box component is a fundamental layout component in Grommet, and the Calendar likely uses it extensively. IE11 issues with flexbox would need to be addressed here.

5. `src/js/components/Grid/StyledGrid.js` - If the Calendar uses Grid for layout, this file would need IE11-specific fixes as Grid layouts are particularly problematic in IE11.
