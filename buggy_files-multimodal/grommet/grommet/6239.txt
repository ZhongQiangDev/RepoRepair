I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that tabs underlines (margin bottom) are not sticking to the bottom of the tab content when the tab is used in a section with fixed height. This behavior was working correctly in Grommet 2.24.0 but broke after the new feature introduced in PR #6137 (in Grommet 2.25.0).

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the screenshots and description, the issue appears to be related to how the Tab component handles scrollable content within a fixed height container. The underlines that should remain fixed at the bottom of the tab header are now scrolling with the content.

The problem was introduced after PR #6137, which likely changed how tabs handle overflow or positioning of elements. This suggests that the issue is related to the Tab component's styling or layout logic, particularly how it handles scrollable content and fixed positioning of the underline/border.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/js/components/Tab/StyledTab.js
src/js/components/Tab/Tab.js
src/js/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
src/js/components/Tabs/StyledTabs.js
src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js
```

The issue is most likely in the Tab and Tabs components, particularly in their styled components which handle the positioning and styling of the tab underlines. The Box component's styling is also relevant as it likely affects how content is positioned and scrolled within fixed-height containers.
