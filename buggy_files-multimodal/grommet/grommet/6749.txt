I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files needed to implement a `DataTableGroup` component.

## Wrong Behavior Analysis
The issue is not about wrong behavior but rather a missing feature. The user is requesting a new component called `DataTableGroup` that would provide a control to select the `groupBy` value for a `DataTable` component. Currently, users need to implement this functionality manually using a `Select` component, as shown in the screenshots.

## Cause Analysis
The Grommet library has many `Data` related components, but lacks a dedicated component for controlling the `groupBy` property of a `DataTable`. Users currently need to create their own implementation using a `Select` component, which leads to inconsistent implementations and duplicated code across projects.

## Most Related Files
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files for implementing a `DataTableGroup` component:

```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
src/js/components/DataTableColumns/DataTableColumns.js
src/js/components/DataView/index.d.ts
src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js
src/js/components/Select/index.d.ts
```

These files are most important because:

1. `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js` - This is the main DataTable component that accepts the `groupBy` prop. Understanding how it handles grouping is essential for creating a component to control this property.

2. `src/js/components/DataTableColumns/DataTableColumns.js` - This is a similar component that provides controls for column selection and ordering. It would serve as a good reference for implementing the DataTableGroup component with a similar pattern and API.

3. `src/js/components/DataView/index.d.ts` - Contains type definitions for Data components, which would be useful for ensuring the new DataTableGroup component follows the same patterns.

4. `src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js` - Since the DataTableGroup would likely use a Select component internally (as shown in the screenshots), understanding this implementation is important.

5. `src/js/components/Select/index.d.ts` - Contains type definitions for the Select component, which would be needed to properly integrate it into the new DataTableGroup component.
