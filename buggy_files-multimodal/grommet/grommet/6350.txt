I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that when both `action` and `onOrder` properties are used together in a `List` component, the action is not properly aligned with the rest of the list. As shown in the screenshots:
- With `onOrder`: The action is misaligned
- Without `onOrder`: The action is properly aligned

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the description and screenshots, this appears to be a layout/styling issue where the presence of the `onOrder` property is affecting the alignment of the `action` property. This suggests there might be a conflict in how these two properties are handled in the component's layout structure.

The issue is likely in the `List` component's implementation, specifically in how it handles the layout when both `action` and `onOrder` properties are present.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/List/List.js
src/js/components/List/stories/Action.js
src/js/components/List/stories/Order.js
src/js/components/List/index.d.ts
src/js/components/List/propTypes.js
```

The `List.js` file is the most important as it contains the core implementation of the List component and likely handles both the `action` and `onOrder` properties. The issue is probably in how these properties interact in the layout logic.

The `Action.js` and `Order.js` story files demonstrate the individual behaviors of these properties, which would be helpful for understanding how they're supposed to work separately.

The TypeScript definition file (`index.d.ts`) and `propTypes.js` would provide information about how these properties are defined and what their expected behavior should be.
