I'll analyze the problem with the RadioButtons component where the background color is being applied to all radio buttons instead of just the checked one.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that when setting a background color for checked radio buttons using:
```javascript
radioButton: {    
  check: {
    color: '#fff',
    background:{
      color: '#3b5ed8'
    }
  }
}
```
The blue background color is being applied to all radio buttons in the group, not just the currently checked one.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the repository information, this appears to be an issue with how the styling for the RadioButton component is being applied. The problem is likely in the styling logic that determines when to apply the background color from the theme. The background color styling is probably being applied unconditionally to all radio buttons rather than being conditionally applied only when the radio button is in a checked state.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js
src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
src/js/themes/base.js
```

The most important file is `src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js` because it contains the styling logic for radio buttons, including the function that applies the background color (function #8 "Checkmark Background Color"). This is where the conditional logic for applying the background color only to checked radio buttons would need to be fixed.

The second most important file is `src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js` which contains the main component implementation and determines how props like `checked` are passed to the styled components.

The third file is `src/js/themes/base.js` which defines the default theme structure for components, including the RadioButton component, and may provide insight into how the theme properties should be structured and applied.
