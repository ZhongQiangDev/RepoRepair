I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is with the DataTable component's sorting functionality:
- When clicking on table headers to sort columns, the URL changes correctly and the sorting arrows in the header display correctly
- However, when using browser navigation (back/forward buttons), the URL changes correctly but the sorting arrows in the header don't update to reflect the new URL state

## Analyzing the Cause
This is a classic issue with browser navigation and state management. When using browser back/forward buttons:
1. The URL changes correctly (since that's handled by the browser)
2. But the component's internal state for sorting doesn't update to reflect the new URL parameters
3. The sorting arrows in the header are tied to the component's internal state rather than being derived from the URL

The component needs to listen for URL/history changes and update its internal sorting state accordingly when browser navigation occurs.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js
src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js
src/js/utils/DOM.js
src/js/components/DataTable/Body.js
```

The primary issue is in `DataTable.js` which manages the sorting state and should listen for URL/history changes. The `Header.js` and `Sorter.js` files are responsible for rendering the sorting arrows based on the current sort state. `DOM.js` might be needed for any browser history/navigation event handling, and `Body.js` would be affected by sorting changes.
