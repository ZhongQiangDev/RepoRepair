I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

### Wrong Behavior
The PageHeader component's heading with a long string overflows rather than breaking, causing it to collide with other content.

### Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be that the PageHeader component doesn't properly handle text wrapping for long headings. When user-generated content (which can be unpredictable in length) is passed as a heading, it should wrap to the next line when it runs out of space, but instead it's overflowing its container.

Looking at the screenshot, we can see that the heading text extends beyond its allocated space and overlaps with other UI elements. This suggests that the component is missing proper CSS styling for text wrapping, such as `word-break`, `overflow-wrap`, or `white-space` properties.

The most likely files to edit would be those related to the PageHeader component, particularly its styling files and the component implementation itself.

## Files to Edit

```
src/js/components/PageHeader/PageHeader.js
src/js/components/Heading/StyledHeading.js
src/js/components/PageHeader/index.d.ts
src/js/components/Heading/Heading.js
src/js/components/Text/StyledText.js
```

The PageHeader.js file is the main component implementation and would need to be modified to handle text wrapping properly. The StyledHeading.js file contains the styling for headings and would need CSS properties to handle overflow. The index.d.ts file defines the types for the PageHeader component and might need updates if we add new props to control text wrapping. The Heading.js file is the implementation of the Heading component used within PageHeader, and StyledText.js might be relevant if the heading text styling is inherited from there.
