Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Typed start events (events with specific event definitions) are being allowed inside non-event based sub-processes, which violates BPMN rules
- The issue is demonstrated in the GIF where a start event can be morphed into a typed event inside a sub-process

2. Cause Analysis:
- The modeling rules are not properly enforcing restrictions on start event types within sub-processes
- Two specific behaviors need to be controlled:
  a. Preventing morphing of start events to typed events when inside a sub-process
  b. Removing event type when moving a start event into a sub-process
- This requires changes to both the rules validation and element behavior handling

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
```

Reasoning:
- `BpmnRules.js` is primary since it handles all BPMN validation rules and needs to enforce the restriction on typed events in sub-processes
- `ReplaceElementBehaviour.js` manages element replacement behavior which is crucial for morphing operations
- `BpmnFactory.js` creates BPMN elements and needs to handle event definitions correctly
- `ReplaceMenuProvider.js` controls what replacement options are available in the context menu
- `BpmnReplace.js` handles the actual replacement logic when morphing elements
