Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The direct editing box remains open when switching between planes in a BPMN diagram, even though the element being edited is no longer visible. This creates a confusing user experience as the editing interface persists without its associated element.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to the direct editing feature not being properly canceled when navigating between different planes in the diagram. When a plane switch occurs, the system should detect this change and automatically close any active direct editing interfaces. This is likely a missing cleanup step in the direct editing or plane navigation logic.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingPreview.js
lib/util/DrilldownUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js
```

Reasoning:
- LabelEditingProvider.js is most important as it manages direct editing of labels and should handle cleanup when context changes
- DrilldownCentering.js handles plane navigation and should trigger events that other components can listen to
- LabelEditingPreview.js manages the visual aspects of label editing and should respond to plane changes
- DrilldownUtil.js contains utility functions for plane-related operations that might be involved
- SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js manages subprocess planes and their behavior, which could affect editing state

The fix would likely involve modifying LabelEditingProvider.js to listen for plane change events and cancel any active direct editing operations when they occur.
