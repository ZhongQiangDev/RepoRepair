Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GIF and description, when a process is wrapped in a pool, the diagram jumps/shifts position unexpectedly instead of staying in the current viewport.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to viewport positioning and diagram centering behavior when elements are wrapped in a pool (Participant). When a process is converted to a collaboration by wrapping it in a pool, the diagram's root element changes, which triggers repositioning logic that doesn't maintain the current viewport position.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling this behavior:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateParticipantBehavior.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateCanvasRootHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/BaseViewer.js
```

Reasoning:
- CreateParticipantBehavior.js is most important as it directly handles the creation of participants (pools) and the conversion of processes to collaborations
- DrilldownCentering.js manages viewport positioning when root elements change
- UpdateCanvasRootHandler.js handles root element updates which occur during process-to-collaboration conversion
- BpmnUpdater.js manages diagram updates and parent-child relationships
- BaseViewer.js contains core viewport management functionality

The jumping behavior likely stems from the interaction between these components when the diagram's root element changes during the pool wrapping process.
