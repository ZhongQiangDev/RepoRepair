Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When removing a child lane from a parent lane in a BPMN diagram, the diagram becomes deformed
- After removal, the diagram cannot be edited properly
- This issue occurs in v5.x and v6.x but works fine in v3.0.1 and v4.0.1

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to lane management and resizing behavior after deletion
- When a child lane is removed, the parent lane and remaining child lanes are not properly resized or repositioned
- This suggests problems with:
  - Lane deletion handling
  - Parent lane resizing logic
  - Sibling lanes repositioning
  - Layout compensation after deletion

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DeleteLaneBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/util/LaneUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeLaneBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
```

Reasoning:
- `DeleteLaneBehavior.js` directly handles lane deletion and compensating layout changes
- `ResizeLaneHandler.js` manages lane resizing operations which are crucial after deletion
- `LaneUtil.js` provides core utilities for lane manipulation and calculations
- `ResizeLaneBehavior.js` handles the behavior of lane resizing which is needed after deletion
- `UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js` manages flow node references which need to be updated when lanes are modified

The issue likely stems from bugs in the deletion compensation logic in `DeleteLaneBehavior.js` or its interaction with the resizing handlers.
