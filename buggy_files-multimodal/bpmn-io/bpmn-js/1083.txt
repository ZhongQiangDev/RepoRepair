Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- In v4-beta, the docking snapping functionality is not working when connecting elements
- Elements no longer snap to their docking points when being moved or connected
- This is a regression from v3.x where elements would automatically snap to valid docking points

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to snapping behavior during element movement and connection
- Based on the GIF comparison, the snapping logic that helps align elements to docking points is not being triggered or processed correctly
- This likely involves the grid snapping and docking point calculation systems

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository files, these appear most relevant to fixing the docking snapping issue:

```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LineAttachmentUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ImportDockingFix.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
```

The `BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js` is listed first as it's directly responsible for snapping behavior during element creation and movement. `LineAttachmentUtil.js` handles connection point calculations, while `ImportDockingFix.js` manages docking point corrections. The other files support these operations through flow node references and element factory operations.
