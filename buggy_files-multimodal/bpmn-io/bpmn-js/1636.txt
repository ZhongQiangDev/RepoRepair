Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When morphing a call activity to a subprocess, the resulting subprocess appears as a tiny shape without a start event, unlike when morphing from a task which correctly includes a start event.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the subprocess creation behavior during morphing operations. When morphing from a call activity, the code is not applying the same behavior as when morphing from a task, specifically missing the automatic addition of a start event. This is likely related to the modeling behavior rules and subprocess creation handlers.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
```

Reasoning:
- `SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js` is most important as it directly handles the addition of start events to subprocesses
- `BpmnUpdater.js` manages updates to BPMN elements during transformations
- `ElementFactory.js` handles the creation of BPMN elements including subprocesses
- `Modeling.js` contains core modeling operations including element transformation
- `BpmnReplace.js` handles the actual replacement/morphing of elements

The fix would likely need to modify `SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js` to ensure it handles morphing from call activities the same way it handles morphing from tasks.
