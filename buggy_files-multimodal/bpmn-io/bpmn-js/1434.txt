Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Typed start events can be copied and pasted onto a subprocess, which should not be allowed
- Similarly, non-interrupting events copied from an event sub-process can also be pasted incorrectly
- This violates BPMN modeling rules as typed start events are not valid within a subprocess

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the copy-paste validation rules for BPMN elements
- The system is not properly checking whether the target location (subprocess) can accept the copied element type (typed start event)
- This suggests a gap in either the BPMN rules enforcement or the copy-paste behavior implementation

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `BpmnCopyPaste.js` is the primary file handling copy-paste operations and should include validation logic
- `BpmnRules.js` contains the rules that determine valid BPMN element placements and relationships
- `ReplaceElementBehaviour.js` manages element replacement behavior which is relevant for paste operations
- `UpdatePropertiesHandler.js` handles property updates during element modifications
- `ReplaceMenuProvider.js` provides context menu options for element replacements and transformations

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in BpmnCopyPaste.js to add validation checks against BpmnRules.js before allowing the paste operation to complete.
