Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When copying a task with an attached boundary event, the copied boundary event is not properly attached to the copied task
- The boundary event appears disconnected from its host task in the copied version
- This breaks the expected parent-child relationship between the boundary event and its host task

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the copy-paste functionality not properly maintaining the attachment relationship between boundary events and their host elements
- The core problem likely lies in how the attachment references and parent-child relationships are handled during the cloning/copying process
- The BpmnCopyPaste behavior needs to ensure that when copying elements with attachments, the relationships are properly preserved in the new copies

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:

1. BpmnCopyPaste.js is the primary file handling copy-paste operations and would need to properly handle attachment relationships during copying

2. AttachEventBehavior.js manages how events get attached to elements, which is crucial for maintaining proper boundary event relationships

3. CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js specifically handles boundary event creation behavior, which would be involved in recreating proper attachments during paste operations

4. BpmnFactory.js creates BPMN elements and their relationships, which would be used during the paste operation

5. DetachEventBehavior.js handles event detachment logic, which provides insight into how attachment relationships work in the system

The fix would likely need to focus on BpmnCopyPaste.js to ensure it properly maintains the attachment relationships when copying elements with boundary events.
