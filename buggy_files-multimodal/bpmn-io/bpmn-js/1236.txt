Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GIF and description, when a Sub Process is collapsed and then converted to an Ad Hoc Sub Process, it gets incorrect dimensions. The dimensions appear to change unexpectedly during this transformation.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to:
- Element resizing behavior during collapse/expand operations
- Element transformation (from regular Sub Process to Ad Hoc Sub Process)
- Dimension preservation during element type changes
- Boundary calculation for collapsed states

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js
lib/features/auto-resize/BpmnAutoResize.js
```

Reasoning:
- ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js is most relevant as it directly handles the collapse/expand behavior and calculates new bounds
- ResizeBehavior.js manages element resizing rules and constraints
- BpmnUpdater.js handles updates to element properties and dimensions
- ResizeLaneHandler.js contains core resizing logic that might affect subprocess dimensions
- BpmnAutoResize.js handles automatic resizing which could interfere with manual dimension changes
