Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The issue is that users cannot easily connect two tasks center-to-center anymore
- The new behavior with connection previews and grid snapping makes it difficult to create direct center-to-center connections between tasks
- This affects a common use case (described as "happy path") in BPMN diagram creation

2. Cause Analysis:
- The introduction of connection previews and grid snapping has changed how connection points are determined
- The grid snapping behavior is interfering with the natural center-point connections
- The connection behavior needs to be modified to prioritize center-to-center connections while maintaining grid snapping functionality
- Based on the GIFs, the connection points are being forced to snap to grid points rather than task centers

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository files, these are most relevant to fixing the connection behavior:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js
lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. LayoutConnectionBehavior.js handles how connections are laid out between elements
2. BpmnGridSnapping.js contains the grid snapping logic that's causing the issue
3. BpmnConnectSnapping.js manages connection point snapping behavior
4. BpmnFactory.js creates and manages BPMN elements including connections
5. UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js handles updates to flow node references which could affect connection behavior

The fix would likely involve modifying the snapping behavior to prioritize center points while maintaining grid snapping for other cases.
