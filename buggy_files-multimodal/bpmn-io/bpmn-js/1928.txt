Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- An empty pool (participant) in BPMN diagram is being resized vertically when using the space tool
- Empty pools should maintain a fixed height to distinguish them from lanes/expanded pools

2. Cause Analysis:
- The space tool is not properly handling the resizing constraints for empty pools
- The behavior suggests that the space tool's resizing logic is not checking if a participant is empty before allowing vertical resizing
- This likely involves the interaction between space tool behavior and BPMN-specific rules for participant resizing

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the issue:

```
lib/features/space-tool/BpmnSpaceTool.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeLaneBehavior.js
```

Reasoning:
- BpmnSpaceTool.js is the main file handling space tool behavior for BPMN elements
- ResizeBehavior.js contains the rules for resizing different BPMN elements including participants
- BpmnRules.js defines what operations are allowed on different BPMN elements
- ResizeLaneHandler.js and ResizeLaneBehavior.js handle the actual resizing of lanes and participants

The fix would likely need to start in BpmnSpaceTool.js to add a check for empty pools and prevent their vertical resizing.
