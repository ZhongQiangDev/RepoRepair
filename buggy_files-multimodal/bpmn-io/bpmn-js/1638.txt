Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When removing a label from a Task in the BPMN diagram, the `di` object still retains the `label` property with a value of `null`
- This causes issues with linting tools since they expect the `label` property to not exist at all when there is no label

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how label properties are handled during removal
- Instead of completely removing the `label` property from the `di` object when clearing a label, the code is only setting it to `null`
- This was introduced when adding support for embedded label DIs
- The root cause appears to be in the label editing and property updating logic

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. UpdatePropertiesHandler.js handles property updates including label changes and is responsible for how properties are set/removed

2. LabelEditingProvider.js manages label editing operations and would be involved in label removal logic

3. BpmnUpdater.js synchronizes the BPMN model with visual changes including label updates

4. LabelUtil.js contains utility functions for label handling and validation

5. UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js handles low-level property updates on the BPMN model elements

The fix would likely need to modify how these components handle label removal to ensure the property is completely removed rather than set to null.
