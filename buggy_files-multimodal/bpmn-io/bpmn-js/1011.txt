Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Group elements (borders) are not being rendered on top of other elements
- When creating a new element on a group's border, the group border appears behind the new element
- This is incorrect as groups should always be rendered on top of all other elements

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a rendering order/z-index issue in the BPMN diagram
- The problem likely lies in the ordering provider that determines which elements should be rendered on top of others
- Groups should have a higher rendering priority than regular elements to ensure their borders remain visible

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/ordering/BpmnOrderingProvider.js
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateCanvasRootHandler.js
```

The `BpmnOrderingProvider.js` is most critical as it directly handles the z-index and rendering order of elements. The `BpmnRenderer.js` is second as it manages the actual rendering process. `BpmnUpdater.js` handles updates to element properties which could affect rendering. `BpmnImporter.js` and `UpdateCanvasRootHandler.js` are also relevant as they deal with element creation and canvas management respectively.
