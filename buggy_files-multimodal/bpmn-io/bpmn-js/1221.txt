Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior is not being applied after copying and pasting elements onto flows. Specifically, when a boundary event with a vertically aligned label is copied and pasted onto a flow with vertical direction, the label's alignment is not updated to match the new context.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to the copy-paste functionality not properly triggering or handling the adaptive label positioning behavior. When elements are pasted, their labels retain their original positioning instead of being recalculated based on their new context. This suggests a disconnect between the copy-paste operation and the label positioning system.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LabelLayoutUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
```

Reasoning:
- AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js is directly responsible for the label positioning behavior that's not being applied
- BpmnCopyPaste.js handles the copy-paste functionality and should trigger necessary updates
- LabelUtil.js contains core label handling utilities
- LabelLayoutUtil.js provides utilities for label layout calculations
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js handles property updates which may be needed when repositioning labels
