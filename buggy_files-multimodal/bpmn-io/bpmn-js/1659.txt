Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a shape (subprocess) is resized, its connected SequenceFlow is re-laid out
- However, the Labels and Associations attached to that SequenceFlow don't move with it, causing them to be disconnected from their intended positions

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the connection layout behavior and label/association positioning logic
- When a shape is resized, the SequenceFlow's waypoints are recalculated
- However, the system fails to update the positions of attached labels and associations relative to the new waypoints
- This suggests a missing or incorrect update in the label/association positioning behavior during connection layout changes

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LabelLayoutUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/ConnectionLayoutUtil.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- LabelBehavior.js handles the core label management and updates
- LayoutConnectionBehavior.js manages connection layout changes and should trigger updates to attached elements
- AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js handles dynamic label positioning
- LabelLayoutUtil.js and ConnectionLayoutUtil.js contain utility functions for calculating label and connection positions

The fix would likely involve modifying these files to ensure proper updating of label and association positions when connection waypoints change during shape resizing.
