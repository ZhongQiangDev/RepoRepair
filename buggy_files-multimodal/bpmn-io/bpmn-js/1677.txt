Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a user tries to delete an element while direct editing is active, an "illegal invocation" exception occurs
- The error happens specifically in the element.updateLabel action during execute/revert phase
- This causes the editor to crash instead of gracefully handling the deletion

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs because there's a conflict between the direct editing operation and element deletion
- When an element is being deleted while its label is being edited, the label update command tries to execute but fails because the element no longer exists
- This indicates a timing/sequencing issue in handling concurrent editing and deletion operations
- The error suggests the command stack is trying to execute a label update on an element that has already been removed

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lib/features/label-editing/cmd/UpdateLabelHandler.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/direct-editing/DirectEditingProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- UpdateLabelHandler.js handles the core label update operations that are failing
- LabelEditingProvider.js manages label editing behavior and interactions
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js handles property updates which includes label changes
- DirectEditingProvider.js manages the direct editing functionality that's active during the error
- Modeling.js coordinates modeling operations including element deletion and updates

The issue likely needs to be fixed by adding proper checks in UpdateLabelHandler.js to verify element existence before attempting updates, or by ensuring proper cleanup of direct editing operations before element deletion.
