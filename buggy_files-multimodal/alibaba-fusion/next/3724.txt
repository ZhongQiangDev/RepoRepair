Let me help analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue title and screenshot, the problem is that the Transfer component's searchProps cannot be separately controlled for the left and right search boxes. Currently, it appears the search functionality is applied uniformly to both sides.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the Transfer component's implementation where searchProps is likely being passed down as a single prop to both source and target panels, rather than allowing separate search configurations for each side. This limits the ability to customize search behavior independently for each panel.

3. Most Related Files:
Looking through the repository, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/transfer/view/transfer.jsx
src/transfer/view/transfer-panel.jsx
types/transfer/index.d.ts
docs/transfer/adaptor/index.jsx
docs/transfer/theme/index.jsx
```

Reasoning for selection:
- `transfer.jsx` is the main component file that handles the transfer logic and prop distribution
- `transfer-panel.jsx` contains the panel implementation where search is rendered
- `types/transfer/index.d.ts` defines the component's TypeScript interface and available props
- The adaptor and theme files show how the component is currently used and configured

The fix would likely need to start with modifying the main transfer component to accept separate search props for left and right panels, then update the panel implementation and type definitions accordingly.
