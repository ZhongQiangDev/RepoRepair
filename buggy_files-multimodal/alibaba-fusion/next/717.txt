Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `fillProps="name"` with an empty `dataSource` and a `defaultValue="jack"`, the Select component doesn't display the value "jack" as expected.
- The screenshot shows it should display "jack" but it's not showing anything.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how the Select component handles default values when there's no matching option in the dataSource.
- The `fillProps` prop is meant to specify which property from dataSource items should be used as the display value.
- When dataSource is empty but a defaultValue is provided, the component fails to properly display the defaultValue, suggesting an issue with the value display logic.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling Select component's value display:

```
src/select/select.jsx
src/select/option.jsx
src/select/index.jsx
types/select/index.d.ts
src/select/option-group.jsx
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `select.jsx` contains the core Select component logic and value handling
- `option.jsx` handles individual option rendering and value mapping
- `index.jsx` contains prop transformations and exports
- `index.d.ts` defines the component's type interfaces and props
- `option-group.jsx` handles option grouping which may affect value display

The fix would likely need to be implemented in `select.jsx` to properly handle displaying default values when dataSource is empty.
