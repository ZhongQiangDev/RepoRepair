Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and image, the problem is that the CascaderSelect component is modifying props that are passed into it, which causes errors when using immer (a library for immutable state management). This is against React's principle that props should be treated as immutable.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely stems from the CascaderSelect component directly modifying the props object it receives, rather than creating a new copy of the data before making modifications. This is particularly problematic when using immer, which expects immutable data handling.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx
src/cascader-select/index.jsx
src/cascader/cascader.jsx
src/cascader/index.jsx
types/cascader-select/index.d.ts
```

Reasoning:
- `src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx` is likely the main component implementation where the props modification is occurring
- `src/cascader-select/index.jsx` contains the entry point and prop transformations for the CascaderSelect component
- `src/cascader/cascader.jsx` is the base component that CascaderSelect builds upon
- `src/cascader/index.jsx` contains core functionality that might be affecting prop handling
- `types/cascader-select/index.d.ts` defines the TypeScript types and could help identify prop mutation patterns
