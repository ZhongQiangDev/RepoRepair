Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Select component's demo is displaying incorrectly with styling issues
- The styling appears to be too absolute, affecting other demos' layouts
- Based on the screenshots, there seems to be layout overflow and positioning problems

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to absolute positioning or styling in the Select component's demo code
- The demo's CSS is likely using absolute values that don't respect the container boundaries
- This suggests the styling in the demo files needs to be more relative/contained to prevent affecting other demos

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the Select demo styling issues:

```
docs/select/theme/index.jsx
docs/select/adaptor/index.jsx
src/select/index.jsx
src/demo-helper/index.jsx
src/util/dom.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `docs/select/theme/index.jsx` contains the actual demo implementation and styling
- `docs/select/adaptor/index.jsx` handles component configuration and props
- `src/select/index.jsx` contains the core Select component that may need style adjustments
- `src/demo-helper/index.jsx` manages demo layouts and could help contain the styles
- `src/util/dom.js` provides DOM utilities that might be needed for style calculations
