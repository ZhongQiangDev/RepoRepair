Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- In CascaderSelect with search enabled and multiple selection
- When all search results are selected
- The search results remain visible
- Users can't return to the full list without clicking outside to close and reopen

2. Cause Analysis:
- The search state (searchValue) is not being cleared automatically after selecting all matching items
- There's no built-in mechanism to clear search results or provide a clear button
- The component lacks UX consideration for this edge case where all filtered items are selected

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx
components/cascader-select/types.ts
components/cascader/cascader.tsx
components/search/Search.tsx
components/cascader/types.ts
```

The main fix would need to be in cascader-select.tsx since it handles the core search and selection logic. The types.ts files define the interfaces and types needed for the changes. The cascader.tsx contains the base cascader functionality that cascader-select builds upon. The Search.tsx component may need modifications to support clearing search results.
