Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue title "[Menu]Group/SubMenu空格识别为多个children 导致报错", the problem appears to be that spaces in Menu Group/SubMenu are being incorrectly recognized as multiple children, causing errors.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely stems from how the Menu component processes its children, particularly in group/submenu scenarios. When spaces are present in the menu structure, they're being interpreted as separate child elements rather than being properly handled as part of a single menu item or group. This suggests an issue with the child processing logic in the menu components.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/menu/view/group.jsx
src/menu/view/sub-menu.jsx
src/menu/view/menu.jsx
types/menu/index.d.ts
docs/menu/adaptor/index.jsx
```

Reasoning:
- `src/menu/view/group.jsx` is most critical as it directly handles menu group rendering and child processing
- `src/menu/view/sub-menu.jsx` is highly relevant as it manages submenu behavior and child elements
- `src/menu/view/menu.jsx` contains core menu logic that affects all menu components
- `types/menu/index.d.ts` defines the type structure that could influence how children are processed
- `docs/menu/adaptor/index.jsx` contains adaptor logic that might affect how menu items are processed

These files would need to be modified to properly handle spaces in menu group/submenu structures without treating them as separate children.
