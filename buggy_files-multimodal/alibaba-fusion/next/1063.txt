Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue "[Field]不能对传入的数据做改动" (Field cannot modify the input data), it appears that the Field component is modifying the input data when it shouldn't be.

2. Cause Analysis:
Looking at the linked file (src/field/index.js#L35) and the issue description, the Field component seems to be directly modifying the input data passed to it, rather than creating a copy or handling it immutably. This violates React's principle of immutable data handling and can cause unexpected side effects.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/field/index.js
src/field/utils.js
types/field/index.d.ts
src/form/index.jsx
src/form/field/index.jsx
```

These files are most relevant because:
- src/field/index.js is directly referenced in the issue and contains the core Field component logic
- src/field/utils.js contains utility functions for field data handling
- types/field/index.d.ts defines the TypeScript interfaces and types for the Field component
- src/form/index.jsx and src/form/field/index.jsx are related form components that interact with Field component

The fix would likely need to focus on ensuring immutable data handling in these files, particularly in src/field/index.js where the issue originates.
