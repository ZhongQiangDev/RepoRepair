Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking the "+" button in NumberPicker with defaultValue=4.02 and step=0.01, it shows 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03
- This occurs specifically in Safari browser

2. Cause Analysis:
- This is a JavaScript floating-point precision issue
- When performing arithmetic with decimal numbers (4.02 + 0.01), JavaScript's internal binary floating-point representation can lead to small rounding errors
- The issue is particularly noticeable in Safari's rendering of these calculations
- The NumberPicker component needs to handle this floating-point precision properly to display rounded values correctly

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/util/object.js
src/validate/rules/size.js
src/validate/rules/format.js
src/validate/rules/length.js
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
1. src/number-picker/index.jsx is the main component file where the number handling and display logic needs to be fixed
2. src/util/object.js contains utility functions that could be used to properly format/handle numeric values
3. The validation rule files (size.js, format.js, length.js) contain number handling logic that might need to be considered for consistent number formatting across the application

The fix would likely involve adding proper number rounding or precision handling in the NumberPicker component when processing step increments.
