Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using TreeSelect with both disabled items and default values, there are duplicate labels appearing in the input field
- A React warning is shown about duplicate keys: "Warning: Encountered two children with the same key"

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the handling of disabled items that are also part of the default selection
- When rendering selected items in the TreeSelect input field, the component is not properly deduplicating items or handling the combination of disabled + default selected states
- This suggests a problem in either the value normalization logic or the rendering of selected items in the TreeSelect component

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx
docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx
src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
types/tree-select/index.d.ts
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx` is the core component implementation where the duplicate key issue likely originates
- `docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx` handles the configuration and data transformation for TreeSelect, which could affect how disabled and default values are processed
- `src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx` and `tree.jsx` handle the underlying tree structure and node rendering
- `types/tree-select/index.d.ts` defines the component's interface and props, which includes handling of disabled items and default values
