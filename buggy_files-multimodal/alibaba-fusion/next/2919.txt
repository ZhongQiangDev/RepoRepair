Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The tab component doesn't support scrolling when the content is too long, making it difficult to access tabs that are out of view.

2. Cause Analysis:
Based on the screenshot and description, this appears to be a limitation in the tab navigation implementation where:
- The tab bar doesn't have proper overflow handling
- Keyboard scrolling support is missing
- The tab container likely has overflow set to hidden or doesn't properly handle overflow content
- The issue is specifically related to the tab navigation component rather than the tab content

3. Most Related Files:
Looking through the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx
src/tab/tab.jsx
src/tab/tabs/tab-item.jsx
docs/tab/adaptor/index.jsx
docs/tab/theme/index.jsx
```

Reasoning:
- `src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx` is most important as it directly handles tab navigation rendering and scroll behavior
- `src/tab/tab.jsx` contains the core Tab component implementation
- `src/tab/tabs/tab-item.jsx` handles individual tab items which affect overall layout
- `docs/tab/adaptor/index.jsx` contains configuration for tab behavior including overflow handling
- `docs/tab/theme/index.jsx` includes demo implementations that showcase tab functionality

The fix would likely need to start with modifications to the nav.jsx file to properly handle overflow scenarios and add keyboard scrolling support.
