Let me help analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Upload component's itemRender functionality is missing the delete/remove capability in version 1.22.0, as shown in the screenshot.

2. Cause Analysis:
Based on the repository information, this is likely due to missing or incorrect implementation of file removal functionality in the Upload component's item rendering logic. The core upload functionality is split across multiple components with List handling the file display and item actions.

3. Most Related Files:
The following files are most relevant to fixing the itemRender delete functionality, ordered by importance:

```
src/upload/list.jsx
src/upload/upload.jsx
src/upload/index.jsx
types/upload/index.d.ts
src/upload/card.jsx
```

Reasoning:
- `list.jsx` is most critical as it handles the rendering of uploaded files and their actions (including delete)
- `upload.jsx` contains the core Upload component logic and coordinates with List
- `index.jsx` is the main entry point that exposes the Upload component API
- `types/upload/index.d.ts` defines the TypeScript interfaces including itemRender props
- `card.jsx` implements card-style uploads which also uses itemRender functionality
