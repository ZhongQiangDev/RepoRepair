Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when using `useLabelForErrorMessage` API in Form component, the error message is not being displayed correctly when business layer adds additional DOM structure/styling.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that when custom DOM structures are added in the business layer, the Form component's error message display logic (which uses the label as the error message container) is not properly handling these additional DOM elements. This suggests the error message positioning and label reference logic needs to be more flexible to accommodate custom DOM structures.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/form/form.jsx
src/form/error.jsx
src/form/item.jsx
types/form/index.d.ts
src/form/enhance.jsx
```

These files are selected because:
- `form.jsx` contains the main Form component implementation including the `useLabelForErrorMessage` functionality
- `error.jsx` handles error message display logic
- `item.jsx` manages individual form items where labels and errors are rendered
- `index.d.ts` defines the type interfaces including error message related props
- `enhance.jsx` contains form enhancement utilities that might affect DOM structure handling
