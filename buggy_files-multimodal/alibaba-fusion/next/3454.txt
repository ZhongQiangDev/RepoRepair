Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue title "[NumberPicker]numberPicker最大值最小值变化没有实时检测到" (NumberPicker max and min values are not detected in real-time), the NumberPicker component is not properly updating when its max/min values change.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how the NumberPicker component handles prop changes for max/min values. The component likely needs to validate and update its current value when these bounds change to ensure the value stays within the new range. This would require proper prop comparison and value adjustment in lifecycle methods or hooks.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
src/number-picker/index.jsx
types/number-picker/index.d.ts
docs/number-picker/adaptor/index.jsx
src/field/index.js
```

Reasoning:
- `src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx` is the core implementation file that would handle value validation and updates
- `src/number-picker/index.jsx` is the main entry point that could affect how props are processed
- `types/number-picker/index.d.ts` defines the component's interface including max/min props
- `docs/number-picker/adaptor/index.jsx` contains demo/test implementations that could reveal usage patterns
- `src/field/index.js` handles form field states which might affect how number picker values are managed

The fix would likely need to be implemented in the core NumberPicker component to properly react to max/min prop changes.
