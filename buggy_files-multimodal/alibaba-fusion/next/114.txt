Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking the "+" button in NumberPicker with defaultValue 4.02 and step 0.01, it shows 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03
- This occurs specifically in Safari browser

2. Cause Analysis:
- This is a JavaScript floating-point precision issue
- When performing arithmetic with floating point numbers (4.02 + 0.01), JavaScript's internal binary representation can lead to small rounding errors
- The issue manifests in the NumberPicker component when it fails to properly round or format these floating point results before display

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/util/object.js
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/validate/rules/size.js
src/validate/rules/format.js
```

The `src/number-picker/index.jsx` is most critical as it contains the core NumberPicker component logic and would handle the value updates and display formatting. The utility files would be involved in number handling and validation but are less directly related to the specific issue.

The fix would likely involve adding proper rounding or number formatting logic in the NumberPicker component to handle floating-point arithmetic results before display.
