Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and image, the problem appears to be that when a Dialog has no title, the close button position is incorrect and overlaps with text content.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely stems from incorrect positioning or styling of the close button in the Dialog component when the title prop is empty or not provided. The close button's positioning logic may be dependent on the title's presence, and when the title is absent, the positioning calculations or CSS rules aren't handling this case properly.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/dialog/inner.jsx
src/dialog/dialog.jsx
src/dialog/index.jsx
docs/dialog/theme/index.jsx
docs/dialog/adaptor/index.jsx
```

Reasoning:
- `src/dialog/inner.jsx` is most important as it handles the internal structure and rendering of the Dialog component, including the close button positioning
- `src/dialog/dialog.jsx` contains the core Dialog component logic and layout management
- `src/dialog/index.jsx` provides the main entry point and configuration for the Dialog component
- `docs/dialog/theme/index.jsx` contains theme-related styling that could affect button positioning
- `docs/dialog/adaptor/index.jsx` handles Dialog adaptations and property transformations that might influence layout
