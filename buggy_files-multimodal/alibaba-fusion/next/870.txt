Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Overlay component shows incorrect positioning when there are two scrollbars present. Specifically, when clicking a datepicker while scrolling down (with datepicker still in viewport), the datepicker popup appears in the wrong position.

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be an issue with the Overlay component's position calculation not properly accounting for multiple scrollbars. When calculating the position for the popup, it likely only considers one scrollbar or doesn't properly handle nested scrollable containers, leading to incorrect offset calculations.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/overlay/overlay.jsx
src/overlay/position.jsx
src/overlay/utils/position.js
src/overlay/manager.js
src/date-picker/date-picker.jsx
```

Reasoning:
- `src/overlay/overlay.jsx` is the main component handling overlay positioning and visibility
- `src/overlay/position.jsx` contains the core positioning logic
- `src/overlay/utils/position.js` has utilities for calculating positions and offsets
- `src/overlay/manager.js` manages overlay instances and their states
- `src/date-picker/date-picker.jsx` is the component using the overlay for its popup

The issue likely needs to be fixed in the positioning calculation logic within these files, particularly in how they handle multiple scrollable containers and their respective offsets.
