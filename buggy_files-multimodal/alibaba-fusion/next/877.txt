Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The overlay content collapses when the content is inline
- This appears to be a layout issue where the overlay container doesn't maintain proper width

2. Cause Analysis:
- Based on the screenshot and description, the issue occurs when content is inline and there's insufficient space for the browser to render
- The solution mentioned is to add `width: 100%`, suggesting the overlay container isn't properly maintaining its width when containing inline content
- This is likely a CSS layout issue in the overlay component where the container doesn't establish a proper containing block for inline content

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files would be those handling overlay positioning and layout. From the repository information:

```
src/overlay/overlay.jsx
src/overlay/popup.jsx
src/balloon/balloon.jsx
src/balloon/inner.jsx
src/overlay/position.jsx
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- overlay.jsx contains core overlay rendering and positioning logic
- popup.jsx handles popup-specific overlay behaviors
- balloon.jsx and inner.jsx implement the balloon/tooltip functionality that uses overlays
- position.jsx contains positioning utilities that affect overlay layout

The fix would likely need to be implemented in these files to ensure proper width handling for inline content in overlays.
