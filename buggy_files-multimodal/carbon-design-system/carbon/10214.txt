Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `TableHeader` component is not properly spreading `...rest` props on the `th` element for sortable columns
- Specifically, when `id` prop is passed, it only gets set on non-sortable columns but not on sortable ones
- For sortable columns, the `...rest` props are incorrectly spread on the inner button element instead of the `th`

2. Cause Analysis:
- In the `TableHeader` component, there are two rendering paths:
  - For non-sortable columns: `...rest` is correctly spread on the `th` element
  - For sortable columns: `...rest` is incorrectly spread on the inner button element instead of the `th`
- This appears to be a bug in the component's implementation where props are being spread at the wrong level of the DOM hierarchy

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
```

The `TableHeader.js` file is the most important as it contains the actual bug in the prop spreading logic. `DataTable.js` and `Table.js` are related as they are the parent components that pass props down to `TableHeader` and provide the context for how the header should behave (sortable vs non-sortable).
