Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The breadcrumb overflow menu's shark fin (dropdown arrow) is positioned incorrectly
- The overflow menu's position is wrong
- This is a regression from previous correct behavior

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from `displayName` not being set in the code after introducing `createComponentToggle`
- The `createComponentToggle` function is used to toggle between component versions, but it's not properly maintaining the displayName property
- This affects the positioning calculations for the overflow menu and its shark fin indicator
- The positioning logic relies on proper component identification via displayName

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js
packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/BreadcrumbItem.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/Breadcrumb.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- ComponentToggle.js is the root cause as it's not properly handling displayName
- BreadcrumbItem.js contains the overflow menu integration with breadcrumbs
- OverflowMenu.js handles the menu positioning and shark fin
- FloatingMenu.js provides core positioning logic for floating elements
- Breadcrumb.js is the parent component affected by this issue
