Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The pagination footer shows plural forms ("items" and "pages") even when there is only one item or one page
- This creates grammatically incorrect messages like "1 items" instead of "1 item"

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from hardcoded plural forms in the text strings used for pagination
- The text generation doesn't check if the count equals 1 to use singular form
- Based on the GitHub issue reference, this occurs in the Pagination.js component where item/page counts are displayed

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/PageSelector.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-test.js
```

The main file `Pagination.js` contains the core logic for rendering pagination text. The experimental version and related files (story, selector, test) also handle pagination display but are secondary. The issue needs to be fixed primarily in the main Pagination component where the text strings are constructed and rendered.
