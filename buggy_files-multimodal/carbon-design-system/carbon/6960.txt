Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A long single line of text (CRN) in a codesnippet component does not wrap to multiple lines
- Setting type="multi" and height does not help with text wrapping
- The text overflows horizontally instead of wrapping

2. Cause Analysis:
- The CodeSnippet component lacks text wrapping functionality for long single lines
- The component's CSS likely doesn't have proper wrapping properties like `white-space: pre-wrap` or `word-break: break-all`
- The type="multi" prop appears to control the display mode but doesn't affect text wrapping behavior

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-story.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.Skeleton.js
packages/components/demo/js/components/CodeExample/CodeExample.js
packages/components/demo/js/data-table-demo-expand-all-manager.js
```

The main CodeSnippet.js file contains the core component implementation where text wrapping behavior needs to be added. The story and example files show how the component is used and tested. The skeleton file may need updates to match any styling changes. The data-table manager shows an example of handling expanded content which could be relevant for implementing the wrapping behavior.
