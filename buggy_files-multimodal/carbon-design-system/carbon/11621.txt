Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The search icon in the DataTable selection variant is misaligned
- The icon appears off-center or displaced when hovering over it
- This is a visual styling issue affecting the search button's appearance

2. Cause Analysis:
- Based on the screenshots and description, this appears to be a CSS styling issue specifically related to the search icon positioning within the DataTable component
- The issue manifests during hover state, suggesting hover-specific styles may be incorrectly defined
- The problem likely stems from either incorrect positioning styles or conflicting class names in the search-related components within the DataTable

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository files, these are most likely to be involved in the issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.js
packages/react/src/components/SearchFilterButton/SearchFilterButton.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarSearch.js
packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.Skeleton.js
```

Reasoning:
- DataTable.js is the main component where the search functionality is integrated
- Search.js contains the core search component implementation and styling
- SearchFilterButton.js handles the button that contains the misaligned icon
- TableToolbarSearch.js specifically deals with search in table toolbars
- Search.Skeleton.js may contain shared styling that affects the search component

These files are ordered by their likelihood of containing the root cause, with DataTable.js and Search.js being the most probable locations for the styling issue.
