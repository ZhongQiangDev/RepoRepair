Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The DatePicker component crashes when `datePickerType="single"` is set
- The error occurs specifically with: `TypeError: start.addEventListener is not a function`
- This suggests that the `start` variable is undefined when the code tries to add an event listener

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs in DatePicker.js line 316
- The crash happens when trying to add a keydown event listener for arrow key handling
- This indicates that the component is trying to access DOM elements or refs before they are properly initialized
- The issue started after Carbon 11 migration, suggesting a breaking change in how refs or DOM elements are handled

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker-test.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker-story.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePickerInput/DatePickerInput.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/fixEventsPlugin.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- DatePicker.js is the main component where the error occurs
- DatePicker-test.js would contain test cases that should catch this type of error
- DatePicker-story.js contains example usage and could help verify the issue
- DatePickerInput.js is a child component that might affect ref handling
- fixEventsPlugin.js handles event listeners which is directly related to the error
