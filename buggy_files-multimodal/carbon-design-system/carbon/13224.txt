Let me analyze this:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The issue involves a combo button in the local navigation that takes up too much space when displaying all three actions by default
- The solution is to use a contextual/combo menu to contain these actions to save space

2. Cause Analysis:
- The current implementation shows all action buttons directly in the navigation bar
- This causes space issues since each button takes up horizontal space
- A combo button pattern would consolidate multiple actions into a single button with a dropdown menu
- This requires components that handle button groups, dropdowns, and menu items

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to implementing a combo button solution:

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuV2/index.js
packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js
packages/react/src/components/Menu/MenuItem.js
packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- OverflowMenu.js provides the core functionality for dropdown menus
- OverflowMenuV2/index.js offers an updated version with improved features
- Menu.js handles the menu container and positioning
- MenuItem.js manages individual menu items
- FloatingMenu.js handles positioning and rendering of floating menus

These components together would allow implementing a combo button that consolidates multiple actions into a space-efficient dropdown menu.
