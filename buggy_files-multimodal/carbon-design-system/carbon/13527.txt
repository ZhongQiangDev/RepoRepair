Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When hovering over the sidenav, a dropdown menu opens
- When moving the mouse away, the sidenav retracts but the dropdown menu stays open
- This creates a visually inconsistent state where the dropdown appears disconnected from its parent menu

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be with state management between the sidenav and its dropdown menus
- When the sidenav retracts, it's not properly closing/cleaning up its child dropdown menus
- This suggests a missing connection between the parent sidenav's expanded state and the dropdown menu's visibility
- The issue is likely in the UIShell components, specifically in the sidenav and menu-related components

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- SideNav.js is the main component handling the expansion/retraction behavior
- SideNavMenu.js manages the dropdown menu state within the sidenav
- HeaderMenu.js contains related menu functionality that may affect dropdown behavior
- FloatingMenu.js handles positioning and visibility of floating menus
- OverflowMenu.js provides base menu functionality that might influence dropdown behavior

The fix would likely involve modifying SideNav.js and SideNavMenu.js to ensure dropdown menus are closed when the sidenav retracts.
