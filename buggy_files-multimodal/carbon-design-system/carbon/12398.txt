Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and screenshots, the problem is that checkbox inputs need to implement a read-only state, which is currently missing. The read-only state should be controlled by a prop and have appropriate styling.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue requires implementing a read-only prop and associated styles for checkbox inputs. This would need:
- Adding a read-only prop to the checkbox component
- Implementing styles for the read-only state
- Adding controls for testing different states
- Including RTL tests for the read-only class
- Creating a default story for demonstration

3. Most Related Files:
Looking through the repository files, these are the most relevant for implementing the read-only checkbox functionality:

```
packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx
packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Form/Form.js
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. Checkbox.tsx is the main component that needs the read-only prop implementation
2. Checkbox.stories.js needs new stories for demonstrating read-only state
3. Checkbox-test.js needs RTL tests for the read-only class
4. Form.js and FormGroup.js may need updates to properly handle read-only form controls
