Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using shift+click for multi-selection of tiles, if a previously selected tile is clicked again while holding shift, it becomes deselected even though the `selected` prop indicates it should remain selected.
- This is demonstrated in the GIF where clicking the fourth tile while holding shift deselects it instead of maintaining its selected state.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the tile's click handler not respecting the `selected` prop value when handling shift+click events.
- Looking at the referenced code paths in the GitHub issue:
  - The click handler in Tile.js is toggling the selection state without considering the `selected` prop value
  - This causes the tile to toggle its state independently rather than respecting the desired selection state passed through props

3. Most Related Files:
The key files involved in this selection behavior would be:

```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js
packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-test.js
packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectRow.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `Tile.js` contains the core tile component and selection handling logic where the bug originates
2. `Selection.js` manages the selection state and behavior that should be respected
3. `Tile-test.js` contains tests that should verify correct selection behavior
4. `TileGroup.js` manages groups of tiles and their selection states
5. `TableSelectRow.js` implements similar selection logic that could be referenced for correct behavior
