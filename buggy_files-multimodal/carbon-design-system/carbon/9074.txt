Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components do not allow setting a custom `id` for their `legend` elements
- The `aria-labelledby` attribute of the `fieldset` cannot be properly linked to the legend's `id`
- This prevents proper screen reader functionality in IBM Cloud UI's settings dropdown menu sections

2. Cause Analysis:
- The components lack props to pass custom IDs to their `legend` elements
- The `fieldset` and `legend` elements are not properly connected via ARIA attributes
- While props can be passed to the `fieldset` in `FormGroup`, there's no way to customize the `legend` attributes
- For `RadioButtonGroup`, neither `fieldset` nor `legend` attributes can be customized

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButtonGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/Form/Form.js
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup-story.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton-story.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `FormGroup.js` is the main component that needs modification to support custom legend IDs
2. `RadioButtonGroup.js` also needs similar modifications for legend ID support
3. `Form.js` is the parent component that may need adjustments to properly handle these new props
4. The story files will need updates to demonstrate and test the new functionality
