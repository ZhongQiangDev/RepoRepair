I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issues with the RadioTile validation.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
From the GitHub problem description, there are two main issues with the `RadioTile` component's native form validation:

1. The `required` attribute has to be specified on every `RadioTile` instead of just once on the `TileGroup`
2. The invisible underlying input is not positioned correctly to display validation errors at a suitable location

## Analyzing the Cause
1. For the first issue: In traditional radio button groups, only one `required` attribute is needed on the parent level. Here, the implementation is forcing developers to add `required` to each individual `RadioTile`.

2. For the second issue: The CSS positioning of the hidden input element is not optimal for displaying validation messages. As shown in the screenshots, the validation popup appears in an awkward position. The suggested fix involves positioning the input at the bottom middle of the tile or group.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information and the problem description, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioTile/RadioTile.tsx
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-test.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup-test.js
packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx
```

The `RadioTile.tsx` and `TileGroup.tsx` files would contain the actual component implementations that need to be modified to fix the issues. The test files are important for understanding the current behavior and ensuring that any changes maintain compatibility with existing tests. The RadioButtonGroup test file is relevant because TileGroup likely shares similar group validation patterns.
