Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The React `<ComboBox>` selection element is showing incorrect styles that make it appear broken
- Specifically, it's including multiselect styles when it shouldn't
- The invalid state selection icon is positioned incorrectly

2. Cause Analysis:
- Based on the screenshots and description, this appears to be a styling issue where the ComboBox component is inheriting or being applied styles meant for multiselect components
- The invalid state icon positioning suggests there's a CSS conflict or incorrect style application for validation states
- The core issue likely lies in the ComboBox component implementation and its related styling files

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxField.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- ComboBox.js is the main component file where the issue is occurring
- ListBox.js provides the base implementation that ComboBox extends
- ListBoxField.js handles the input field styling and structure
- ListBoxMenuItem.js manages individual menu item styling
- ListBoxSelection.js handles selection states and related styling

These files together control the styling and behavior of the ComboBox component and its selection states, making them the most likely sources of the styling issues described.
