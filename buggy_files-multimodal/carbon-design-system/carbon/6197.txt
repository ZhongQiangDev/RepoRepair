Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The alignment of labels in 'tall' data table headers is misaligned when sorting is enabled
- From the screenshot, we can see that only the first column (which is sortable) has different vertical alignment compared to other non-sortable columns in the header

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears when:
  - The DataTable size prop is set to 'tall'
  - Some columns are sortable while others are not
- This suggests the CSS styling for sortable vs non-sortable headers is inconsistent when using the 'tall' size variant
- The core issue likely lies in the header component styling and how it handles different sizes combined with sorting functionality

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
packages/components/src/components/data-table/data-table.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
packages/components/src/components/data-table/data-table.config.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- TableHeader.js is directly responsible for rendering table headers and handling sort functionality
- DataTable.js and Table.js contain the core table components and size prop handling
- data-table.js contains the base styling and functionality
- data-table.config.js may contain configuration affecting sortable columns

The issue is likely a CSS styling inconsistency in TableHeader.js when handling both 'tall' size and sortable states.
