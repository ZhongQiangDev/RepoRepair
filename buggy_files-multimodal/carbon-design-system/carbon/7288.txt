Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The multiselect dropdown immediately disables rows when nothing is selected, and the dropdown closes
- This creates a poor user experience as users can't see their selection changes before the dropdown closes
- The desired behavior is to keep the dropdown open while making selections, only applying changes when the menu is manually closed

2. Cause Analysis:
- The current implementation only has an `onChange` event that triggers immediately when selections change
- There is no separate event to handle when the menu visibility changes (opens/closes)
- This causes row disabling to happen on every selection change rather than waiting for the menu to close
- Need to add an `onMenuChange` event to handle visibility changes separately from selection changes

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- MultiSelect.js is the main component that needs the new onMenuChange event
- FilterableMultiSelect.js extends MultiSelect functionality and would need similar changes
- ListBoxSelection.js handles selection UI/state that interacts with menu visibility
- Dropdown.js contains similar menu visibility logic that could be referenced
- Selection.js manages the underlying selection state that triggers changes
