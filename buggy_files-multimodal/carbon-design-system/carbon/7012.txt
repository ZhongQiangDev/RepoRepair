Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The button component lacks `xl` (80px height) and `large` (64px height) size variants
- This makes smaller buttons at the bottom right of pages easily overlooked
- The button sizes are not proportional to how buttons are treated elsewhere (like in modals)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Button component's size variants are limited and don't include larger options needed for better visibility and consistency
- The current implementation doesn't support the required 80px and 64px height variants
- This is primarily a feature gap in the Button component's size options

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
packages/components/src/components/button/button.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js
packages/components/src/components/button/button.config.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `Button.js` (React): The main React Button component implementation where size variants need to be added
2. `Button-story.js`: Contains the documentation and examples for Button sizes, which needs updating
3. `button.js` (Components): The core button component implementation that may need size-related updates
4. `Button-test.js`: Test file that needs to be updated to cover new size variants
5. `button.config.js`: Configuration file that may contain button size definitions

These files would need to be modified to implement the new `xl` and `large` size variants for the button component.
