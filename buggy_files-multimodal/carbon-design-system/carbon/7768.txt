Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- VoiceOver reads dropdown items twice when navigating through them using keyboard
- This happens specifically when using Mac VoiceOver (Command F5) to navigate through dropdown menu items

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to ARIA attributes and accessibility handling in the dropdown component
- The duplicate reading suggests there may be:
  - Multiple ARIA labels/descriptions for the same item
  - Redundant accessibility attributes
  - Multiple elements representing the same content
- The issue is specific to dropdown menu items and their accessibility implementation

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files dealing with dropdown accessibility and menu items are:

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js
packages/components/src/components/dropdown/dropdown.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `Dropdown.js` (React) is the main component handling dropdown functionality and accessibility
2. `ListBoxMenuItem.js` handles individual menu items and their ARIA attributes
3. `ListBoxMenu.js` manages the menu container and its accessibility context
4. `dropdown.js` (components) provides core dropdown functionality
5. `ComboBox.js` shares similar dropdown menu functionality and accessibility features

These files would need to be examined and potentially modified to fix the duplicate VoiceOver reading issue by ensuring proper ARIA attribute implementation and preventing redundant accessibility labels.
