Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The small ghost button is 36px in height
- It should be 32px tall according to the design specification
- This is a styling/CSS issue affecting the button's vertical dimensions

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a CSS height definition issue for the small variant of ghost buttons
- The problem likely lies in the button component's SCSS/CSS files where height values are defined
- The ghost button variant is inheriting or being explicitly set to an incorrect height value of 36px instead of 32px

3. Most Related Files:
Looking through the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the button height issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js
```

These files are most important because:
- `Button.js` is the core component file that defines the button's structure and styling props
- `Button-story.js` contains the visual documentation and examples of different button variants
- `Button-test.js` contains tests that verify button dimensions and styling

The ghost button height issue would need to be fixed in these files, particularly in the core Button component where size variants are defined. The story and test files would need to be updated to reflect and verify the correct 32px height for small ghost buttons.
