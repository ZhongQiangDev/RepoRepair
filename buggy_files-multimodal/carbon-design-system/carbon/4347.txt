Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Overflow Menu component lacks a light theme variant
- The gray menu appears on gray background which creates poor contrast/visibility
- Other components like Text Input have a `--light` modifier but Overflow Menu doesn't have this feature

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Overflow Menu component needs styling support for a light theme variant
- The component's CSS/SCSS needs to be updated to include light theme styles similar to other components
- The component's React implementation needs to accept and handle a `light` prop to toggle the light theme

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-story.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-test.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
packages/themes/examples/preview/index.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- OverflowMenu.js is the main component implementation where light theme support needs to be added
- OverflowMenu-story.js contains the component's stories/examples where light theme demos would be shown
- OverflowMenu-test.js needs updates to test light theme functionality
- OverflowMenuItem.js may need light theme styling for menu items
- themes/preview/index.js handles theme switching and would need to support light theme for OverflowMenu
