Let me help analyze this issue:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Missing inverse tokens (`$link-inverse-active` and `$link-inverse-hover`) needed for high contrast scenarios like tooltips, popovers, and notifications
- These tokens are meant to pair with existing `$link-inverse` token for consistent styling

2. Cause Analysis:
- The theme system needs new token definitions for inverse link states (active and hover)
- These tokens need to be defined across different color themes (White, Gray 10, Gray 90, Gray 100)
- The tokens need to be integrated into the existing theming system and made available through SCSS/CSS

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
packages/themes/tasks/build.js
packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js
packages/themes/src/next/tokens/Token.js
packages/themes/src/tools.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `tokens.js` - Core file for token definitions and processing
2. `build.js` - Orchestrates the token build process and SCSS generation
3. `tokens.js` (in builders) - Handles token generation and formatting for SCSS output
4. `Token.js` - Base token class definition for creating new tokens
5. `tools.js` - Contains utilities for token manipulation and color processing

These files would need to be modified to add and properly integrate the new inverse link tokens into the theming system.
