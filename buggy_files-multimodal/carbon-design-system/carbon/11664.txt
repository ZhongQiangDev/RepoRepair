Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The OverflowMenu component shows a deprecation warning about the `light` prop being deprecated, even though the `light` prop is not being used in the code.
- The warning states: "The `light` prop for `OverflowMenu` is no longer needed and has been deprecated. It will be removed in the next major release. Use the Layer component instead."

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with the deprecation warning logic in the OverflowMenu component.
- The warning is likely being triggered unconditionally rather than only when the `light` prop is actually used.
- Based on the repository files, this is probably related to how prop deprecation warnings are handled in the codebase.

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/deprecate.js
packages/react/src/internal/deprecateFieldOnObject.js
packages/react/src/internal/warning.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
1. `OverflowMenu.js` is the main component file where the deprecation warning is being triggered
2. `deprecate.js` contains the core deprecation warning logic for props
3. `deprecateFieldOnObject.js` handles object field deprecation warnings
4. `warning.js` contains the base warning utility function
5. `createChainableTypeChecker.js` helps create prop type validators that may be involved in the deprecation warning system

These files together form the deprecation warning system that's causing the unintended warning behavior.
