Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- React throws exceptions due to duplicated key errors in ComboBox component
- This occurs when there are menu options with the same text content
- The issue happens because `itemToString` is being used as both the MenuItem key and for menu option display

2. Cause Analysis:
- The ComboBox component is using the text content from `itemToString` as the key for MenuItems
- When multiple options have the same text, this creates duplicate keys which violates React's requirement for unique keys
- The component should use unique IDs for keys instead of potentially duplicate text content
- The fix would involve modifying how keys are assigned to MenuItems, prioritizing unique IDs over display text

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-test.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-story.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. ComboBox.js is the main component where the key assignment needs to be fixed
2. ListBoxMenuItem.js handles the individual menu items where keys are used
3. ListBox.js is the parent component managing the menu structure
4. ComboBox-test.js would need updates to test the new key behavior
5. ComboBox-story.js contains examples that demonstrate the component usage
