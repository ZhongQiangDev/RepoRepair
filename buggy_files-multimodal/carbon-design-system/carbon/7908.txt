Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A button is rendered inside another button in a multiselect component when users select items
- This creates nested interactive elements which violates HTML5 spec 4.10.6
- The nested structure causes accessibility issues for screen readers and keyboard users

2. Cause Analysis:
- The multiselect component is incorrectly implementing the clear selection functionality by nesting a button inside another button
- This violates the HTML5 specification which states buttons must not contain interactive content descendants
- The implementation needs to be restructured to avoid nesting interactive elements while maintaining the clear selection functionality

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js
packages/components/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect-story.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- MultiSelect.js and FilterableMultiSelect.js contain the core multiselect component implementation
- ListBoxSelection.js files handle the selection UI and clear functionality where the nested button issue likely exists
- MultiSelect-story.js shows usage examples that could help understand the intended behavior

The fix would likely involve restructuring the clear selection button implementation in these files to avoid nesting interactive elements while maintaining the same functionality.
