Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `FormGroup` component only accepts string values for its `legendText` prop
- When trying to use a `Tooltip` component within `legendText`, it throws a prop type warning because an object is being passed instead of a string

2. Cause Analysis:
- The `FormGroup` component's prop type validation is too restrictive, only allowing strings for `legendText`
- This prevents using React components like `Tooltip` within the `legendText`, limiting accessibility and help text functionality
- Similar components like `TextInput` already support this functionality through their `labelText` prop, suggesting inconsistency in the implementation

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/childrenOfType.js
```

The `FormGroup.js` is the primary file needing modification as it contains the prop type definition and rendering logic. The test file needs updating to support the new prop type. The `Tooltip.js` and `TextInput.js` files serve as references for how similar functionality is implemented elsewhere in the codebase. The `childrenOfType.js` utility could be useful for implementing proper type checking for React elements.
