Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The CodeSnippet component lacks a disabled state/attribute
- When disabled, the CodeSnippet still allows keyboard focus
- The copy functionality remains active even when the component should be disabled
- There's no visual indication that the CodeSnippet is in a disabled state

2. Cause Analysis:
- The CodeSnippet component doesn't have built-in support for a disabled state
- The keyboard focus management isn't properly handling disabled states
- The copy button functionality isn't respecting a disabled state
- The component's styling doesn't account for disabled visual states
- The accessibility features don't properly handle disabled states

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
packages/react/src/components/Copy/Copy.js
packages/react/src/components/CopyButton/CopyButton.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Copy/Copy-test.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. CodeSnippet.js is the main component that needs the disabled state implementation
2. Copy.js contains the core copy functionality that needs to respect disabled state
3. CopyButton.js implements the copy button that needs disabled state handling
4. CodeSnippet-story.js would need updates to demonstrate the new disabled functionality
5. Copy-test.js would need new test cases for disabled state behavior
