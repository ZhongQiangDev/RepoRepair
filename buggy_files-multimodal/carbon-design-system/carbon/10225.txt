Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Tabs component currently lacks an icon-only variant
- Both Line Tabs and ContainedTabs need to support displaying just icons without text labels

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Tabs components need to be modified to support a new display mode where only icons are shown
- This requires changes to both the base Tab components and their container components
- The styling and layout need to be adjusted to properly center and display icons without text
- Accessibility considerations need to be maintained when removing visible text labels

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/ContainedTabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/next/ContainedTab.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/next/Tab.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/Tabs.stories.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- ContainedTabs.js and Tabs.js contain the main tab container components that need to be modified
- ContainedTab.js and Tab.js handle individual tab rendering and need updates for icon-only display
- Tabs.stories.js will need updates to demonstrate the new icon-only variants in documentation

The changes would primarily involve adding new props to control icon-only display and updating the rendering logic and styles accordingly.
