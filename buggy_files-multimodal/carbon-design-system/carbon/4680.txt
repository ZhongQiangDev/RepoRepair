Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components in the UIShell are showing up as "Anonymous" in the React browser plugin
- This indicates missing displayName properties for these forwardRef components

2. Cause Analysis:
- When using React.forwardRef(), the resulting component doesn't automatically get a displayName
- The components are being wrapped with forwardRef but not having their displayName explicitly set
- This makes debugging more difficult since the components show as "Anonymous" in React DevTools

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/getDisplayName.js
packages/react/src/tools/wrapComponent.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/UIShell-story.js
```

The files are ordered by importance because:

1. HeaderMenu.js - One of the main components showing the issue, contains the forwardRef implementation
2. SideNavMenu.js - The other main component showing the issue, also contains forwardRef implementation
3. getDisplayName.js - Utility for handling component display names, could be used to fix the issue
4. wrapComponent.js - Contains component wrapping logic that handles displayName
5. UIShell-story.js - Contains usage examples and documentation of these components

These files would need to be modified to properly set displayName on the forwardRef components to fix the "Anonymous" issue in React DevTools.
