Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The fluid text input component is missing a skeleton loading state that was originally specified but left out.
- This affects the visual feedback during loading states for fluid text inputs.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The skeleton state implementation was overlooked during the initial development of fluid text inputs
- This requires adding skeleton styling and component logic specific to fluid text inputs
- The implementation would need to integrate with existing text input skeleton patterns while maintaining fluid behavior

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/FluidTextInput/FluidTextInput.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/FluidForm/FluidForm.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/next/TextInput.stories.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- FluidTextInput.stories.js: Main component that needs the skeleton state added
- TextInput.Skeleton.js: Contains existing skeleton implementation to reference/extend
- FluidForm.js: Parent component that manages fluid context
- TextInput.js: Base text input implementation that fluid version builds upon
- TextInput.stories.js: Contains examples of skeleton states in regular text inputs

The fix would likely involve adding a new skeleton component specifically for fluid text inputs while leveraging the existing skeleton patterns from the regular text input component.
