Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The table cell with checkbox in DataTable's TableSelectRow has a height of 52px instead of the expected 48px
- The class `bx--table-column-checkbox` is missing from the checkbox cell in React implementation, while it exists in the carbondesignsystem page

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from missing CSS class `bx--table-column-checkbox` on the `<td>` element containing the checkbox in TableSelectRow component
- This class is responsible for setting the correct height (48px) for checkbox cells
- The React implementation is not applying this class properly, leading to incorrect cell height

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectRow.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBody.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableCell.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. TableSelectRow.js is directly responsible for rendering the checkbox cell and applying its classes
2. DataTable.js is the main component that orchestrates the table structure and behavior
3. Table.js handles the base table styling and structure
4. TableBody.js manages the table body where the select rows are rendered
5. TableCell.js provides the base cell implementation that TableSelectRow likely extends

The fix would likely involve modifying TableSelectRow.js to properly apply the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class to the checkbox cell.
