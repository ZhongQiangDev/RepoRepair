Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `SelectableTile` component's `onChange` event is not being fired when clicking or using keyboard interaction
- Only `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` events are firing
- According to documentation, `onChange` should fire when the tile's state changes

2. Cause Analysis:
- Looking at the repository information, the issue appears to be in the Tile component implementation
- The `SelectableTile` extends functionality from the base Tile component
- While click and keyboard handlers are properly set up, they're not propagating to trigger the `onChange` event
- The component is likely missing the onChange event emission in its state change handlers

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/components/src/components/tile/tile.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-story.js
packages/components/src/components/removed-component.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. The base tile.js contains the core implementation where the event handling issue likely exists
2. The React-specific Tile implementation would handle the React event binding
3. The test file would verify event handling behavior
4. The story file demonstrates expected usage and behavior
5. The removed-component.js helps verify if any functionality was accidentally removed

The fix would likely involve modifying the event handlers in the base tile implementation to properly emit onChange events when the tile's state changes.
