Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The UIShell storybook component API prop tables are not rendering properly, as shown in the screenshot. This suggests an issue with the documentation/prop table generation system in the storybook configuration.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how the UIShell components' props are being documented and rendered in Storybook. Since this involves API documentation tables not displaying correctly, it's likely related to:
- Storybook configuration files
- UIShell component documentation
- Story files that define the component documentation
- React component prop definitions

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/UIShell.stories.js
packages/react/.storybook/preview.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/Header.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderGlobalAction.js
```

These files are selected because:
- UIShell.stories.js is the main story file where component documentation is defined
- preview.js contains Storybook configuration that affects how documentation is rendered
- The Header.js, HeaderContainer.js, and HeaderGlobalAction.js files contain the actual component definitions and prop types that feed into the documentation

The issue likely requires updates to how props are defined or documented in these files to ensure proper rendering in the Storybook prop tables.
