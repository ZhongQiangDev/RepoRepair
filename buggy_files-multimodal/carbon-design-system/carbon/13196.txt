Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `hideLabel` prop in Toggle component doesn't actually hide the label when set to `true`
- Instead, it only changes the label position from top to side
- The label only gets hidden when both `hideLabel={true}` AND `aria-labelledby` are set properly
- This behavior is not well documented and is unintuitive

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Toggle component seems to have a tight coupling between the `hideLabel` prop and `aria-labelledby` attribute
- The component likely requires `aria-labelledby` to ensure accessibility even when the label is visually hidden
- However, this requirement prevents the component from working with alternative accessibility approaches like using the `for` attribute on labels
- The documentation doesn't clearly explain this dependency

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/internal/useNoInteractiveChildren.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. Toggle.js contains the core component implementation where the `hideLabel` behavior is defined
2. Toggle.stories.js would contain the documentation and examples that need to be updated
3. Toggle-test.js would need updates to test the modified behavior
4. Toggle.Skeleton.js might need updates if the label hiding behavior affects the skeleton state
5. useNoInteractiveChildren.js could be relevant for accessibility checks when hiding labels
