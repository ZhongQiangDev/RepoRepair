Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and screenshots, the problem appears to be related to read-only inputs in a Combobox component. The issue suggests implementing a read-only state for the Combobox, which currently doesn't have this functionality.

2. Cause Analysis:
The Combobox component needs to:
- Add a read-only prop
- Add styles for the read-only state
- Implement proper behavior when in read-only mode
- Include RTL tests for the read-only functionality
- Add playground controls for testing the read-only state

3. Most Related Files:
Looking through the repository files, these are the most relevant for implementing read-only functionality in the Combobox component:

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-test.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
packages/react/src/components/FormContext/index.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. ComboBox.js is the main component that needs modification to add read-only support
2. ComboBox-test.js needs new tests for read-only functionality
3. ComboBox.stories.js needs new stories to demonstrate read-only state
4. TextInput.js provides reference for read-only implementation in a similar component
5. FormContext/index.js may be needed for form-level read-only state management
