Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The multi-select implementation needs to support read-only inputs
- Currently there's no prop or styling for read-only state in the multi-select component

2. Cause Analysis:
- The multi-select component lacks a read-only prop implementation
- Missing styles for read-only state
- No RTL tests for validating read-only functionality
- The component needs to be updated in the /package/react directory

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/FluidMultiSelect/FluidMultiSelect.js
packages/react/src/components/FluidMultiSelect/FluidMultiSelect.stories.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. MultiSelect.js is the main component that needs the read-only implementation
2. FilterableMultiSelect.js extends MultiSelect functionality and would need read-only support
3. MultiSelect.stories.js needs to be updated to showcase read-only state
4. FluidMultiSelect.js is a variant that would inherit read-only behavior
5. FluidMultiSelect.stories.js would need examples of read-only state in fluid context
