Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The toggle implementation lacks a read-only state functionality
- When a toggle is read-only, it should still be readable by screenreaders but not allow value changes
- Currently there's no way to make a toggle read-only without disabling it completely

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Toggle component needs to be enhanced to support a read-only state that:
  - Maintains accessibility (can be read by screenreaders)
  - Prevents value changes
  - Is visually distinct from disabled state
- This requires modifications to the Toggle component's props, state handling, and accessibility attributes

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js
packages/react/src/internal/useControllableState.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- Toggle.js is the main component that needs to be modified to support read-only state
- Toggle-test.js needs new test cases for read-only functionality
- Toggle.stories.js needs examples showing read-only state usage
- useControllableState.js handles state management that needs to account for read-only
- requiredIfValueExists.js handles prop validation that may need updates for read-only props
