Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Dropdown component is showing `title="[Object object]"` in the button output when using `itemToString` to return an object for icon selection
- This issue appeared after version 10.43/7.43 when title attribute was added to the button
- While the visual rendering still works, the tooltip shows incorrect text

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the Dropdown component automatically adding a title attribute to the button using the result of `itemToString`
- When `itemToString` returns an object (for icon rendering) instead of a string, the object gets converted to "[Object object]" when used as the title attribute
- The component needs to handle both string and object returns from `itemToString` differently for the button's title vs visual rendering

3. Most Related Files:
The key files involved in this issue are:

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuIcon.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/next/ListBoxTrigger.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `Dropdown.js` is the main component where the issue occurs and where the fix would be implemented
2. `ListBoxMenuIcon.js` handles the icon rendering in the dropdown button
3. `ListBoxMenuItem.js` manages individual menu items and their rendering
4. `ListBoxMenu.js` controls the overall menu structure
5. `ListBoxTrigger.js` handles the button trigger behavior where the title attribute is applied
