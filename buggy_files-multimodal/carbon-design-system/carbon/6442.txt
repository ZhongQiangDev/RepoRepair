Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `ContentSwitcher` component does not visually contrast well when placed on `ui-01` backgrounds
- This creates a visibility/accessibility issue where the component may be hard to distinguish from its background

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to theming/styling, specifically when the component is used on light backgrounds (`ui-01`)
- This suggests either:
  - Missing token values for light theme variants
  - Need for a `light` prop similar to other components like `TextInput`
  - Incorrect contrast ratios in the current styling

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js
packages/themes/tasks/build.js
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `ContentSwitcher.js` is the main component implementation where the light variant prop would need to be added
2. `tokens.js` contains the theme token definitions that would need updating for proper contrast
3. `ContentSwitcher-story.js` would need updating to demonstrate the new light variant
4. `build.js` handles theme generation and would need to process any new token values
5. `themes.js` manages theme maps and would need to incorporate new light variant styles

The fix would likely involve adding a `light` prop to ContentSwitcher and updating the relevant theme tokens to ensure proper contrast on light backgrounds.
