Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When the rail (side navigation) is collapsed, the submenu items remain expanded showing whitespace
- If a submenu item is focused/selected in collapsed state, the active state looks incorrect since the submenu items are not visible
- The rail should expand when a submenu item receives focus via keyboard navigation

2. Cause Analysis:
- The side navigation component is not properly handling the collapsed state for submenus
- The focus management logic is not triggering rail expansion when submenu items receive focus
- The state management between rail expansion and submenu visibility needs to be synchronized
- The issue appears to be in the UI Shell components, specifically the SideNav and related submenu components

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenuItem.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/UIShell-story.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- SideNav.js handles the core rail expansion/collapse behavior
- SideNavMenu.js manages submenu state and visibility
- SideNavMenuItem.js handles individual menu item focus and selection
- HeaderContainer.js manages the overall state of the side navigation
- UIShell-story.js contains the implementation examples and configurations

The fix would likely involve modifying these files to ensure proper state synchronization between rail collapse and submenu visibility, as well as implementing correct focus management behavior.
