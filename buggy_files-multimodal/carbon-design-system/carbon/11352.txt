Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The IconButton component has incorrect right padding
- The padding appears to be using the medium (md) button padding calculation instead of the intended IconButton padding

2. Cause Analysis:
- Based on the screenshot and description, this seems to be a CSS/styling issue where the IconButton component is inheriting or using padding values meant for regular medium-sized buttons
- The issue likely stems from either incorrect CSS class application or padding value definitions in the component styling
- Since it's specifically about IconButton padding, we need to look at files related to IconButton component implementation and styling

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/IconButton/index.js
packages/react/src/components/IconButton/next/IconButton.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `IconButton/index.js` is the main component file where the IconButton is defined and styled
- `IconButton/next/IconButton.stories.js` contains the story/example implementation showing how the component should look
- `Button/Button.js` is relevant since IconButton likely extends or uses Button component styling
- `Button/Button-story.js` and `Button-test.js` provide additional context about button styling and expected behavior

These files would need to be examined and potentially modified to fix the padding issue, with the IconButton component files being the most critical.
