Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The page selector in the data table pagination component becomes unusable when there are many pages
- When there are many pages (e.g., 650 entries with 10 items per page), the dropdown menu extends beyond the browser viewport
- Users have to scroll up and down to find and select a specific page number
- This creates a poor user experience

2. Cause Analysis:
- The pagination component uses a Select dropdown component for page selection
- When there are many pages, all page numbers are rendered as options in the dropdown
- The dropdown menu grows vertically with each additional option
- There's no optimization for handling large numbers of pages
- A text/number input would be more suitable for direct page entry

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the pagination issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarSearch.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `Pagination.js` is the main component that needs modification to change the page selector implementation
2. `TableToolbarSearch.js` provides input functionality that could be adapted for page number entry
3. `TextInput.js` could be used to replace the Select component for direct page entry
4. `Select.js` is the current problematic component being used
5. `NumberInput.js` could be used as an alternative input type specifically for numeric page entry
