Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The button elements in the Tabs component lack proper accessibility labels
- When screen width is decreased (mobile view), the tab buttons are missing associated labels
- This fails accessibility requirements as buttons need proper labeling for screen readers

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Tabs component renders buttons for navigation in mobile/narrow views
- These buttons are missing required accessibility attributes like `aria-labelledby` or explicit labels
- The issue appears specifically in the responsive/mobile layout when tabs collapse into buttons
- The core issue is in the button rendering logic within the Tabs component

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab-test.js
```

The `Tabs.js` file is most important as it contains the core Tabs component logic and button rendering. `Tab.js` handles individual tab rendering and accessibility. `TabContent.js` manages content display and may affect labeling. `Tabs-story.js` provides examples and documentation. `Tab-test.js` contains tests that should catch accessibility issues.

The fix would likely involve modifying the button rendering logic in `Tabs.js` to properly associate labels with buttons in the mobile view.
