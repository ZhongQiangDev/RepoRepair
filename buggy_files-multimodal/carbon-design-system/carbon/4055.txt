Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behaviors from Description:
- VoiceOver doesn't announce anything when entering web area
- Button label and state (aria-expanded) not announced properly
- "Below the fold content" is announced even when tile is not expanded
- User not required to press button before accessing below-fold content

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue appears to be improper ARIA attribute implementation and focus management in the expandable tile component. Specifically:
- Missing proper ARIA labels and states for the expand/collapse button
- Incorrect visibility/accessibility of collapsed content
- Focus order not properly managed with respect to expanded state
- Lack of proper ARIA expanded state management

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix these issues:

```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-test.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderPanel.js
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.js
packages/components/src/globals/js/misc/on-focus-by-keyboard.js
```

The `Tile.js` file is most important as it contains the core expandable tile implementation. The test file would need updates to verify accessibility fixes. `HeaderPanel.js` and `Accordion.js` contain similar expandable functionality patterns that could be referenced for proper ARIA implementation. The focus utility file would help implement proper keyboard focus management.
