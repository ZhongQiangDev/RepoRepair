Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Clicking the "Show Code" button under the Notifications component's "Docs" section displays irrelevant code showing `<FeatureFlags>` tags instead of the actual component code.
- The displayed code appears to be a wrapper component rather than the intended Notification component implementation.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to feature flag handling in the documentation/storybook system
- The code display is showing the feature flag wrapper that controls component versioning (v11 release) instead of the actual component code
- This suggests the documentation system is not properly extracting or displaying the source code, instead showing an intermediate wrapper component

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/FeatureFlags/index.js
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js
packages/react/.storybook/main.js
packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. FeatureFlags/index.js - Contains the feature flag context and provider that's incorrectly being displayed
2. Notification.js - The actual component whose code should be shown
3. Notification-story.js - The story file that generates the documentation and code examples
4. main.js - Storybook configuration that controls how code is displayed
5. ComponentToggle.js - Internal utility that may be affecting how components are wrapped with feature flags

The fix would likely involve modifying how Storybook extracts and displays source code, ensuring it shows the actual component implementation rather than the feature flag wrapper.
