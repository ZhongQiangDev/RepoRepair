Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that there is no context menu (right-click menu) component available in the Carbon Design System. Currently, overflow menus (indicated by meatball icons) are used as a substitute, which requires an additional click away from the context users want options for. This is particularly problematic in layouts like data grids where placing an overflow menu trigger in the UI is not always feasible.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause is the lack of a dedicated context menu component that can:
- Be triggered by right-click
- Position itself relative to the click location
- Support nested menu items
- Show keyboard shortcuts
- Handle disabled states properly
- Support radio-style selection

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to implementing a context menu component:

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
packages/components/src/components/floating-menu/floating-menu.js
packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
packages/components/src/components/overflow-menu/overflow-menu.js
```

These files are most important because:
- OverflowMenu.js contains the current menu implementation that would need to be adapted
- floating-menu.js handles menu positioning logic needed for context menus
- FloatingMenu.js provides React bindings for floating menu functionality
- OverflowMenuItem.js manages individual menu items and their states
- overflow-menu.js contains core overflow menu functionality that would need to be extended

These files would need to be modified or used as reference to implement the new context menu component with the desired functionality.
