Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `TableBatchActions` component currently doesn't include a "Select all" button next to the `totalSelected` text
- Users can't select items across all pages, only the current page
- There's no way to perform batch actions on all items across pages

2. Cause Analysis:
- The `TableBatchActions` component needs to be modified to include an optional "Select all" button
- The selection state management needs to handle cross-page selection
- The batch actions need to work with the expanded selection set
- The core issue lies in the batch actions and selection handling components

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.tsx
packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.tsx
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/state/sorting.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `TableBatchActions.js` - This is the main component that needs modification to add the "Select all" button
2. `TableSelectAll.tsx` - Handles the select-all functionality that needs to be extended for cross-page selection
3. `Selection.js` - Manages the selection state that needs to be updated to handle all-page selection
4. `DataTable.tsx` - The parent component that coordinates batch actions and selection
5. `sorting.js` - Helps maintain consistent state across pages when sorting with selections
