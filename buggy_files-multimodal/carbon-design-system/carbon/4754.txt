Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Carbon Accordion component's chevron is aligned to the end of the heading by default
- The desired behavior is to have an option to align the chevron at either the start or end of the heading through an `align` prop

2. Cause Analysis:
- The current Carbon Accordion component lacks a prop to control chevron alignment
- The chevron positioning is hardcoded to align at the end of the heading
- This requires users to add style overrides to change the alignment

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
packages/components/src/components/accordion/accordion.js
packages/components/src/components/accordion/AccordionItem.js
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.js
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js
packages/components/demo/js/components/ComponentExample/ComponentExample.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- The core Accordion component implementation is in accordion.js and AccordionItem.js
- Both the base components and React implementations need to be modified to support the new align prop
- The ComponentExample.js would need updates to demonstrate the new alignment functionality
- The changes would primarily involve adding the align prop and modifying the chevron positioning logic in these files
