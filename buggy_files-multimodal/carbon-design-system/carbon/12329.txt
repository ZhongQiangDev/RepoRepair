Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `DatePicker` component in v11 does not properly handle refs passed to it
- Specifically, the ref is not being forwarded to the underlying input element as it did in v10
- Users have to resort to querySelector to find the date picker input element that was previously accessible via ref

2. Cause Analysis:
- The root cause appears to be that the v11 DatePicker component is not using React.forwardRef
- forwardRef is needed to properly pass refs through component boundaries
- Without forwardRef, refs cannot be passed down to child/inner components
- This is a regression from v10 where ref forwarding was working correctly

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker-test.js
packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePickerInput/DatePickerInput.js
packages/react/src/internal/useControllableState.js
```

The files are ordered by importance because:
1. DatePicker.js is the main component that needs to implement forwardRef
2. DatePicker-test.js would need updated tests to verify ref forwarding
3. ComponentToggle.js handles feature toggling between v10/v11 components
4. DatePickerInput.js is the inner input component that should receive the forwarded ref
5. useControllableState.js manages controlled/uncontrolled state which interacts with refs
