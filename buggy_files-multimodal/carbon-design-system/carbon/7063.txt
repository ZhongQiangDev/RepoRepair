Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Ordered lists in Firefox start at random numbers (e.g., 7) instead of starting at 1
- This only happens in Firefox browser
- The issue is caused by Carbon's custom counter styles interfering with native ordered list numbering

2. Cause Analysis:
- Carbon Design System uses custom counters (`counter-reset: item`) and `::before` pseudo-elements for ordered list numbering instead of using native `decimal` styles
- When trying to override this to use native styles, the `counter-reset: item` style persists and causes Firefox to start numbering from random positions
- Overriding the style doesn't work - it needs to be completely removed for proper functionality

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files would be those handling ordered list styling and components. From the repository information:

```
packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/OrderedList.js
packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/OrderedList-test.js
packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/OrderedList-story.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
1. `OrderedList.js` is the main component file that defines the styling and behavior of ordered lists
2. `OrderedList-test.js` contains tests that could be updated to catch this Firefox-specific issue
3. `OrderedList-story.js` provides examples and documentation that could help verify the fix

The issue would likely need to be fixed in `OrderedList.js` by either removing the custom counter styles or providing an option to use native decimal styling.
