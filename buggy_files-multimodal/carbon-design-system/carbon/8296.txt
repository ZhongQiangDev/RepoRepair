Let me follow the steps:

1. Wrong Behaviors:
- When clicking a SideNavLink, the SideNav remains expanded instead of closing
- When clicking on the overlay or menu bar, the SideNav doesn't close (only closes when clicking HeaderMenuButton)

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to missing click event handlers for:
- SideNavLink components not triggering the parent's onClickSideNavExpand
- Overlay/menu bar areas not being connected to the SideNav's collapse functionality
- The state management in HeaderContainer isn't properly propagating collapse events

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavLink.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenuButton.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderNavigation.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- HeaderContainer.js manages the overall state of SideNav expansion
- SideNav.js contains the core navigation component that needs collapse handling
- SideNavLink.js needs to propagate click events to collapse the nav
- HeaderMenuButton.js currently handles the only working collapse trigger
- HeaderNavigation.js may need updates to handle overlay click events
