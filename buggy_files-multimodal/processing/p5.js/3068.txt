I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that `loadStrings()` in p5.js is omitting empty lines when loading a text file, whereas in Processing (the Java version), empty lines are included as empty strings in the returned array. This causes issues with line numbering, particularly when trying to debug shader errors.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is likely in the implementation of the `loadStrings()` function in p5.js. The function is probably filtering out empty strings from the array after splitting the loaded text file by line breaks. This behavior differs from Processing's implementation, which preserves empty lines.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/io/files.js
lib/addons/p5.dom.js
src/core/p5.Renderer.js
src/webgl/material.js
src/webgl/loading.js
```

The primary file is `src/io/files.js` which contains the implementation of `loadStrings()`. This is where the filtering of empty lines is likely happening.

The `lib/addons/p5.dom.js` file might be relevant as it could contain DOM-related file loading functionality.

`src/core/p5.Renderer.js` and `src/webgl/material.js` are relevant because the issue was discovered in the context of shader errors, and these files handle rendering and shader loading.

`src/webgl/loading.js` is included because it handles loading of various assets, which might interact with the `loadStrings()` function when loading shaders.
