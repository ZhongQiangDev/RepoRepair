I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that the `tint()` function is not supported in WebGL mode in p5.js, while it is supported in Processing with OPENGL render. The user is trying to apply a red tint with transparency (255,0,0,122) to an image texture in WebGL mode, but it's not working.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The tint functionality is implemented for 2D rendering in p5.js, but not for WebGL rendering. Looking at the repository information, we can see that:

1. The `tint()` function would likely be defined in the color/setting.js file
2. The WebGL renderer would need to be modified to support tinting textures
3. The texture handling in WebGL mode would need to be updated to apply tint values

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/webgl/p5.Texture.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
src/webgl/material.js
src/color/setting.js
src/image/p5.Image.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `p5.Texture.js` - This is the core file handling textures in WebGL mode and would need to be modified to support tinting
2. `p5.RendererGL.js` - The WebGL renderer would need to be updated to pass tint values to textures
3. `material.js` - Contains the `texture()` function for WebGL which would need to handle tint values
4. `color/setting.js` - Contains the `tint()` function implementation which would need to be made WebGL-compatible
5. `p5.Image.js` - May need updates to support tinting in WebGL context
