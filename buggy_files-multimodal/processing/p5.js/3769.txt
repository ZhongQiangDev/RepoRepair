I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves WebGL render buffers not being created correctly in p5.js. Specifically:
- When creating a retained-mode geometry, the code checks the *current* fill and stroke shaders to determine which buffers to create and which attributes to enable.
- If a shader without certain attributes is active when a geometry is created and cached, the corresponding buffers won't be created.
- Later, when using a different shader that requires those missing buffers/attributes, rendering fails or appears incorrect.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The root cause is in the geometry creation process in WebGL mode:
- The code in `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js` is making decisions about which buffers to create based on the *currently active* shaders.
- This is problematic because geometries are cached, but the buffers they need depend on which shader is active at creation time.
- The correct approach would be to create all possible buffers that might be needed by any shader, or to dynamically create buffers when a new shader requires them.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js
src/webgl/p5.Shader.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
src/webgl/p5.Geometry.js
```

The most important file is `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js` since it contains the specific code mentioned in the issue (lines 171-172) that's checking the current shaders to determine which buffers to create. This is where the core fix needs to be implemented.

The other files are important supporting files that interact with the buffer creation process:
- `p5.Shader.js` defines shader attributes and how they're enabled
- `p5.RendererGL.js` contains the main WebGL renderer implementation
- `p5.Geometry.js` defines the geometry objects that need the buffers
