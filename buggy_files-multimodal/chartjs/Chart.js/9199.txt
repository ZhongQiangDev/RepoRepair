Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- RTL (right-to-left) legend rendering is broken in v3
- Text goes off screen and is not rendered at all
- Legend box should be drawn to the right of the text like in v2, but isn't

2. Cause Analysis:
- The RTL helper functionality was refactored/changed in v3
- The `renderText` function is not properly handling alignment in RTL mode
- The text positioning calculation (`_textX`) needs to be RTL-aware
- The legend layout system needs to properly account for RTL text direction

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files for fixing the RTL legend issue:

```
src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
types/helpers/helpers.rtl.d.ts
src/core/core.layouts.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `helpers.rtl.js` contains the core RTL adaptation functionality that was refactored
2. `plugin.legend.js` handles legend rendering and positioning
3. `helpers.canvas.js` contains text rendering functions that need RTL awareness
4. `helpers.rtl.d.ts` defines the RTL adapter interface that may need updates
5. `core.layouts.js` handles overall layout including legend positioning

The fix would likely involve modifying how these components work together to properly handle RTL text direction in legends.
