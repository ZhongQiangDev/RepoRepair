Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A RangeError is thrown with message "minimumFractionDigits value is out of range"
- This occurs during chart creation (new Chart())
- The error trace shows it happens during number formatting in the scale system
- The chart library is calculating NaN for chart height

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error originates from `NumberFormat` constructor in the native JavaScript API
- Looking at the stack trace and screenshots:
  - The error occurs during scale numeric formatting
  - It happens when generating tick labels
  - The issue appears to be related to invalid fraction digits being passed to number formatting
  - The screenshots show NaN values being processed during chart construction
- This suggests the core issue is improper handling of invalid numeric values during scale initialization and tick generation

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
src/core/core.scale.js
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
src/core/core.layouts.js
src/core/core.controller.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- core.scale.js: Contains core scale functionality and tick generation logic
- scale.linear.js: Handles linear scale specifics where the error occurs
- helpers.intl.js: Contains the number formatting logic that's throwing the error
- core.layouts.js: Manages chart layout and dimensions which could affect height calculations
- core.controller.js: Manages chart initialization where the error surfaces

The error appears to originate from improper number formatting during scale initialization, making these files the most likely locations for implementing a fix.
