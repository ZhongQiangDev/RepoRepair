Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The LTTB (Largest Triangle Three Buckets) algorithm fails when running on a screen with 250% scaling
- The failure occurs with odd width values
- The algorithm produces negative avgRangeLength and rangeTo > data.length
- The issue only happens on the first screen (3840x2160 with 250% scaling) but works fine on the second screen (2560x1440 with 100% scaling)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how screen scaling affects width calculations in the LTTB decimation algorithm
- When the screen scaling is not 100%, odd width values can cause incorrect bucket width calculations
- This leads to invalid array index calculations in the algorithm, producing negative ranges or out-of-bounds indices
- The core issue likely lies in how the decimation plugin handles width values and array indices without accounting for screen scaling effects

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/plugins/plugin.decimation.js
src/core/core.config.js
src/core/core.controller.js
src/platform/platform.dom.js
src/helpers/helpers.dom.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. plugin.decimation.js contains the LTTB algorithm implementation and is directly responsible for the failing behavior
2. core.config.js handles configuration and scaling settings that affect the decimation
3. core.controller.js manages the overall chart behavior and plugin interactions
4. platform.dom.js handles platform-specific DOM operations including screen scaling
5. helpers.dom.js provides utility functions for DOM operations and screen measurements
