Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A PolarArea chart with a single data item shows tooltip and click interaction only on a tiny 1-2 pixel wide vertical line at the start of the arc
- The colored area filling the entire circle is not interactive despite being visually part of the data representation

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how hit detection and interaction areas are calculated for polar area charts when there is only one data point
- When a single item fills the entire circle (360 degrees), the interaction detection logic is likely only checking the starting edge of the arc rather than the full circular area
- This suggests an issue in either the polar area controller's hit detection code or the core interaction handling for polar charts

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/controllers/controller.polarArea.js
src/core/core.interaction.js
src/elements/element.arc.js
src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js
src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `controller.polarArea.js` is the main controller handling polar area chart behavior and hit detection
- `core.interaction.js` manages all chart interactions including hit testing and event handling
- `element.arc.js` defines how arc elements are drawn and their interaction boundaries
- `scale.radialLinear.js` handles the radial scale calculations which affect arc positioning
- `plugin.tooltip.js` manages tooltip behavior and positioning based on interaction points

The primary fix would likely need to be in the polar area controller's hit detection logic to properly handle single-item cases where the arc spans the full circle.
