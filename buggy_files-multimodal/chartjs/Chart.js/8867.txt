Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When xAxis is enabled, the chart adds padding on the left and right edges to center the first and last tick labels with their corresponding data points
- This causes the chart to not display full-width edge-to-edge when axis ticks are shown
- The user wants an option to render ticks inside the chart bounds instead

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how the chart calculates tick positions and label alignments
- Currently, ticks are positioned to align centrally with data points, causing labels to extend beyond chart boundaries
- There's no built-in option to render ticks inside the chart area while maintaining alignment with data points
- This is primarily a layout and scale rendering issue

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/core/core.layouts.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.controller.js
src/platform/platform.dom.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- core.layouts.js handles chart layout calculations and positioning
- core.scale.js manages scale rendering and positioning logic
- scale.linear.js contains specific implementation for linear scales (like the xAxis)
- core.controller.js manages overall chart rendering and updates
- platform.dom.js handles DOM-specific rendering and sizing calculations
