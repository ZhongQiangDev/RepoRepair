Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The border thickness has increased for chart bars since version 3.5.0
- The thicker border only affects the chart bars but not the legend
- Using borderWidth: 1 makes both chart and legend borders thinner than before

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a change in how border width is handled for bar elements specifically
- The issue affects the bar controller/element rendering but not legend rendering
- The change was introduced in version 3.5.0, suggesting modifications to core bar rendering logic

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files would be those handling bar elements and their styling, particularly border rendering. Based on the repository information:

```
src/elements/element.bar.js
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- element.bar.js directly handles bar rendering including borders
- controller.bar.js manages bar chart behavior and styling
- core.defaults.js contains default styling values that may have changed
- plugin.legend.js handles legend rendering separately from bars
- helpers.canvas.js provides core canvas drawing utilities used by both bars and legends

The root cause is likely in either element.bar.js or controller.bar.js where the border rendering logic was modified in version 3.5.0.
