Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When hover radius is set to 0, the bubble disappears on hover instead of maintaining its size
- When hover radius equals the radius, the bubble gets bigger instead of staying the same size

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the hover radius is being calculated and applied. The documentation states hover radius should be "additional" radius, meaning it should be added to the base radius. However, the current behavior suggests the hover radius is being used as the total radius on hover, causing:
- Zero hover radius = zero total radius (disappearing)
- Equal hover radius = double total radius (getting bigger)

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling bubble hover behavior:

```
src/elements/element.point.js
src/controllers/controller.bubble.js
src/core/core.interaction.js
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
src/core/core.element.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- element.point.js handles point elements including their hover states
- controller.bubble.js manages bubble-specific behavior and rendering
- core.interaction.js handles hover interactions
- helpers.canvas.js provides canvas rendering utilities including hover effects
- core.element.js contains base element functionality that affects hover behavior

The fix would likely involve modifying how hover radius is calculated and applied in these files, particularly in element.point.js or controller.bubble.js.
