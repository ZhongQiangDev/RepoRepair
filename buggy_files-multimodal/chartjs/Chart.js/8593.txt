Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The radar chart's rotation is stuck at the default -0.5*Math.PI angle
- User wants to set rotation to 1.22*Math.PI but it's not working

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to the rotation configuration of radar charts
- Looking at the code, radar charts inherit rotation behavior from radial scales
- The RadialLinearScale class handles rotation for radar charts
- The rotation setting needs to be properly configured through scale options

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/controllers/controller.radar.js
src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
src/core/core.config.js
src/platform/platform.dom.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. controller.radar.js - Directly handles radar chart configuration and rendering
2. scale.radialLinear.js - Contains the RadialLinearScale class that manages rotation
3. core.defaults.js - Defines default configurations including rotation settings
4. core.config.js - Handles configuration merging and resolution
5. platform.dom.js - Manages canvas rendering and transformations

The rotation issue is most likely caused by improper configuration handling in these components, particularly in how the radar controller interacts with the radial linear scale.
