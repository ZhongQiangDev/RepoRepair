Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Stacked line charts always begin at zero despite setting `beginAtZero: false`
- This affects the y-axis minimum tick calculation
- The expected behavior (shown in the jsfiddle) is that non-stacked lines respect the `beginAtZero: false` setting

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how the y-axis scale calculates its minimum value when stacking is enabled
- The scale is not properly considering the stacked values when determining the minimum tick value
- Even with `beginAtZero: false`, the scale defaults to starting at zero for stacked datasets

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling scale calculations and stacking:

```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/controllers/controller.line.js
src/helpers/helpers.options.js
src/core/core.datasetController.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- `scale.linear.js` handles linear scale calculations including min/max determination
- `core.scale.js` contains core scale functionality and tick generation
- `controller.line.js` manages line chart specifics including stacking behavior
- `helpers.options.js` processes scale options like `beginAtZero`
- `core.datasetController.js` handles dataset stacking and scale range updates

The fix would likely need to modify how minimum values are calculated in the linear scale when stacking is enabled, particularly in `scale.linear.js` and its interaction with stacking logic.
