Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When setting borderRadius, borderSkipped: false, and minBarLength on a bar chart dataset, bars with value 0 are not respecting the borderRadius setting for bottom corners
- The bottom corners appear as flat instead of rounded, creating an inconsistent appearance with non-zero value bars

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the bar element drawing logic
- When minBarLength is set, it forces a minimum height for bars, including 0-value bars
- The border radius calculation or application is likely not properly handling the case where borderSkipped is false and the bar has a 0 value
- The drawing logic may be treating the bottom corners differently when the actual value is 0, even though minBarLength gives it a visible height

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
src/elements/element.bar.js
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
types/geometric.d.ts
src/core/core.datasetController.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- element.bar.js contains the core bar drawing logic and border radius handling
- controller.bar.js manages bar data and rendering coordination
- helpers.canvas.js provides the low-level canvas drawing functions including rounded rectangles
- geometric.d.ts defines the types for border radius and corners
- core.datasetController.js contains base dataset rendering logic that may affect how bars are processed
