Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When rendering a scatter chart with locale set to 'de_DE', there's a RangeError indicating "minimumFractionDigits value is out of range"
- This occurs in the numeric tick formatting logic where `numDecimal` is calculated based on the logarithm of delta values

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs because `locale` is undefined when trying to format numbers using `formatNumber(tickValue, locale, options)`
- The code attempts to use `this.chart.options.locale` but this value appears to be undefined
- The calculation of `numDecimal` using `Math.max(Math.min(-1 * Math.floor(logDelta), 20), 0)` may produce invalid values for `minimumFractionDigits` when passed to number formatting

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/core/core.ticks.js
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- core.ticks.js handles tick formatting and numeric display logic
- helpers.intl.js contains the number formatting functionality using locale
- scale.linear.js manages linear scale behavior including tick generation
- core.defaults.js would handle default locale settings
- scale.linearbase.js contains base functionality for linear scales including tick calculations

The issue likely needs to be fixed by ensuring proper locale initialization and validation before number formatting attempts.
