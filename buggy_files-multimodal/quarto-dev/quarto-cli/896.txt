I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves images not being properly placed inside custom divs in revealjs format. Specifically:

1. When placing an image in a custom div with an arbitrary class (like `.qrcodeblock`), the image is "bumped" outside the div in the rendered output.
2. This only happens with custom divs - when using the built-in `.columns` class, images stay properly inside their containers.
3. The problem affects both standalone divs (Test A) and nested divs (Test C).

This suggests there's an issue with how revealjs format processes images within custom divs during the rendering pipeline.

## Cause of the Problem

The issue is likely in how Quarto processes and transforms markdown content for revealjs presentations. When custom divs are used, the image processing logic is incorrectly moving images outside their parent containers, while the built-in column layout has special handling that keeps images properly contained.

## Most Relevant Files

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
src/command/render/render.ts
src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts
src/command/render/layout.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-plugin.ts
```

The issue is most likely in the reveal.js format handling code, particularly in how it processes and transforms HTML content during rendering. The `format-reveal.ts` file would contain the main logic for revealjs presentations, while `render.ts` would handle the general rendering pipeline. The `codegen.ts` file might be involved in how the HTML is generated from markdown, and `layout.ts` would handle layout-specific transformations. Finally, `format-reveal-plugin.ts` might contain plugin-specific code that could be affecting how divs and images are processed.
