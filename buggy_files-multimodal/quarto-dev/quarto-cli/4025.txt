I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The problem involves a single Bokeh plot being wrongly identified as several subfigures. In the output image, we can see that a single Bokeh visualization is being split into three subfigures (1a, 1b, 1c), where 1b and 1c are empty and shouldn't exist.

This is likely happening because the system is incorrectly parsing or processing the Bokeh output, treating it as multiple separate figures when it should be treated as a single figure.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue appears to be related to how Quarto processes Bokeh outputs in Jupyter/Python code cells. When Bokeh generates its output, it might be creating multiple HTML elements or outputs that Quarto is interpreting as separate figures, rather than components of a single figure.

The problem is likely in the code that:
1. Processes Jupyter notebook outputs
2. Identifies and labels figures/subfigures
3. Handles Bokeh-specific output

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/core/jupyter/labels.ts
src/core/handlers/base.ts
src/command/render/codetools.ts
src/core/jupyter/preserve.ts
src/execute/jupyter/jupyter.ts
```

The `src/core/jupyter/labels.ts` file is likely the most important as it appears to contain functions related to labeling Jupyter cell outputs, including `shouldLabelCellContainer`, `hasTableLabel`, `cellLabel`, `resolveCaptions`, and `shouldLabelOutputContainer`. These functions would be directly involved in determining how outputs are labeled and grouped.

The `src/core/handlers/base.ts` file contains functions for processing cells and handling language-specific content, which would be relevant for processing Jupyter/Python cells with Bokeh output.

The `src/command/render/codetools.ts` file handles code-related properties and formatting, which could affect how code outputs are processed and displayed.

The `src/core/jupyter/preserve.ts` file deals with preserving HTML content in Jupyter notebooks, which is relevant since Bokeh outputs HTML content.

The `src/execute/jupyter/jupyter.ts` file contains functions for Jupyter notebook execution and conversion, which would be involved in processing the Bokeh output.
