I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with code annotation in PDF output.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that code annotation doesn't work correctly in PDF output. Specifically:
1. The `tikz` package is not included in the LaTeX output
2. The `\circled` command is not defined

These are needed to properly render code annotations (the numbered circles and corresponding explanations) in PDF output. The user provided an example where they have code blocks with annotations like `// <1>` and corresponding numbered explanations below.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem appears to be in the LaTeX processing pipeline for PDF output. When generating PDF files, Quarto needs to:
1. Include the `tikz` package in the LaTeX preamble
2. Define the `\circled` command to create the circled numbers for annotations

These components are missing in version 1.3.336, causing the code annotation feature to fail in PDF output.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/format/pdf/format-pdf.ts
src/command/render/filters.ts
src/command/render/latexmk/pdf.ts
src/command/render/render.ts
src/command/render/defaults.ts
```

The issue is most likely in `src/format/pdf/format-pdf.ts` which contains functions for processing code annotations in LaTeX/PDF output, including `function_58` that transforms list annotations into LaTeX circled numbers (`\circled{1}`). This file also contains the PDF format configuration and LaTeX post-processors.

The other files handle the rendering pipeline, filter parameters, and LaTeX compilation, which are all involved in properly setting up the LaTeX environment with the required packages and commands for code annotations.
