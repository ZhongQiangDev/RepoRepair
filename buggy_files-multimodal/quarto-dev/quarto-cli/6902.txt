I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with float crossrefs and unlabeled subfloats.

## Analysis of the Problem

### Wrong Behavior
When creating a figure with multiple subfigures in Quarto using the layout-ncol attribute, the subfigures are labeled as normal figures (Figure 1, Figure 2) rather than as subfigures (Figure 1a, Figure 1b).

### Cause Analysis
The issue occurs because Quarto generates different LaTeX code depending on whether the subfigures have explicit IDs:
1. When subfigures don't have explicit IDs (e.g., `#fig-surus`), Quarto uses `\caption{}` for each subfigure
2. When subfigures have explicit IDs, Quarto uses `\subcaption{\label{fig-surus}...}` instead

The problem is that Quarto should be generating proper subfigure labels regardless of whether explicit IDs are provided for the subfigures.

### Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, I need to identify files that handle figure/subfigure rendering, LaTeX output generation, and cross-referencing. The most relevant files would be those dealing with:
1. LaTeX output generation for figures
2. Cross-reference handling
3. Figure/subfigure processing

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/command/render/crossref.ts
src/core/handlers/base.ts
src/command/render/filters.ts
src/command/render/pandoc.ts
src/core/lib/yaml-schema/front-matter.ts
```

The `crossref.ts` file is likely the most important as it handles cross-referencing functionality. The `base.ts` file in the handlers directory probably manages how different content types (including figures) are processed. The `filters.ts` file would handle Pandoc filters which transform the document. The `pandoc.ts` file manages the Pandoc execution which converts Quarto to LaTeX. Finally, the `front-matter.ts` file might be relevant for handling YAML front matter which includes figure configurations.
