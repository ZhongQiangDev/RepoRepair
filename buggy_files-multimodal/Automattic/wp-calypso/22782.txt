I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with American Express credit card number formatting.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that American Express credit card numbers aren't being formatted correctly during checkout. 

- **Expected behavior**: American Express card numbers should be formatted as `1234 123456 12345` (4-6-5 pattern)
- **Actual behavior**: All card numbers are being formatted in groups of 4 digits: `1234 1234 5612 345` (4-4-4-3 pattern)

This is causing confusion for customers trying to verify their card numbers before submitting.

## Cause Analysis

The root cause appears to be that the credit card formatting logic is applying a uniform 4-digit grouping pattern to all card types, instead of using card-specific formatting patterns. American Express cards have a unique format (4-6-5) that differs from other card types like Visa and Mastercard (which use 4-4-4-4).

## Files That Need to Be Modified

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
client/lib/credit-card-details/masking.js
client/components/credit-card-form-fields/index.jsx
client/components/upgrades/credit-card-number-input/index.jsx
client/lib/credit-card-details/validation.js
client/my-sites/checkout/checkout/credit-card-payment-box.jsx
```

The `masking.js` file is likely the primary file that needs modification as it would contain the logic for formatting credit card numbers. The other files are related to credit card input handling, validation, and display in the checkout process, which might need adjustments to properly handle the American Express card format.
