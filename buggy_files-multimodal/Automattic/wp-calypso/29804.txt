I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is about misleading text on the "checkout thank you" page for WordPress.com Premium plan upgrades. The current text states:

"Enrich your posts with video and audio, uploaded directly on your site. No ads or limits. The Premium plan also adds 10GB of file storage."

There are two problems with this text:
1. It mentions "no limits" which is incorrect since there is a storage limit for the Premium plan
2. It states "adds 10GB of file storage" which is confusing because:
   - For free WordPress.com sites upgrading to Premium, it does add 10GB (from 3GB to 13GB total)
   - For Personal plan sites upgrading to Premium, it doesn't add 10GB since Personal already has 6GB (it would add 7GB to reach 13GB total)

The expected fix is to:
1. Remove the "no limits" reference
2. Update the text to state "The WordPress.com Premium plan offers 13GB of file storage" to be clear about the total storage rather than the incremental amount.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
client/my-sites/checkout/checkout-thank-you/premium-plan-details.jsx
client/blocks/product-purchase-features-list/video-audio-posts.jsx
client/blocks/plan-storage/index.jsx
client/blocks/plan-storage/bar.jsx
client/lib/plans/index.js
```

The first file (`premium-plan-details.jsx`) is likely the main file that needs to be edited as it would contain the text displayed on the checkout thank you page for Premium plans. 

The second file (`video-audio-posts.jsx`) appears to handle the description of video and audio post features, which is directly related to the problematic text.

The other files relate to plan storage information and would be important for ensuring consistent messaging about storage limits across the application.
