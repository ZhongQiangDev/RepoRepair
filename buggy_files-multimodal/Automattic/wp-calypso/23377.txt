I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when a user trashes a post in the editor:
1. User clicks the trash button in the editor settings
2. User confirms the trash action
3. The button changes to "Trashing..."
4. After a few seconds, instead of being redirected away from the editor, a restore dialog appears asking the user to restore the post to edit it

This is counterintuitive because:
- The user just intentionally trashed the post
- The user is immediately being asked to undo that action
- The user should be redirected away from the editor after trashing a post

The root cause appears to be in how the application handles post trashing. After successfully trashing a post, the editor is still trying to edit a trashed post, which triggers the restore dialog instead of redirecting the user to a different page.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

```
client/post-editor/post-editor.jsx
client/post-editor/editor-ground-control/index.jsx
client/state/posts/actions.js
client/post-editor/editor-delete-post/index.jsx
client/post-editor/editor-forbidden/index.jsx
```

The main issue is likely in the post-editor.jsx file, which is the core editor component that handles post state changes including trashing. This file contains the `onTrashingPost` method that should handle redirecting the user after a post is trashed.

The editor-ground-control component manages the main editor controls and might need updates to handle the post trashing flow correctly.

The posts/actions.js file contains the Redux actions for post operations including the `trashPost` function that would need to be examined to ensure proper state handling.

The editor-delete-post component handles the UI for deleting/trashing posts and might need modifications to ensure proper behavior after trashing.

The editor-forbidden component might be involved in showing the restore dialog when a user tries to edit a trashed post, and might need adjustments to handle this case differently.
