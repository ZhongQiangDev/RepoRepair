I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is about the "Upcoming Charges" section in the billing interface. According to the screenshot and description, this section currently appears to be "tacked on" to the main billing history view. The request is to move it to a separate tab, either under "Pending Payments" or as its own "Upcoming Charges" tab.

Looking at the screenshot, we can see that the current UI has the upcoming charges displayed below the past transactions in the same view, which feels disjointed. The solution would involve restructuring the billing history page to have separate tabs for past transactions and upcoming charges.

## Files That Need to Be Modified

```
client/me/billing-history/main.jsx
client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx
client/me/purchases/purchases-list/header/index.jsx
client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js
client/state/selectors/get-past-billing-transactions.js
```

These files are the most critical for implementing this change because:

1. `client/me/billing-history/main.jsx` - This is the main component that renders the billing history page. It currently includes both the past transactions and upcoming charges in the same view. This file needs to be modified to implement a tabbed interface instead.

2. `client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx` - This component renders the upcoming charges table. It will need to be adapted to work within the new tabbed interface.

3. `client/me/purchases/purchases-list/header/index.jsx` - This file contains the navigation header for the purchases section. It will need to be updated to include the new tab for upcoming charges.

4. `client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js` - This selector retrieves the upcoming billing transactions data. It may need adjustments to work with the new UI structure.

5. `client/state/selectors/get-past-billing-transactions.js` - This selector retrieves the past billing transactions. It works in conjunction with the upcoming transactions selector and may need corresponding changes.
