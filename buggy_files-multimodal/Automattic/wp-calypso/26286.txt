I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that an app banner related to Stats is being shown when visiting `/stats/activity/YOURSITESLUG` on a mobile device. According to the description, this happens because in `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx` (line 149), the code only checks if the path starts with `/stats` but doesn't discriminate between different sections within stats, like the `/activity` subsection.

The banner should not appear in the `/stats/activity/` section, but the current Redux state doesn't have enough information to distinguish this path from other stats paths.

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause is that the app banner component is using a simple check for `/stats` in the URL path, but it needs more granular control to exclude specific subsections like `/stats/activity/`.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

```
client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
client/state/selectors/get-current-route.js
client/state/ui/actions.js
client/state/routing/middleware.js
client/state/action-log/index.js
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx` since it contains the logic that determines when to show the app banner. The code needs to be updated to exclude the `/stats/activity/` path.

The other files are related to the Redux state management for the current route, which would be needed to properly track and distinguish between different stats subsections. These files help manage the route state that the app banner component relies on to make its visibility decisions.
