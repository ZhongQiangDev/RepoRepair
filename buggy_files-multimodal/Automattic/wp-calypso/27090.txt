I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is about bringing back view counts in the Blog Posts list. According to the description and screenshots:

1. **Wrong behavior**: View counts are no longer displayed in the Blog Posts list, as shown in the "After" screenshot.
2. **Expected behavior**: View counts should be visible in the Blog Posts list, as shown in the "Before" screenshot.
3. **Solution approach**: The team is looking to implement this with a less resource-intensive approach that delivers better performance for both customers' devices and servers.
4. **Requirements**: The solution needs to work for both single site and All My Sites mode, with an acceptable number of requests.

Based on the PR link and the acceptance criteria, the team needs to:
1. Create a post-views endpoint that can get total views for multiple posts in one request
2. Update the Posts list to use this endpoint and display "x Recent Views"

## Files Most Related to the Fix

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-action-counts/index.jsx
client/my-sites/post-total-views.jsx
client/state/posts/actions.js
client/state/stats/posts/selectors.js
client/state/data-layer/wpcom/posts/views/index.js
```

The reasoning for these files:

1. `client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-action-counts/index.jsx` - This is the component that displays action counts (including views) for posts in the post list.

2. `client/my-sites/post-total-views.jsx` - This file specifically handles the display of post view counts.

3. `client/state/posts/actions.js` - This file contains Redux actions for posts, which would need to be updated to fetch view counts.

4. `client/state/stats/posts/selectors.js` - This file contains selectors for post stats, including view counts.

5. `client/state/data-layer/wpcom/posts/views/index.js` - This file would likely need to be created or modified to implement the new endpoint for fetching post views in a more efficient way.

Note: The last file might not exist yet and would need to be created as part of the solution, as mentioned in the task list where Grant was assigned to "Build post-views endpoint".
