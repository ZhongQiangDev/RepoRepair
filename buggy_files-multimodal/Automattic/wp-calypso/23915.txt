I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves a broken "Edit" link in the Reader for the user's own posts on Jetpack sites. When the user clicks on the Edit link below a post in the Reader, instead of entering the editor, the page enters a weird state where the top and side bars disappear, but the reader content is still displayed.

This suggests a navigation/routing issue where clicking the Edit link fails to properly transition from the Reader view to the Editor view for the user's own posts.

## Cause of the Issue

Based on the problem description and repository information, the issue appears to be related to how the Reader handles the Edit link for posts. When a user clicks the Edit link, the application should navigate to the post editor, but instead, it's entering a partial state where some UI elements disappear while others remain.

This suggests:
1. The Edit link might be using an incorrect URL or routing mechanism
2. There could be an issue with the transition between Reader and Editor components
3. The navigation logic for Jetpack sites might be different from regular WordPress.com sites

client/state/posts/utils.js
client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-actions-ellipsis-menu/edit.jsx
```

The issue is most likely in the Reader's post permalink component that handles the Edit link functionality. The post-editor file would be involved in the destination that should be loaded. The posts/utils.js file likely contains utility functions for generating edit URLs, and the post-actions-ellipsis-menu/edit.jsx would contain similar edit link functionality that might work correctly (for comparison).
