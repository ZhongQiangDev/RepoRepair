I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that the "Priority support" card on the plans page has a different layout compared to other cards. Specifically:
- Other cards have the icon on the left and content on the right
- The "Priority support" card has the icon on the right and content on the left

This is a UI inconsistency that needs to be fixed to maintain visual harmony across all cards.

## Cause Analysis

Based on the repository information, this appears to be an issue with the component that renders the "Priority support" card. The inconsistency likely stems from either:
1. A different component being used for this specific card
2. The same component being used but with different props or CSS classes
3. A styling issue in the component that renders these cards

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, the most relevant files that would need to be edited are:

```
client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx
client/my-sites/plan-features/index.jsx
client/my-sites/plan-features/item.jsx
client/my-sites/plans/current-plan/header.jsx
client/components/card/index.jsx
```

The `happiness-support/index.jsx` file is likely the most important as it appears to be responsible for rendering the support-related UI components, including the "Priority support" card. The inconsistency is probably in how this component structures its layout compared to other feature cards.

The other files are related to plan features and cards, which would be involved in rendering the consistent layout seen in the other cards. These would serve as reference for how the "Priority support" card should be structured.
