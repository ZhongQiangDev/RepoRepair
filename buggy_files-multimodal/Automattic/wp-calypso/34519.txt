I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that an app nudge (to download the mobile app) was removed from the Checklist feature since it was considered less of a site setup task and more of a post-launch onboarding nudge. The task is to add this app nudge to the Checklist "congratulations" screen that appears after a user completes all their tasks.

According to the mock image, the view from `/me/get-apps` should be used as a nudge to both desktop and mobile apps on the congratulations screen.

## Cause of the Issue

The app nudge component needs to be added to the congratulations screen that appears after completing all checklist tasks. This requires modifying the checklist completion UI to include the app promotion component.

## Most Related Files

```
client/my-sites/checklist/index.js
client/blocks/app-promo/index.jsx
client/me/get-apps/index.jsx
client/me/get-apps/mobile-download-card.jsx
client/me/get-apps/desktop-download-card.jsx
```

The `client/my-sites/checklist/index.js` file is the most important as it likely contains the routing and main component for the checklist feature, including the congratulations screen.

The `client/blocks/app-promo/index.jsx` file contains the app promotion component that can be reused on the congratulations screen.

The `client/me/get-apps/index.jsx`, `client/me/get-apps/mobile-download-card.jsx`, and `client/me/get-apps/desktop-download-card.jsx` files contain the components for the app download page that should be used as a reference or directly incorporated into the congratulations screen according to the mock.
