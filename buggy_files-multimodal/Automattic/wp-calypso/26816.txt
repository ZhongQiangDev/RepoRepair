I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The GitHub problem description is about creating a modal that displays when the `gutenberg` feature flag is enabled, allowing users to choose between the Classic Editor and Gutenberg editor. The modal should appear on the `/post` and `/page` editor pages.

The follow-up tasks indicate several issues that need to be addressed:
- Remember dismissal in user preferences & default dialog to visible on load
- Redirect to wp-admin for Jetpack/AT sites (TBD)
- Add click tracking events to both buttons in dialog (marked as completed)
- Make sidebar image clickable (marked as completed)

The main issue that needs to be fixed is remembering the user's dismissal preference and defaulting the dialog to visible on load.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
client/state/preferences/actions.js
client/state/preferences/selectors.js
client/state/preferences/reducer.js
client/state/preferences/store.js
client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js
```

The issue is primarily related to user preferences management. When a user dismisses the Gutenberg modal, this preference needs to be saved and respected on future visits. The files I've identified handle:

1. `client/state/preferences/actions.js` - Contains actions for setting and saving user preferences, which would be needed to save the dismissal state.

2. `client/state/preferences/selectors.js` - Contains selectors to retrieve preference values, which would be used to check if the user has previously dismissed the modal.

3. `client/state/preferences/reducer.js` - Handles state updates for preferences, which would need to include the Gutenberg modal dismissal state.

4. `client/state/preferences/store.js` - Manages the preferences store, which would store the dismissal preference.

5. `client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js` - Contains utility functions for handling dismissals, which could be referenced or adapted for the Gutenberg modal.

These files would need to be modified to implement the "remember dismissal in userprefs & default dialog to visible on load" requirement from the follow-up tasks.
