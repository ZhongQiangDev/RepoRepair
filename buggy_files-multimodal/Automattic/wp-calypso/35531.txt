I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

### Wrong Behavior
The upgrade nudge is being shown to users with editor and author roles in the media page (wordpress.com/media), even though these users cannot upgrade a site. Only admins should see this upgrade nudge.

### Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be that the upgrade nudge component is being displayed to all user roles without checking if the current user has the capability to upgrade the site. Since only admins can upgrade a site, the component should check the user's role or capabilities before rendering the upgrade nudge.

Based on the repository information, this is likely related to a component that displays upgrade nudges in the media library or media page. The component probably needs to be modified to check user permissions before displaying the upgrade nudge.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

```
client/my-sites/media-library/content.jsx
client/my-sites/media/main.jsx
client/blocks/upgrade-nudge-expanded/index.jsx
client/blocks/domain-to-plan-nudge/index.jsx
client/lib/site/utils.js
```

The most important file is likely `client/my-sites/media-library/content.jsx` as it appears to be the main component for the media library content where the upgrade nudge is being displayed. It would need to be modified to check user permissions before rendering the upgrade nudge.

The second file, `client/my-sites/media/main.jsx`, is the main component for the media page and might be responsible for including the upgrade nudge.

The third and fourth files (`client/blocks/upgrade-nudge-expanded/index.jsx` and `client/blocks/domain-to-plan-nudge/index.jsx`) are likely the actual upgrade nudge components that need to be modified to check user permissions.

The fifth file, `client/lib/site/utils.js`, contains utility functions including `userCan` which would be useful for checking if a user has the capability to upgrade a site.
