I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with gaps between two-line text in OpenLayers labels.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that there's an unwanted space/gap between lines when using multi-line text in OpenLayers labels. The user demonstrates this with a simple example:
```
text: new ol.style.Text({ 
    text: 3.5 +'\nbar' 
})
```
The screenshot shows a visible gap between the "3.5" and "bar" text lines, which the user notes wasn't present in OpenLayers v2.13 but exists in v4.6.4 and later.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue is likely in the text rendering code of OpenLayers, specifically in how the `ol.style.Text` class handles multi-line text. When text contains newline characters (`\n`), the renderer is adding extra vertical spacing between the lines. This is probably happening in either:
- The `Text` style class that defines text properties
- The canvas rendering code that draws the text
- The text measurement/layout utilities

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/style/Text.js
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
src/ol/render/canvas.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
```

The `src/ol/style/Text.js` file is most important as it defines the core text styling properties. The issue is likely in how line spacing is handled when rendering multi-line text, which would be implemented in the canvas rendering files, particularly in `TextBuilder.js` and `Executor.js` which handle the actual drawing of text on the canvas. The `render/canvas.js` file contains utilities for text measurement and rendering, while `Immediate.js` handles immediate mode rendering of text.
