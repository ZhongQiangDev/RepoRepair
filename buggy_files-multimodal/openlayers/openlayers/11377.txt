I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the performance issue with the pointermove event in version 6.4.0.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem description indicates that the performance of the `pointermove` event is significantly slower in version 6.4.0 compared to 6.3.1. This is visible in the cursor movement and affects operations like zoom and panning. The issue is demonstrated with 1000 features with non-cached styles.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the repository information, this appears to be a regression in how OpenLayers handles pointer movement events. The most likely causes would be:

1. Changes in event handling for pointer movements
2. Inefficient feature detection or hit testing during pointer movement
3. Style calculation or rendering issues during pointer interactions
4. Changes in how cursor styles are updated during pointer movement

Looking at the files, I can see that several handle pointer movement events and cursor style changes, particularly in the context of feature detection.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js
examples/custom-interactions.js
src/ol/events.js
src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js
src/ol/events/condition.js
```

The `MapBrowserEventHandler.js` is likely the most critical file as it's responsible for handling pointer events and dispatching them as map browser events. The issue is probably in how it processes the `pointermove` event.

The `custom-interactions.js` example shows how cursor styles are changed during pointer movement, which is mentioned as being slow in the issue.

The `events.js` file contains the core event handling system, which could be causing performance issues if event listeners are not being managed efficiently.

The `DragPan.js` interaction handles dragging operations which are mentioned as being affected by the performance issue.

Finally, `events/condition.js` contains utility functions for checking event conditions, which might be involved in the performance degradation during pointer movement.
