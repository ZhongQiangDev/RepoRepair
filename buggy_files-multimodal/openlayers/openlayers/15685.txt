I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue with `setFill()` creating an additional semitransparent layer.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue involves using `setFill()` on a VectorTile layer's style, which creates an unwanted additional semitransparent layer on top of other layers. This happens when using `ol.layer.VectorTile` with a style that includes a fill. Removing the fill from the style resolves the issue, but the user needs to be able to use fill styling.

## Analyzing the Cause
The problem appears to be in how OpenLayers handles fill styles for VectorTile layers. When `setFill()` is called on a style, it's creating an additional layer or rendering the fill in a way that creates a semitransparent overlay across the entire tile, rather than just filling the vector features themselves.

This suggests an issue in either:
1. How styles are applied to VectorTile layers
2. How the fill is rendered in the WebGL or Canvas renderer for vector tiles
3. How the style's fill property is processed

src/ol/render/webgl/VectorTileLayerRenderer.js
src/ol/render/Feature.js
```

The issue is most likely in the VectorTile layer implementation or its renderers. The `VectorTile.js` file defines the layer type that's experiencing the problem. The `Style.js` file would contain the `setFill()` method that's causing the issue. The renderer files are responsible for actually drawing the vector tiles with the applied styles, which is where the unwanted semitransparent layer is being created. Finally, `Feature.js` is included as it handles how features are represented for rendering, which could be related to how fills are applied.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue involves the `setFill()` method for styling VectorTile layers. When using this method, it creates an additional semi-transparent layer on top of other layers, which is not the expected behavior. The user wants the fill to only apply to the vector tile itself without creating this "ghost layer".

Looking at the problem description and the attached image, it appears that when applying a fill style with transparency to a VectorTile layer, the renderer is incorrectly drawing an additional shape (possibly the tile's bounding box) with that fill style, rather than just filling the actual vector features within the tile.

## Files That Need Editing

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/ol/render/canvas/PolygonBuilder.js
src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js
src/ol/style/Style.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
```

The issue is most likely in how the fill style is applied to vector tiles in the rendering pipeline. The `PolygonBuilder` and `ExecutorGroup` classes are responsible for rendering polygons and managing rendering instructions, while the `VectorTileLayer` renderer handles the specific rendering of vector tiles. The `Style` class defines how features are styled, and the `Immediate` renderer handles direct rendering to the canvas.
