I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves OpenLayers not working properly with proj4js version 2.6.1 and above. Specifically:
- With proj4js 2.6.0, both Mercator projection and WMTS layer projection (EPSG:2180) work correctly
- With proj4js 2.6.1, layers are rotated incorrectly when using different projections

The issue appears to be related to axis order interpretation in proj4js 2.6.1, as mentioned in the description: "Fixed interpretation of axis order".

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The core issue is likely related to how OpenLayers handles coordinate transformations between different projections when using proj4js. 

In proj4js 2.6.1, they fixed the interpretation of axis order, which means that coordinates might now be interpreted differently (e.g., latitude/longitude vs longitude/latitude) compared to previous versions. This change in axis order interpretation is causing the rotation issues observed in the screenshots.

OpenLayers needs to be updated to handle this change in proj4js correctly, particularly in the code that interfaces with proj4js for coordinate transformations.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/proj/proj4.js
src/ol/proj.js
src/ol/proj/transforms.js
src/ol/proj/Projection.js
src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `src/ol/proj/proj4.js` - This file directly handles the integration with proj4js, including registering projections and transformations. It's the primary interface between OpenLayers and proj4js.

2. `src/ol/proj.js` - This is the core projection module that manages coordinate transformations and projection handling in OpenLayers.

3. `src/ol/proj/transforms.js` - This file manages the coordinate transformation functions between different projections, which is directly related to the axis order issue.

4. `src/ol/proj/Projection.js` - This defines the Projection class which encapsulates properties of map projections, including axis orientation.

5. `src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js` - This file specifically handles the WGS84 projection (EPSG:4326), which is often involved in transformations and could be affected by axis order changes.

The fix would likely involve updating how OpenLayers handles axis order when working with proj4js 2.6.1 and above, ensuring that the coordinate transformations account for the fixed axis order interpretation in the newer versions of proj4js.
