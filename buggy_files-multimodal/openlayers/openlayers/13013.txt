I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue with black tiles in DataTileSource and WebGLTileLayer.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves black tiles when using `ol.layer.WebGLTile` with data loaded from `ol.source.DataTile` using a custom tile grid. The error message indicates a texture upload problem:

```
WebGL warning: texImage: Desired upload requires more data than is available: (767 rows plus 770 pixels needed, 767 rows plus 258 pixels available)
```

This suggests a mismatch between the expected and actual data size when uploading tile data to WebGL textures. The issue appears to be related to how the WebGLTileLayer handles the dimensions of data from DataTileSource, particularly with custom tile grids where the tile sizes are non-standard.

The problem likely occurs in the WebGL rendering pipeline where the tile data is processed and uploaded to the GPU. The error indicates that the code is trying to upload more data than is available, which results in black tiles being displayed.

## Most Related Files

src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/DataTile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` - This is the primary file implementing the WebGLTile layer that's showing black tiles. It handles the WebGL-specific rendering logic and style parsing for tile data.

2. `src/ol/source/DataTile.js` - This file implements the DataTileSource mentioned in the issue, which is responsible for providing the tile data that's not being rendered correctly.

3. `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` - This file contains the WebGL-specific renderer for tile layers, which would be responsible for uploading tile data to WebGL textures - exactly where the error is occurring.

4. `src/ol/DataTile.js` - This file defines the DataTile class that represents individual tiles from a DataTileSource, handling the actual data that's being processed.

5. `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` - This is likely relevant as a parent class or related implementation that might provide context for how tile data should be properly handled.

The issue is likely in how the WebGLTileLayer renderer processes tiles from DataTileSource, particularly with respect to handling custom tile sizes that don't match what the WebGL renderer expects.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves black tiles appearing when using `ol.layer.WebGLTile` with `ol.source.DataTile` and a custom tile grid. The error message indicates a texture upload problem:

```
WebGL warning: texImage: Desired upload requires more data than is available: (767 rows plus 770 pixels needed, 767 rows plus 258 pixels available)
```

This suggests a mismatch between the expected and actual data sizes when uploading tile data to WebGL textures. The tile grid configuration specifies:
- Extent: `[0, -23828, 23903, 0]`
- Sizes: `[[1, 1], [7, 7], [25, 25], [100, 100]]`
- Tile sizes: `[[770, 768], [240, 240], [240, 240], [240, 240]]`

The error specifically mentions that 770 pixels are needed in a row, but only 258 are available, which aligns with the first tile size being `[770, 768]`.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue appears to be related to how WebGL handles texture data from `DataTileSource` with custom tile grids. The error suggests that when uploading the tile data to WebGL, the system is expecting more data than is actually available. This could be due to:

1. Incorrect handling of tile dimensions in WebGL texture uploads
2. A mismatch between the declared tile size and the actual data size
3. Issues with how the data is being processed before uploading to WebGL textures

The problem likely stems from changes in PRs #11532 or #12024 as mentioned in the description.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js` - This file handles the uploading of tile data to WebGL textures, which is directly related to the error message about texture upload.

2. `src/ol/source/DataTile.js` - This is the source being used that's experiencing the issue, and would contain the logic for how tile data is provided.

3. `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` - This is the layer type mentioned in the issue that's not rendering properly.

4. `src/ol/webgl/Helper.js` - This file contains WebGL utility functions that would be involved in texture handling and rendering.

5. `src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js` - This handles the custom tile grid configuration which is part of the issue description.

The fix would likely involve adjusting how tile dimensions are handled during the WebGL texture upload process, particularly for custom tile grids with non-standard dimensions.
