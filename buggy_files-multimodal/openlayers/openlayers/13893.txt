I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with the graticule labels showing irregular intervals.

## Problem Analysis

The issue described shows that the graticule (grid lines on the map) appears to have regular spacing, but the labels display irregular intervals (3', 3'.01'', 2'.59''). This inconsistency between the visual grid and its labels is confusing to users.

Looking at the screenshot, we can see that while the grid lines appear evenly spaced, the labels show slightly different values that don't follow a clean pattern. This suggests that there's an issue with how the graticule labels are being calculated or formatted.

## Cause of the Problem

The most likely cause is that the graticule is correctly drawing evenly spaced lines at regular intervals, but the labels are showing the actual geographic coordinates with their precise values rather than being "rounded" to show the intended regular intervals.

This is probably happening because:
1. The graticule is drawing lines at regular pixel/screen intervals
2. The labels are showing the exact geographic coordinates of those lines
3. Due to projection distortions or floating-point precision, these exact coordinates don't match perfectly rounded values

## Files That Need to Be Modified

```
src/ol/layer/Graticule.js
examples/graticule.js
src/ol/coordinate.js
src/ol/string.js
```

### Explanation:

1. `src/ol/layer/Graticule.js` - This is the main class that implements the graticule functionality. It handles both the drawing of the grid lines and the generation of labels. The issue is most likely in how this class calculates or formats the labels for the grid lines.

2. `examples/graticule.js` - This is the example file mentioned in the issue. It might contain specific configuration that affects how the graticule is displayed and labeled.

3. `src/ol/coordinate.js` - This file contains utilities for handling coordinates, including formatting functions that might be used by the graticule for generating labels. The issue could be related to how coordinates are processed or formatted.

4. `src/ol/string.js` - This file includes string formatting utilities that might be used for formatting the coordinate labels. The inconsistent decimal places in the labels suggest a formatting issue that might be addressed here.

The primary fix would likely involve modifying the label generation in `src/ol/layer/Graticule.js` to ensure that labels show rounded values that match the visual grid spacing, rather than showing the exact geographic coordinates with their slight variations.
