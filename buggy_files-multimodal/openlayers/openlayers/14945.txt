I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves the ImageArcGISRest source in OpenLayers 7.4, specifically with its default ratio parameter value of 1.5. This causes two issues:
1. Layer-Map Mismatch: When computer zoom/scaling is not 100%, loading ArcGIS MapServer layers with ratio values other than 1 or 1.5 causes misalignment.
2. Layer-Map Mismatch after Rotation: Even with ratio set to 1.5, misalignment occurs after map rotation.

## Analyzing the Cause
The root cause appears to be in the ImageArcGISRest source implementation. The default ratio value of 1.5 is causing rendering issues when the device has a non-standard zoom level or when the map is rotated. The ratio parameter affects how the image is scaled relative to the viewport, and the current implementation doesn't handle certain scenarios correctly.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/source/ImageArcGISRest.js
src/ol/Image.js
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
src/ol/render/canvas.js
src/ol/transform.js
```

The primary file that needs modification is `src/ol/source/ImageArcGISRest.js` as it likely contains the default ratio setting. The other files are supporting components that handle image rendering, reprojection, canvas operations, and transformations which may be involved in the rendering pipeline that's affected by the ratio parameter.
