I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the gutter option issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that the gutter (buffer) option is currently only supported by TileWMS source, but other tile sources like Nextzen and Mapbox also support tile buffers. Additionally, when rendering with WebGL, the TileWMS gutter is removed before creating the texture, which doesn't prevent edge effects.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue has two main components:
1. The gutter option is not available for tile sources other than TileWMS (like XYZ and DataTile)
2. The WebGL rendering pipeline doesn't properly handle the gutter when creating textures, causing visible edge effects where tiles join

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/source/XYZ.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```

These files are the most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/source/TileWMS.js` - Currently the only source with gutter support, which needs to be used as a reference
2. `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` - The base class for tile image sources that would need to be modified to support gutters more broadly
3. `src/ol/source/XYZ.js` - One of the sources mentioned in the issue that needs gutter support
4. `src/ol/source/DataTile.js` - Another source mentioned in the issue that needs gutter support
5. `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` - Handles WebGL rendering of tiles and needs to be modified to properly handle gutters during texture creation
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves the "gutter" (or buffer) option for tile sources. Currently, this option is only supported by TileWMS, but other tile sources like Nextzen and Mapbox also support tiles with gutters/buffers. The issue manifests as visible edge effects (seams) where tiles join, as shown in the provided image.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The cause appears to be:
1. The gutter option is only implemented for TileWMS source but not for other tile sources like XYZ and DataTile
2. Even for WebGL tile layers using TileWMS, the gutter is removed before creating the texture, which doesn't prevent edge effects
3. The gutter should be handled similarly to layer extents to avoid visible seams between tiles

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/source/XYZ.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
```

Note: While `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` and `src/ol/source/DataTile.js` weren't in the provided repository information, they would likely be needed since:
1. TileImage is the base class for XYZ and other tile sources
2. DataTile was specifically mentioned in the feature request
3. The WebGL tile layer handling needs to be modified to properly handle gutters when creating textures
