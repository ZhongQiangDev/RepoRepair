I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that the `setOpacity` function for image styles in feature styles is not working in OpenLayers version 6.2.0, whereas it worked in version 6.1.1. Specifically, the feature blinking effect (achieved by changing opacity) no longer works after the update.

From the provided JSFiddle examples:
- In 6.1.1, the feature blinks as expected: https://jsfiddle.net/o3k9yjqh/
- In 6.2.0, the feature does not blink: https://jsfiddle.net/ob3sdq7h/1/

This suggests that there's an issue with how opacity changes are applied to image styles in feature styles in version 6.2.0.

## Cause of the Issue

The most likely cause is that the opacity value set via `setOpacity()` on an image style is not being properly applied to the rendered image in version 6.2.0. This could be due to:

1. A change in how opacity is processed in the rendering pipeline
2. A bug in the CSS opacity handling
3. An issue with how the style's opacity property is updated or accessed

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/style/Image.js
src/ol/style/Icon.js
src/ol/css.js
src/ol/render/canvas.js
src/ol/style/Style.js
```

The `src/ol/style/Image.js` file is most critical as it contains the base class for image styles with the `setOpacity` method. The `src/ol/style/Icon.js` extends this class and would be involved in rendering the image with opacity. The `src/ol/css.js` file contains the `cssOpacity` function which formats opacity values for CSS usage. The `src/ol/render/canvas.js` handles the actual rendering of styles on the canvas, and `src/ol/style/Style.js` manages the overall styling system.
