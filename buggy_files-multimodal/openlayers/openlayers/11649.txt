I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with broken projections when using proj4js definitions.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue occurs when using proj4js definitions with OpenLayers. Specifically:
- When adding a new projection definition via `proj4.defs()` and then registering it with `ol.proj.proj4.register(proj4)`, the resulting projection is invalid.
- The invalid projection is missing required parameters like `units` and has incorrect default values for `axisOrientation`.
- This causes the map display to be broken when using these projections.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The root cause appears to be in how OpenLayers processes proj4js definitions:
1. When a geographic CRS (coordinate reference system) is defined in proj4js, it often doesn't explicitly specify units.
2. OpenLayers fails to correctly infer that geographic projections should use "degrees" as the default unit when not specified.
3. Additionally, the axis orientation is not being correctly set - it defaults to 'enu' when it should be 'neu' for the given example.
4. These issues affect geographic projections specifically, as mentioned in the problem description.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information and the nature of the problem, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/ol/proj/proj4.js
src/ol/proj/Projection.js
src/ol/proj.js
src/ol/proj/projections.js
src/ol/proj/transforms.js
```

The issue is primarily in how OpenLayers integrates with proj4js and handles projection definitions. The `src/ol/proj/proj4.js` file is likely the most important as it handles the registration of proj4 definitions. The `Projection.js` file defines how projections are created and configured, while `proj.js` contains core projection functionality. The `projections.js` and `transforms.js` files handle the storage and transformation aspects of projections, which could be involved in the issue.
