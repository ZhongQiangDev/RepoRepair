I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with non-square pixels in COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) rendering.

## Analysis of the Problem

1. **Wrong Behavior**: Only the upper part of a COG is being shown when loaded, instead of displaying the complete image.

2. **Cause Analysis**: 
   This appears to be an issue with handling non-square pixels in GeoTIFF images. The problem occurs because the code is likely assuming square pixels (equal width and height) when calculating the extent or rendering the image. When a GeoTIFF has non-square pixels (different pixel width and height), this assumption causes incorrect rendering, showing only part of the image.

   The comparison with geotiff.io and QGIS (which display the image correctly) suggests that OpenLayers isn't properly handling the pixel aspect ratio or the transformation between pixel coordinates and geographic coordinates for this particular COG.

3. **Files Most Related to the Cause**:
   Based on the repository information, the following files are most likely involved in handling COG/GeoTIFF rendering and would need to be modified:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
src/ol/geom/flat/transform.js
src/ol/extent.js
```

The `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js` file is most critical as it directly handles GeoTIFF data and likely contains the code that incorrectly processes non-square pixels. The other files handle reprojection, transformation, and extent calculations which would be involved in properly displaying the complete image with the correct aspect ratio.
