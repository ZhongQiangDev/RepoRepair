I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

1. **Wrong Behavior**: Style expressions support fetching a feature property using `['get', 'attributeName']`, but there's no equivalent operator to access a feature's ID via `feature.getId()`.

2. **Cause**: The style expression system has a `get` operator for accessing properties from `feature.get('attributeName')`, but lacks an operator to access the feature's ID through `feature.getId()`. This forces users to duplicate the ID in both the root and properties collection of GeoJSON features.

3. **Required Solution**: Add a new expression operator (likely called `id`) that would allow accessing a feature's ID directly in style expressions, similar to how `get` works for properties.

## Files That Need to Be Modified

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to implement an ID reading operator:

```
src/ol/render/canvas/style.js
src/ol/style/expressions.js
src/ol/style/flat.js
test/spec/ol/style/expressions.test.js
src/ol/Feature.js
```

The first file contains style evaluation functions, the second likely contains the expression operators implementation, the third handles flat style objects, the fourth would need tests for the new operator, and the fifth contains the Feature class with the getId() method that we need to access.
