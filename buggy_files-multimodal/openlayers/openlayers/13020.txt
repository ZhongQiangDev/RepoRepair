I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that the `WebGLTile` Layer is missing a `setStyle` method, which would allow users to replace the visualization of a WebGL tile layer without completely removing and recreating the layer. Currently, there are setters for other visualization properties (variables and source), but not for the style itself.

This is problematic because without a `setStyle` method, users need to discard and recreate the entire layer when they want to change its visualization style, which means they lose the already downloaded raster data (like GeoTIFFs).

## Cause Analysis

Looking at the repository information, the `WebGLTile` layer class is defined in `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`. This class extends `BaseTileLayer` and has methods for updating style variables but lacks a method to completely replace the style.

The class has an `updateStyleVariables` method that allows updating variables within an existing style, but there's no equivalent method to replace the entire style object.

## Files That Need to Be Modified

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
examples/cog-colors.js
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` to add a `setStyle` method that would allow replacing the entire style configuration of a WebGL tile layer.

The `examples/cog-colors.js` file would be a good place to demonstrate the new functionality, as it already contains code for updating style variables of a layer, and could be extended to show how to completely replace a style.
