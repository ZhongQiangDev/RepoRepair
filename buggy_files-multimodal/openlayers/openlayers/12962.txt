I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the layer opacity stacking issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue occurs in OpenLayers version 6.8.1 and later (including 6.9.0), where layer opacity for independent layers (specifically tiled ArcGIS REST layers) doesn't work correctly. The top-most layer becomes opaque relative to other OpenLayers layers, even when opacity is set to a value less than 1. However, the opacity still works correctly relative to basemaps.

The problem only appears when multiple layers have identical opacity values (e.g., all set to 0.5). When layers have slightly different opacity values (e.g., 0.49, 0.50, 0.51), they render correctly with proper transparency.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the description, this appears to be a rendering issue in how OpenLayers handles layer opacity stacking when multiple layers have identical opacity values. The issue was introduced in version 6.8.1, suggesting a change in the rendering pipeline or compositing logic.

The problem likely involves how the canvas renderer applies opacity to layers during the rendering process. Since the issue only occurs with identical opacity values, there might be a comparison or sorting issue that treats layers with the same opacity differently than intended.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, these are the most likely files involved in the layer opacity rendering issue:

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/Layer.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/renderer/Map.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/renderer/canvas/Layer.js` - This is the base class for canvas-based layer renderers and handles core rendering operations including compositing and opacity.

2. `src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js` - This handles the specific rendering of tile layers (like the ArcGIS REST layers mentioned in the issue) and would be responsible for how tile opacity is applied.

3. `src/ol/layer/Base.js` - This contains the core layer functionality including opacity management and layer state handling.

4. `src/ol/renderer/Map.js` - This orchestrates the overall rendering process and layer ordering, which could affect how layers with identical opacity values are handled.

5. `src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js` - This handles image layer rendering which shares compositing logic with tile layers and might be involved in the opacity issue.
