I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that when using WebGL tile layers, if the source is replaced using `setSource()` or the view projection is changed, the cached tile textures are not properly invalidated. This causes incorrect textures to be displayed when panning or zooming back to previously viewed areas.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be in the WebGL tile rendering system. When a source is replaced or the projection changes, the cached textures from the previous source/projection are still being used instead of being cleared or regenerated. This suggests an issue with the cache invalidation mechanism in the WebGL tile layer implementation.

The key components involved would be:
- The WebGL tile layer renderer
- The tile cache management system
- The source change handling logic
- The projection change handling logic

## 3. Most Related Files

Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/layer/BaseTile.js
```

The `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` is likely the most critical file as it would contain the WebGL-specific rendering logic for tile layers, including texture caching. The `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` would define the WebGL tile layer class that manages the rendering process. The `src/ol/source/Tile.js` and `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` would handle the source management and change events. Finally, `src/ol/layer/BaseTile.js` would contain base functionality for tile layers that might be relevant to the issue.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves WebGL tile layers using incorrect cached textures when:
- A source is replaced using `setSource()`
- The view projection is changed

When users pan or zoom in, they see tiles from the correct new source or projection. However, when they pan back or zoom out, they see tiles from the old (incorrect) source or projection. This indicates that the cached textures are not being properly invalidated when the source or projection changes.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue appears to be related to texture caching in WebGL tile rendering. When a source is changed or projection is updated, the system correctly loads new tiles for areas that weren't previously visible, but it's failing to invalidate the cache for previously loaded tiles. This suggests a problem in:

1. The cache invalidation mechanism for WebGL textures
2. The handling of source changes or projection changes
3. The tile texture management system

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/structs/LRUCache.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/tilegrid/WMTS.js
src/ol/source/WMTS.js
```

The `webgl/TileTexture.js` file is most critical as it directly manages texture data for tiles in WebGL, handling loading and caching. The `LRUCache.js` file is likely responsible for the caching mechanism that's failing to invalidate old textures. The `tilegrid` files define how tiles are organized and accessed, which is relevant when projection changes. Finally, the `source/WMTS.js` file would be involved in handling source changes through the `setSource()` method mentioned in the bug report.
