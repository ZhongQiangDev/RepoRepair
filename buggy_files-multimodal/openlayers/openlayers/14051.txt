I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is with `layer.getMinZoom()` being used incorrectly in the WebGL TileLayer renderer. According to the description, this method returns a view zoom level which doesn't directly relate to tile grid zoom levels, but it's being used as a tile grid index. This could prevent tiles from loading properly, especially for sources with small tile grids that are part of a larger view.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is in `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` line 338, where `layer.getMinZoom()` is being used directly as a tile grid index. This is incorrect because:

1. `layer.getMinZoom()` returns a view zoom level, not a tile grid zoom level
2. These two zoom concepts are different and not directly interchangeable
3. The correct approach (as mentioned in the description) would be to either:
   - Remove the incorrect code, or
   - Replace it by calculating `tileGrid.getZForResolution()` from `layer.getMaxResolution()` or `view.getResolutionForZoom(layer.getMinZoom())`

## Files Most Related to the Cause

src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/layer/Layer.js

The primary file that needs to be edited is `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` since it contains the incorrect usage of `layer.getMinZoom()`.

The secondary file is `src/ol/layer/Layer.js` which contains the correct usage of `getMinZoom()` as referenced in the problem description (lines 415-423), showing how this method should be properly used in relation to `getMaxResolution()`.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is in `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` at line 338, where `layer.getMinZoom()` is being used directly as a tile grid index. This could prevent tiles from loading correctly, especially when a source with a small tile grid is part of a larger view. The correct approach would be to either:

## Files Most Related to the Cause
The main file that needs to be edited is the one mentioned in the problem description, but I'll also identify other relevant files that might be involved in this functionality:

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/source/XYZ.js
src/ol/source/Zoomify.js
```

The first file contains the actual bug. The second file shows the correct usage of `getMinZoom()`. The third file is important because it handles tile grid zoom levels and resolution calculations. The last two files are examples of tile sources that might be affected by this bug.
