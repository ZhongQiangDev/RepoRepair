I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves a mismatch between TileDebug coordinates and the actual coordinates used in TileImage requests. Specifically, when using the inverted Y coordinate format (`{-y}`) in a TileImage layer, the TileDebug layer doesn't properly represent this inversion, causing a discrepancy between what's shown in the debug layer and the actual network requests.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is that the TileDebug layer doesn't account for the inverted Y coordinate format (`{-y}`) that's being used in the TileImage layer. When the TileImage layer makes requests with inverted Y coordinates (e.g., `/service@EPSG_3857/{z}/{x}/{-y}.png`), the TileDebug layer still displays the non-inverted Y coordinates, causing confusion and making debugging difficult.

The TileDebug layer needs to be modified to recognize and display inverted Y coordinates when they're being used by the associated tile layers.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/source/TileDebug.js
src/ol/source/XYZ.js
src/ol/source/UrlTile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/tilecoord.js
```

These files are the most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/source/TileDebug.js` - This is the primary file that needs modification as it handles the rendering of tile coordinates for debugging purposes. It needs to be updated to properly display inverted Y coordinates.

2. `src/ol/source/XYZ.js` - This file handles XYZ tile sources, which is what's being used in the example with the `{-y}` format. It's responsible for interpreting the URL template.

3. `src/ol/source/UrlTile.js` - This is a base class for URL-based tile sources and handles the tile URL function creation.

4. `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` - This file extends UrlTile and is used for image-based tiles, which is what's being used in the example.

5. `src/ol/tilecoord.js` - This file contains utilities for handling tile coordinates, which would be relevant for properly displaying debug information.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves a mismatch between TileDebug coordinates and TileImage coordinates when using inverted Y coordinates (`{-y}`). Specifically:

1. The TileDebug layer shows tile coordinates in a standard format (x, y)
2. The TileImage layer is using an inverted Y coordinate format (`{-y}`) in its URL template
3. This causes a discrepancy between what's shown in the debug layer and the actual network requests

The problem is that when using the `{-y}` format in the TileImage URL template, the TileDebug layer doesn't account for this inversion, leading to confusing debugging information.

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause appears to be that the TileDebug layer doesn't recognize or handle the inverted Y coordinate format that's being used in the TileImage layer. When a tile grid uses inverted Y coordinates (common in some tile services), the debug layer should reflect this inversion to provide accurate debugging information.

## Most Relevant Files

```
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/tilegrid/WMTS.js
src/ol/source/TileDebug.js
src/ol/source/XYZ.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
```

The TileGrid.js file is most important as it handles the core tile coordinate calculations. WMTS.js is relevant as it extends TileGrid with specific functionality. The source files (TileDebug.js, XYZ.js, and TileImage.js) implement the specific layer types mentioned in the issue. The TileDebug source would need to be aware of the inverted Y coordinate system used by the TileImage source to properly display debug information.
