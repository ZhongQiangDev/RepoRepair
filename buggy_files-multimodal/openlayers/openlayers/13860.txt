I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

1. **Wrong Behavior**: The error message shows "Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length" when trying to load a GeoJSON source in OpenLayers v6.14.1, while the same GeoJSON works fine in Leaflet.

2. **Cause Analysis**: 
   - The error "Invalid array length" typically occurs when trying to create an array with a negative or extremely large length
   - This is happening during GeoJSON parsing in OpenLayers
   - The error is specific to OpenLayers and doesn't occur in Leaflet, suggesting it's related to how OpenLayers processes GeoJSON data
   - Looking at the screenshot of the GeoJSON in QGIS, it appears to be a valid GeoJSON file
   - The issue is likely in the GeoJSON parsing or handling code in OpenLayers

3. **Most Relevant Files**:
   Based on the repository information, the files most likely involved in GeoJSON handling and parsing are:

```
src/ol/format/GeoJSON.js
src/ol/source/Vector.js
src/ol/format/JSONFeature.js
src/ol/geom/flat/deflate.js
src/ol/geom/flat/inflate.js
```

The `src/ol/format/GeoJSON.js` file would be the primary file responsible for parsing GeoJSON data, while `src/ol/source/Vector.js` would handle loading the source from a URL. The `src/ol/format/JSONFeature.js` is a base class for JSON-based formats including GeoJSON. The geometry-related files would be involved in creating the actual geometry objects from the parsed GeoJSON data, which is where the array length error is likely occurring.
