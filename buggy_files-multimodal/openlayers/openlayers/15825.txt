I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue of missing tiles in WebGLTileLayer with a GeoTiff source.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue involves missing tiles in WebGLTileLayer when using a GeoTiff source and reprojecting to a stereographic projection. Specifically, there are black gaps near the antimeridian (180°/-180° longitude line), and the size of these gaps depends on the source tile size and zoom level.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

This appears to be an issue with how OpenLayers handles tile wrapping around the antimeridian when reprojecting from one coordinate system to another. When using a stereographic projection, tiles near the antimeridian are not being properly rendered, creating visible gaps.

The problem likely involves:
1. How tiles are requested and managed near the antimeridian
2. How the WebGLTileLayer handles reprojection of GeoTiff data
3. The handling of world wrapping in the stereographic projection

The issue is likely in the code that determines which tiles to render and how to handle the antimeridian crossing during reprojection.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayerBase.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/worldUtil.js
src/ol/tilegrid.js
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` - This is the WebGL renderer for tile layers, which would be responsible for rendering the WebGLTileLayer. It likely contains the core logic for determining which tiles to render and how to handle them in WebGL.

2. `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayerBase.js` - This contains base functionality for WebGL tile rendering, including functions for managing tile representations and calculating render extents.

3. `src/ol/renderer/webgl/worldUtil.js` - This file specifically handles world wrapping calculations for WebGL rendering, which is directly related to the antimeridian issue.

4. `src/ol/tilegrid.js` - This file contains functions for handling tile coordinates, including the `wrapX` function which is critical for handling tiles that cross the antimeridian.

5. `src/ol/reproj/Tile.js` - This handles the reprojection of tiles between different coordinate systems, which is exactly what's happening when reprojecting GeoTiff tiles to a stereographic projection.

The issue is likely in how these components interact when handling tiles near the antimeridian during reprojection to a stereographic projection.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the missing tiles issue around the antimeridian in a stereographic projection.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue involves missing tiles (black gaps) when using WebGLTileLayer with a GeoTiff source after reprojecting into a stereographic projection. The gaps appear specifically near the antimeridian (180°/-180° longitude line).

## Analyzing the Cause
This is likely a projection handling issue. When reprojecting GeoTiff tiles into a stereographic projection, tiles that cross or are near the antimeridian aren't being properly rendered. The issue is probably in how the tile coordinates are calculated or how the extent is handled during reprojection, especially for tiles that span the antimeridian boundary.

In map projections, the antimeridian requires special handling because it represents the "wrap-around" point of the map. In a stereographic projection (which is used for polar regions), this becomes particularly challenging because the projection significantly distorts areas near the edges of the visible hemisphere.

## Most Related Files

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most likely files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
```

The reasoning for this selection:

1. `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js` - This is the primary file handling GeoTIFF sources, which is directly mentioned in the bug report. It likely contains the code that determines how GeoTIFF data is processed and converted into tiles.

2. `src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js` - This file handles tile grid calculations, including methods like `getTileCoordExtent` and `getTileRangeForExtentAndZ` which are critical for determining which tiles to render for a given extent. The antimeridian issue is likely related to how these calculations handle the wrap-around at 180°/-180°.

3. `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js` - This file manages WebGL textures for tiles, which is directly relevant to the WebGLTileLayer mentioned in the bug report. It handles how tile data is uploaded to the GPU for rendering.

4. `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` - This file contains core functionality for handling tile images, including reprojection logic. The issue might be in how it handles tiles that cross projection boundaries.

5. `src/ol/source/DataTile.js` - This file is the base class for data tile sources, which GeoTIFF extends. It contains fundamental tile handling logic that might need adjustment for proper antimeridian handling.
