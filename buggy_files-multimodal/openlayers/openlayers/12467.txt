I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the jitter issue in circle animations.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves visible jitter in circle animations after upgrading from OpenLayers 4.6.5 to 6.5. This jitter is most noticeable at the end of animations when the circle's diameter is largest. In the previous version, setting `snapToPixel: false` for `ol.style.Circle` prevented this jitter, but this parameter was removed in version 5.2.0.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The cause appears to be related to how OpenLayers handles pixel snapping during animations. According to the upgrade notes, the renderer should automatically:
- Snap to integer pixels when no interaction or animation is running (for crisp rendering)
- Not snap to integer pixels during interaction or animation (to avoid jitter)

However, the observed behavior suggests this automatic handling isn't working correctly for circle animations in version 6.5, causing the visible jitter.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/style/Circle.js
src/ol/View.js
src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js
```

The `src/ol/style/Circle.js` file is most critical as it directly handles the circle styling and previously contained the `snapToPixel` option that was removed. The issue likely requires modifying how circle rendering handles pixel snapping during animations.

`src/ol/View.js` is important because it manages animations and the "animating" state that should control when pixel snapping occurs.

`src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js` handles the execution of rendering instructions and would be involved in the actual drawing of circles with proper pixel positioning.

`src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js` and `src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js` are also relevant as they contain rendering logic that might influence how circles are drawn during animations.
