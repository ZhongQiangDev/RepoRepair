I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem occurs when a WebGLTileLayer with a palette style is removed from the map and then added back. After this operation, the layer appears black instead of displaying properly. The console shows WebGL errors like:
- `WebGL warning: bindTexture: 'tex' is from a different (or lost) WebGL context.`
- `WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: bindTexture: object does not belong to this context`

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

This issue appears to be related to WebGL texture management. When a WebGLTileLayer with a palette style is removed from the map, its WebGL textures (particularly the palette texture) are not being properly cleaned up or recreated when the layer is added back. 

The palette texture is likely still referencing a WebGL context that has been destroyed or is no longer valid. When the layer is added back to the map, it tries to use this invalid texture reference, resulting in WebGL errors and a black layer.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information and the nature of the problem, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/webgl/PaletteTexture.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
```

The `PaletteTexture.js` file is likely the most critical since it directly manages the palette textures that are causing the issue. The `WebGLTile.js` file defines the layer class that's experiencing the problem. The `TileLayer.js` renderer handles the actual WebGL rendering of the tile layer. `TileTexture.js` manages the tile textures, which might interact with the palette textures. Finally, `webgl/Helper.js` provides WebGL context management that could be related to the context loss issue.
