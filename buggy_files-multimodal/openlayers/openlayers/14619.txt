I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with cloned icons having the wrong scale value.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem occurs when an Icon's scale is set as a number and then cloned. The clone incorrectly has an array with different values as its scale, rather than maintaining the original number value.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the description, this happens because:
1. When setting the scale as a number using `setScale()`, the Icon internally receives both height and width values.
2. When cloning the Icon, the constructor is called, which converts these internal height/width values into an array scale.
3. This conflicts with the documentation which states that height and width can't be used with scale.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Looking at the repository information, I need to find files related to Icon handling, cloning, and scale properties. The most relevant files would be:

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
src/ol/style/Image.js
src/ol/style/Style.js
```

These files are most likely to contain the code related to Icon styling, scale handling, and the clone functionality that's causing the issue. The Icon class would extend the Image class, and both would be part of the Style system in OpenLayers.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue described is that when an Icon's scale is set as a number and then cloned, the scale of the clone becomes an array with different values instead of maintaining the original number value. This happens because:

1. When setting the scale via `setScale()`, an Icon internally receives both height and width values
2. During cloning, the constructor is called, which sets the scale to an array even though it was originally a number
3. The documentation states that height and width can't be used with scale, indicating a conflict in the implementation

This is a bug in the cloning mechanism of the Icon class, where the scale property type is not preserved during the cloning process.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
src/ol/style/Image.js
src/ol/style/Style.js
src/ol/style/IconImage.js
src/ol/style/RegularShape.js
```

The primary issue is likely in the `Icon.js` file which would contain the cloning logic for icons. The `Image.js` file is important as it's probably the parent class that `Icon` extends from, containing base functionality for image-based styles. The `Style.js` file would be involved in the overall style management including cloning operations. `IconImage.js` likely handles the underlying image representation, and `RegularShape.js` might contain related functionality that affects how scale is handled in image-based styles.
