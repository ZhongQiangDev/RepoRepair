I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The GitHub issue (#799) is about fixing image+label combinations when the `declutterMode` is different than 'declutter'. The description also mentions adding a boolean `ignorePlacement` option to `ol.style.Image` and `ol.style.Text`.

The problem appears to be related to how OpenLayers handles decluttering (the process of preventing overlapping labels and icons on a map). When `declutterMode` is set to something other than 'declutter', there seems to be an issue with how image and label combinations are rendered.

The issue likely involves how the rendering system decides which elements to declutter and which to always show, particularly when both images (icons) and text labels are present for the same feature.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/style/Image.js
src/ol/style/Icon.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js
```

The reasoning for selecting these files:

1. `src/ol/style/Image.js` - This is the base class for image styles in OpenLayers. The issue mentions adding a boolean `ignorePlacement` option to this class, which would affect how images are handled during decluttering.

2. `src/ol/style/Icon.js` - This extends the Image class and would need to implement or handle the new `ignorePlacement` option. Icons are commonly used with labels, so this is directly related to the image+label combination issue.

3. `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js` - This class handles the actual rendering of features, including decluttering logic. It contains methods for processing declutter items and would need to be modified to respect the new `ignorePlacement` option.

4. `src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js` - This class manages groups of executors and handles decluttering at a higher level. It would need to be updated to properly handle the different declutter modes and the new option.

5. `src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js` - This file handles hit detection for rendered features, which may need to be updated to properly work with the modified decluttering behavior.
