I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that `WebGLPointsLayer` doesn't work correctly with `useGeographic()`. When `useGeographic()` is enabled, the points from `WebGLPointsLayer` are plotted at incorrect locations (near Africa), while regular `VectorLayer` works fine with `useGeographic()`.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue appears to be that `WebGLPointsLayer` doesn't properly respect the feature projection (EPSG:4326) specified at the Vector source when `useGeographic()` is enabled. Instead, it seems to be creating features with geometry in EPSG:3857 projection.

This suggests that there's a problem in how the WebGL points renderer handles coordinate transformations when the map is using geographic coordinates. The `useGeographic()` function sets the user projection to WGS-84 (EPSG:4326), but the WebGL points layer isn't properly accounting for this when rendering.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js
src/ol/proj.js
src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
```

The `src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js` is likely the most important file as it contains the WebGL renderer for points layers, which would be responsible for transforming coordinates during rendering. 

The `src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js` defines the WebGLPointsLayer class that's mentioned in the bug report.

The `src/ol/proj.js` contains the `useGeographic()` function mentioned in the bug report and handles projection transformations.

The `src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js` and `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js` define the two projections involved in this issue (WGS-84 geographic coordinates and Web Mercator).
