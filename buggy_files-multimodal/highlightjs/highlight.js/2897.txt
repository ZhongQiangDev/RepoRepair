I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem shows that when an empty block comment (`/**/`) appears in JavaScript code, it breaks syntax highlighting for the rest of the code. In the example, `console.log("Hello, World!")` should be highlighted properly, but it's not.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue appears to be in the JavaScript language syntax highlighting definition. Empty block comments (`/**/`) are not being properly handled, causing the highlighter to fail for subsequent code. This is likely because the regular expression or logic that handles block comments doesn't properly account for empty comments.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/languages/javascript.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/highlight.js
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `src/languages/javascript.js` since it contains the JavaScript language definition and would handle how comments are processed. The issue is specifically with JavaScript block comments, so this is the most important file to fix.

The `src/lib/modes.js` file is also relevant as it contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting modes, including the `COMMENT` function which likely handles comment highlighting.

Finally, `src/highlight.js` contains the core highlighting logic and might need adjustments if the issue is related to how the highlighter processes language definitions.
