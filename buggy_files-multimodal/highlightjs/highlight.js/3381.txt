I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that in Python code, part of an identifier `_undef` is being incorrectly highlighted as a keyword. Specifically, the `def` portion is being highlighted as if it were the Python `def` keyword, even though it's part of a variable name.

From the HTML output provided in the issue:
```html
<code class="python lang-python hljs language-python">foo = _un<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span>
</code>
```

We can see that:
1. The identifier `_undef` is split into `_un` and `def`
2. The `def` part is wrapped in a span with class `hljs-keyword`
3. This issue started in version 11.0.0 and doesn't exist in 10.7.3

The problem appears to be in the Python language definition for Highlight.js, where it's incorrectly identifying `def` as a keyword even when it's part of an identifier.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/python.js
src/lib/regex.js
src/highlight.js
```

The `python.js` file is the most important because it contains the language definition for Python, including how keywords are identified and highlighted. The issue is likely in how the regex patterns for Python keywords (particularly `def`) are defined.

The `regex.js` file is relevant because it provides utility functions for creating and manipulating regular expressions, which are used in language definitions to match syntax patterns.

The `highlight.js` file is the core of the library that processes the language definitions and applies the highlighting, so it may be involved in how keyword matching is handled.
