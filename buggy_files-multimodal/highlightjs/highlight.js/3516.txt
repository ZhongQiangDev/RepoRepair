I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is with CSS syntax highlighting where a string within parentheses is not being properly highlighted. Specifically, when a filename contains parentheses (like "background (01).jpg"), the closing parenthesis in the filename is incorrectly being treated as the closing parenthesis for the URL function, rather than respecting the string delimiters (' or ").

## Analyzing the Cause
The problem appears to be in the CSS language syntax highlighting rules. The highlighter is prioritizing matching parentheses over respecting string boundaries. When it encounters a closing parenthesis within a string that's inside a URL function, it's treating that as the end of the URL function rather than continuing to respect the string delimiters.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/languages/css.js
src/highlight.js
```

The `src/languages/css.js` file is the primary file that needs to be modified as it contains the syntax highlighting rules specific to CSS. This is where the rules for handling strings, functions like `url()`, and parentheses in CSS would be defined.

The `src/highlight.js` file might also need to be checked as it contains the core highlighting logic that processes the language-specific rules, but the main issue is likely in the CSS language definition.
