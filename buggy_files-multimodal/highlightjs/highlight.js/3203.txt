I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with PowerShell flag highlighting.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in PowerShell syntax highlighting, double-hyphen flags (`--flag`) are not being highlighted correctly, while single-hyphen flags (`-flag`) are highlighted properly. According to the user's screenshots, PowerShell Core 7.1.3 highlights both types of flags, so this is expected behavior that should be implemented.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The problem is likely in the PowerShell language definition for Highlight.js. The current implementation probably only recognizes single-hyphen flags (`-flag`) as valid PowerShell parameters, but doesn't properly handle double-hyphen flags (`--flag`), which are also valid in PowerShell.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
After reviewing the repository information, here are the files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/languages/powershell.js
```

This is the only file that needs to be modified. The PowerShell language definition in `src/languages/powershell.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for PowerShell scripts. The issue is specifically with how parameter flags are defined and recognized in this file.

The problem is likely in the regular expression patterns that identify PowerShell parameters/flags. The current implementation probably only matches single-hyphen parameters but needs to be updated to also match double-hyphen parameters.
