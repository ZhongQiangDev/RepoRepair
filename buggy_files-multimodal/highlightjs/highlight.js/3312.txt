I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in C++, the `switch` statement is not highlighted correctly starting from hljs 10.7.0, while other control statements like `if`, `while`, and `for` are highlighted properly. This is a regression from version 10.6.0.

## Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the screenshots provided:
- Expected behavior: The `switch` keyword should be highlighted the same way as other control flow statements like `if`, `while`, and `for`.
- Actual behavior: The `switch` keyword is not highlighted or is highlighted differently.

This suggests that there's an issue with how the `switch` keyword is categorized in the C++ language definition. It's likely that `switch` was either:
1. Removed from the list of keywords
2. Moved to a different category of keywords that doesn't receive the same highlighting
3. There's a pattern matching issue specific to the `switch` keyword

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Since this is specifically a C++ highlighting issue that appeared between versions 10.6.0 and 10.7.0, the most relevant files would be:

```
src/languages/cpp.js
src/languages/c-like.js
src/languages/c.js
```

The issue is most likely in `src/languages/cpp.js` since that's the primary file for C++ syntax highlighting. However, C++ highlighting might inherit from C-like language definitions, so `src/languages/c-like.js` is also important. Additionally, since C++ often inherits from C, the `src/languages/c.js` file could also be relevant.

The problem is specifically with the `switch` statement highlighting, which would be defined in the keyword lists or syntax patterns in these files.
