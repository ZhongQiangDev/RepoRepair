I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with the LL suffix highlighting in C/C++.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that when the `LL` integer literal suffix is used in C/C++ code (e.g., `1LL` for a long long integer), only the first `L` is being highlighted. Both `L`s should be highlighted as they form a single token in C/C++.

## Analyzing the Cause
The problem is likely in the regular expression patterns used to identify number literals in C/C++ syntax highlighting. The current pattern probably recognizes only a single `L` as a valid suffix for integer literals, rather than recognizing that `LL` is a valid suffix for long long integers.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Looking at the repository information, the most relevant files would be those that define syntax highlighting for C and C++:

```
src/languages/c-like.js
src/languages/c.js
src/languages/cpp.js
```

The `c-like.js` file is likely the most important since it probably contains the base definitions for C-like languages, including the number literal patterns. Both C and C++ would inherit these patterns, which is why both languages show the same issue. The `c.js` and `cpp.js` files would extend or customize the base definitions from `c-like.js`.

The issue is specifically with how number literals with the `LL` suffix are being recognized and highlighted, so the fix would involve modifying the regular expression pattern for number literals to properly recognize and highlight both `L`s in the `LL` suffix.
