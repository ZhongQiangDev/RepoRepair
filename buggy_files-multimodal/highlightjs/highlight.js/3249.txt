I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that LaTeX magic comments with "TEX" (uppercase "E") are not being highlighted, while those with "TeX" (lowercase "e") are. According to the problem description, these magic comments should be case insensitive, meaning both formats should be highlighted.

## Analyzing the Cause
The problem is in the LaTeX language definition file. The issue points to a specific line in the code:
https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/2dd87a6ef58c8c886dd209076aa6661ffae89577/src/languages/latex.js#L106-L111

This suggests that the `MAGIC_COMMENT` rule in the LaTeX language definition is using a case-sensitive pattern to match "TeX" in magic comments, rather than a case-insensitive one.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information and the problem description, the most important file to edit is:

```
src/languages/latex.js
```

This is the only file that needs to be modified to fix the issue. The problem is specifically in the `MAGIC_COMMENT` rule definition in this file, which needs to be updated to make the "TeX" pattern case-insensitive.
