I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that in JavaScript and TypeScript syntax highlighting, right curly braces (`}`) inside template literal expressions are causing the highlighter to incorrectly think the expression has ended. This leads to incorrect highlighting where:
- Text after a right curly brace inside a template expression is highlighted as a string
- If there's a nested template literal after the right curly brace, it's treated as the terminator for the parent template literal

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be in the regex pattern or parsing logic that handles template literals in JavaScript/TypeScript. The highlighter is not properly tracking nested curly braces within template literal expressions (the `${}` parts). When it encounters a closing curly brace, it's prematurely ending the expression highlighting, even if that brace is part of an object literal or other nested structure.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/languages/javascript.js
src/languages/typescript.js
src/lib/modes.js
```

The issue is primarily in the JavaScript language definition, which likely defines how template literals are parsed and highlighted. The TypeScript language definition inherits from or extends the JavaScript one, so it's also affected. The `modes.js` file might contain utility functions for handling nested expressions that could be relevant to fixing this issue.
