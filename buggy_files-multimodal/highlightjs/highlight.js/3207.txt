I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with Elixir function capture syntax highlighting.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue occurs when highlighting Elixir code that includes function captures (`&function_name/arity`). The syntax highlighting breaks after the `/` character in the function capture syntax, treating it as something else until the next `/` appears in the code. This causes incorrect highlighting of code that follows the function capture.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be in the Elixir language definition for Highlight.js. The `/` character in the function capture syntax (`&letter?/1`) is likely being interpreted as a regex delimiter rather than part of the Elixir function capture syntax. This causes the highlighting to break until another `/` is encountered.

The issue is specifically with how the Elixir language mode handles the function capture operator (`&`) followed by a function name and the arity specifier (`/number`).

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/elixir.js
src/highlight.js
```

The `src/languages/elixir.js` file is the most important one to fix, as it contains the language definition for Elixir, including how function captures should be highlighted. This is where the regex patterns or rules for handling the `/` character in function captures need to be modified.

The `src/highlight.js` file is the core of the library and might be relevant if there are any general issues with how regex patterns are processed, but the primary fix would be in the Elixir language definition.
