I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with zero not being highlighted as a number in Elixir.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that in Elixir syntax highlighting:
- `0` on its own is not highlighted as a number
- Numbers starting with `0` (like `0123`) are not highlighted at all
- In floating-point numbers starting with `0` (like `0.3`), only the part after the decimal point is highlighted

This is inconsistent with Elixir's syntax, where all of these should be valid numbers and should be fully highlighted.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is likely in the regular expression pattern used to identify numbers in the Elixir language definition for Highlight.js. The current pattern probably doesn't properly account for numbers that start with `0`, either treating them differently or not recognizing them as valid numbers at all.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/elixir.js
src/lib/regex.js
src/highlight.js
```

The most important file is `src/languages/elixir.js` because it would contain the language-specific syntax highlighting rules for Elixir, including the pattern for recognizing numbers. This is where the fix would need to be made.

The `src/lib/regex.js` file is relevant as a secondary file because it contains utility functions for working with regular expressions, which might be used in the Elixir language definition.

The `src/highlight.js` file is included as it's the core module that manages the highlighting process, but the issue is most likely specific to the Elixir language definition rather than the core highlighting logic.
