I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in Python code, when a number is directly followed by a keyword (without a space), the syntax highlighter is not correctly separating them. For example, in `1if 0==0else"b"`, the `1if` is being treated as a single token instead of being separated into `1` and `if`.

## Analyzing the Cause
In Python, keywords cannot start with numbers, but it's valid syntax to have a number directly followed by a keyword (without a space). The syntax highlighter should recognize this pattern and highlight the number and keyword separately, as shown in the expected output image.

The issue is likely in the Python language definition for Highlight.js, where the tokenization rules aren't properly handling this edge case of a number directly followed by a keyword.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/python.js
src/highlight.js
```

The `src/languages/python.js` file is the most important because it contains the language definition for Python, including the tokenization rules that determine how Python code is parsed and highlighted. This is where the fix needs to be implemented to correctly handle numbers followed directly by keywords.

The `src/highlight.js` file is the core module that handles the highlighting logic and might need to be considered if the issue requires changes to the core highlighting mechanism rather than just the Python-specific rules.
