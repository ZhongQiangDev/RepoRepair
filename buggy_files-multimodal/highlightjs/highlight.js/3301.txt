I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that inline comments in CSS are not being highlighted correctly in highlight.js version 10.6.0 and later (using the new `highlightAll` API). This is a regression from version 10.5.0 which correctly highlighted CSS comments.

Looking at the screenshots:
- Expected behavior: CSS comments (like `/* comment */`) should be highlighted in a distinct color
- Actual behavior: CSS comments are not being highlighted and appear in the same color as regular code

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue appears to be related to:
1. A regression between versions 10.5.0 and 10.6.0
2. Specifically affects CSS language highlighting
3. Only occurs when using the new `highlightAll` API (which replaced `initHighlighting`)

This suggests that either:
- The CSS language definition has a bug in how it defines comment highlighting
- The new `highlightAll` API has a bug in how it processes comments for CSS
- There's an integration issue between the CSS language module and the core highlighting engine

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/languages/css.js
src/highlight.js
src/languages/lib/css-shared.js
src/lib/modes.js
types/index.d.ts
```

The `src/languages/css.js` file is most critical as it defines the CSS language syntax highlighting rules, including how comments should be handled. The issue is likely in this file since the problem is specific to CSS comments.

The `src/highlight.js` file contains the core functionality including the `highlightAll` API that was introduced in version 10.6.0, which is when the regression occurred.

The `src/languages/lib/css-shared.js` file contains shared CSS highlighting modes that might include comment handling logic.

The `src/lib/modes.js` file includes the `COMMENT` function which is likely used by the CSS language definition to handle comments.

The `types/index.d.ts` file might be relevant for understanding the type definitions and interfaces that could affect how comments are processed.
