I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The issue is that users can select days from the previous month that are outside the specified bounds in the DateInput calendar. In the example, the bounds are set to `['2020-07-01', '2020-07-31']`, but users can still select days from June (the previous month) that appear in the calendar view.

## Analyzing the Cause

This is likely happening because:
1. The Calendar component shows days from adjacent months to fill out the grid
2. The bounds validation is not properly checking these adjacent days
3. The DateInput component is not correctly passing or handling the bounds for these adjacent days

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js
src/js/components/DateInput/DateInput.js
src/js/components/DateInput/utils.js
src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js
src/js/components/Calendar/stories/ShowAdjacentDays.js
```

The main issue is likely in the Calendar component, which handles day selection and bounds validation. The DateInput component passes the bounds to the Calendar, and the DateInput's utility functions handle date comparisons and validations. The StyledCalendar file might contain styling that affects how disabled dates appear. The ShowAdjacentDays story demonstrates how adjacent days are displayed, which is directly related to this issue.
