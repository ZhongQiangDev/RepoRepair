I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that the arrow icon for a Select component is not visible when used on a dark background, as shown in the screenshot. The arrow that should indicate the dropdown functionality is not visible to users.

## Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the screenshot, this appears to be a contrast issue. The arrow icon is likely being rendered with a color that doesn't have enough contrast against the dark background. This is probably happening because:

1. The Select component uses an icon for the dropdown indicator
2. The icon's color isn't being properly adjusted based on the background color
3. The component might not be properly detecting the dark background or applying the appropriate color scheme

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/js/components/Select/Select.js
src/js/components/Box/Box.js
src/js/components/Button/Button.js
src/js/components/Button/StyledButton.js
src/js/components/Anchor/StyledAnchor.js
```

The primary issue is likely in the Select component, which renders the dropdown with the arrow. The Box component is important because it handles background detection and theme context propagation. The Button and Anchor components are relevant because they likely handle icon coloring in similar ways, and the Select component probably uses one of these internally for the dropdown trigger.
