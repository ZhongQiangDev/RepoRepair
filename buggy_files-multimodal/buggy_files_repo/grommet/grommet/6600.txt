I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is with the `DataFilters` component which currently has a `drop` prop that enables dropdown menu selection. When there are many filters, the dropdown menu overflows and becomes difficult to use, as shown in the screenshot.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The component needs a new `layer` prop that would allow filters to be displayed in a separate layer with more space, rather than being constrained to a dropdown menu. This would provide a better user experience when dealing with many filters.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to implement the `layer` prop for the `DataFilters` component:

```
src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js
src/js/components/DataFilters/index.d.ts
src/js/components/DataFilters/stories/Layer.js
src/js/components/Layer/Layer.js
src/js/components/Drop/DropContainer.js
```

Note: Since the actual `DataFilters` component files weren't included in the repository information provided, I've made an educated guess about their existence and naming based on the problem description and common patterns in the codebase. The implementation would likely require:

1. Adding the `layer` prop to the `DataFilters` component
2. Updating the TypeScript definitions
3. Creating a story example for the layer functionality
4. Potentially modifying the Layer and Drop components to support this new interaction pattern
