I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the color contrast violation.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is a color contrast violation in the Form/AggregateValidation component. The screenshot shows an error message in red text that likely doesn't have sufficient contrast against its background, violating accessibility standards. The problem description specifically mentions that `color="status-error"` needs an update.

## Analyzing the Cause
The cause appears to be insufficient color contrast between the error text (using the `status-error` color) and its background. This is an accessibility issue as text with poor contrast is difficult to read for users with visual impairments. The WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) requires a minimum contrast ratio between text and background.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/Form/stories/AggregateValidation.js
src/js/themes/base.js
src/js/utils/colors.js
src/js/components/Text/stories/All.js
src/js/components/Text/index.d.ts
```

The `AggregateValidation.js` file is the most important as it likely contains the component with the contrast violation, showing the error message with `color="status-error"`. 

The `base.js` theme file would define the actual color values for status colors including `status-error`.

The `colors.js` utility file contains functions for color manipulation and contrast checking.

The `Text` component files are relevant because they handle how text colors are applied and rendered, which is directly related to the contrast issue.
