I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that the `Meter` component with `type="circle"` is not rendering all data points correctly. It only renders the last data point instead of all of them. This behavior was working correctly in v2.24.0 but broke in v2.25.0.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the description and the example code, the issue appears to be in the circular meter rendering logic. The component is receiving an array of values but only displaying the last one. This suggests a regression in how the Circle component processes the `values` array.

Looking at the repository information, the most likely culprit would be in the `Meter` component's implementation, specifically in the files that handle the circle type rendering.

## Most Related Files

```
src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js
src/js/components/Meter/utils.js
src/js/utils/graphics.js
src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js
```

The `Circle.js` file is most likely the primary source of the issue since it's responsible for rendering the circular meter and processing the values array. The bug is probably in how it iterates through or renders the multiple segments from the values array.

The `Meter.js` file is the main component that determines which type of meter to render, and it passes the values to the Circle component.

The `utils.js` file contains helper functions for the Meter component, which might be involved in processing the values.

The `graphics.js` utility file contains functions for drawing SVG paths and arcs, which are essential for rendering the circle meter segments.

The `StyledMeter.js` file contains styling logic that could potentially affect how the segments are displayed.
