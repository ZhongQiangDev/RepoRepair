I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with the RangeInput being off-center within FormField.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that the RangeInput extends beyond the edge of the FormField and is not centered. This is visible in the screenshot provided, where the range slider appears to be misaligned within its container.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the description and screenshot, this appears to be a styling/layout issue where:
1. The RangeInput component's width or positioning is not properly aligned with its FormField container
2. The RangeInput might have incorrect margin or padding values
3. There could be issues with how the RangeInput is styled within the FormField context

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/js/components/RangeInput/StyledRangeInput.js
src/js/components/RangeInput/RangeInput.js
src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js
src/js/utils/styles.js
src/js/components/FormField/index.d.ts
```

The `StyledRangeInput.js` file is most critical as it contains the styling functions for the RangeInput component, including track color styles, padding styles, and other layout-related styling. The issue is likely in how these styles are applied, particularly with margins or alignment.

The `RangeInput.js` file contains the component implementation which might need adjustments in how it renders within a FormField.

The `FormField.js` file handles how form elements are contained and styled within the field, which could be affecting the RangeInput's positioning.

The `styles.js` utility file contains helper functions for styling that might be relevant to fixing alignment issues.

The `FormField/index.d.ts` file might need updates if the fix requires changes to the component's TypeScript definitions.
