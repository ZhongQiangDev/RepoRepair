I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when using a Box component with both `border="between"` and a gap size specified in pixels (e.g., `gap="10px"`). This combination causes a runtime error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')
```

This suggests that somewhere in the code, there's an attempt to call the `match()` method on a value that is `undefined`. Since the error occurs specifically when using `border="between"` with a pixel-based gap, the issue is likely in the code that handles the interaction between borders and gaps.

## Cause of the Issue

The error message indicates that the code is trying to use a string method (`match`) on an undefined value. This typically happens when:

1. The code expects a string value but receives `undefined`
2. The code tries to extract information from the string using regex matching
3. The specific combination of `border="between"` and `gap="10px"` triggers this condition

Looking at the repository information, the issue is likely in the Box component's styling logic, particularly in how it handles borders and gaps together.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js
src/js/utils/border.js
src/js/components/Box/Box.js
src/js/utils/styles.js
src/js/utils/mixins.js
```

The most important file is likely `src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js` as it contains the styling logic for the Box component, including handling of borders and gaps. The error is most likely occurring in this file when processing the gap and border properties.

The `border.js` utility file is the second most important as it contains the border styling functions that would be used when `border="between"` is specified.

The `Box.js` component file would be the third most important as it's the main component file that passes props to the styled components.

The `styles.js` and `mixins.js` utility files contain supporting functions that might be involved in processing the gap property and converting pixel values.
