I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

### Wrong Behavior
The 'Clear Filters' button is missing when users interact with Data Toolbar components (Filter, Search, etc.). According to the design system examples, this button should appear whenever a user interacts with these components.

### Cause Analysis
Based on the problem description and screenshots, the issue appears to be that the 'Clear Filters' control has been implemented as a top-level component instead of being embedded within the Data component. This means it's not automatically appearing when filters are applied.

The problem is likely in the Data component implementation, where the 'Clear Filters' functionality should be integrated to appear whenever filters are active. The component should detect when filters are applied and conditionally render the 'Clear Filters' button.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/js/components/Data/Data.js
src/js/components/DataForm/DataForm.js
src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js
src/js/components/DataSearch/DataSearch.js
src/js/components/DataFilter/DataFilter.js
```

The `Data.js` file is the most critical as it's the main component that should be managing the 'Clear Filters' functionality. The `DataForm.js` file likely handles form state including when filters are applied. The `DataFilters.js`, `DataSearch.js`, and `DataFilter.js` files are the components that trigger filtering actions and should be connected to the 'Clear Filters' functionality.
