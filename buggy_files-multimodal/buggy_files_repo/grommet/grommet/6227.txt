I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The issue involves a form validation problem when dynamically adding and removing required fields:

1. When a checkbox is unselected, a new required TextInput field appears, making the form invalid (expected behavior)
2. When the checkbox is toggled back, the TextInput is removed from the DOM, but the form still reports as invalid (unexpected behavior)
3. The expected behavior is that when the field is removed, the form should become valid again (assuming all other validations pass)

This is a bug in form validation where the form is not properly re-evaluating its validity state when required fields are dynamically removed.

## Analyzing the Cause

The root cause appears to be that when a required field is dynamically removed from the form, its validation state is not being properly cleared from the form's internal validation tracking. The form continues to consider the removed field as invalid, even though it no longer exists in the DOM.

Based on the repository information, this is likely happening in the Form component's validation logic, which needs to properly handle the case when fields are dynamically added or removed.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/Form/Form.js
src/js/components/Form/FormContext.js
src/js/components/CheckBox/CheckBox.js
src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js
src/js/components/Form/stories/DynamicFields.js
```

The `Form.js` file is most critical as it likely contains the validation logic that needs to be updated to handle dynamic fields properly. The `FormContext.js` file is important because it probably manages the form state and field registration/deregistration. The `CheckBox.js` file is relevant since the issue involves toggling fields with a checkbox. The `FormField.js` file would handle individual field validation, and the `DynamicFields.js` story demonstrates a similar use case to the reported issue.
