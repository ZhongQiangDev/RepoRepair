I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue involves a strange animation on the path of a circle Meter component. According to the description:
- There's a "transition all" of 300ms on the path of the SVG
- This produces a weird animation in Chrome (as shown in the GIF)
- No animation at all in latest Firefox and Safari
- The issue occurs when changing the value of a circle Meter

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the description and the GIF, the issue appears to be related to how transitions are applied to SVG paths in the circle Meter component. The "transition all" property is causing an unintended animation effect when the value changes. This is likely because:

1. The SVG path for the circle is being redrawn when the value changes
2. A CSS transition is being applied to all properties of the path
3. This causes Chrome to animate between the old and new path shapes in a visually strange way
4. Firefox and Safari handle this differently, resulting in no animation

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js
src/js/components/Meter/meter.stories.js
src/js/utils/graphics.js
src/js/components/Meter/utils.js
```

The `Circle.js` file is most important as it likely contains the core implementation of the circle Meter component where the SVG paths are generated and rendered. The `StyledMeter.js` file would contain the styling including transitions that are causing the issue. The `meter.stories.js` file contains storybook stories for the meter components. The `graphics.js` utility file contains functions for generating SVG paths, and `utils.js` contains meter-specific utilities that might be involved in the rendering process.
