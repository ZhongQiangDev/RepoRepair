Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- VoiceOver (screen reader) does not announce the On/Off labels for the toggle component when using keyboard navigation
- The issue appears to be caused by `aria-hidden="true"` being added to the toggle component, which prevents screen readers from accessing the labels

2. Cause Analysis:
- The toggle component's accessibility is being blocked by `aria-hidden="true"` attribute
- This attribute was recently added and prevents screen readers from reading the On/Off labels
- When `aria-hidden` is removed, the labels are read correctly
- This suggests an issue with the accessibility configuration in the toggle component implementation

3. Most Related Files:
The following files are most relevant to fixing this accessibility issue, ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js
packages/react/src/components/ToggleSmall/ToggleSmall.js
packages/globals/js/misc/on-focus-by-keyboard.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js
```

Reasoning:
- `Toggle.js` is the main component implementation where the aria attributes need to be fixed
- `Toggle-test.js` contains tests that should verify accessibility behavior
- `ToggleSmall.js` may share similar accessibility issues as it's a variant of Toggle
- `on-focus-by-keyboard.js` handles keyboard focus behavior which is relevant to screen reader interaction
- `Toggle-story.js` contains examples/documentation that should demonstrate proper accessibility implementation
