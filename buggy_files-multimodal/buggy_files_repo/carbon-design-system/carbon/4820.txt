Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The AVT 1 dropdown component has DAP (Digital Accessibility Platform) violations
- The violations occur in different states:
  - Default state: "Combobox must have aria-expanded attribute"
  - Disabled state: "Combobox must have aria-expanded attribute"
  - Form invalid state: "Combobox must have aria-expanded attribute"

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue appears to be missing ARIA attributes, specifically `aria-expanded`, on the dropdown/combobox component
- This is an accessibility violation as screen readers need to know whether a dropdown menu is expanded or collapsed
- The issue persists across different states (default, disabled, invalid) suggesting it's a fundamental implementation issue in the base dropdown component

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxField.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuIcon.js
packages/react/src/globals/js/mixins/track-blur.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `Dropdown.js` is the main component showing the violations
2. `ComboBox.js` shares similar functionality and accessibility requirements
3. `ListBoxField.js` handles the field portion of dropdown/listbox components including ARIA attributes
4. `ListBoxMenuIcon.js` manages the expand/collapse icon state which should sync with aria-expanded
5. `track-blur.js` handles focus management which is related to expansion state tracking
