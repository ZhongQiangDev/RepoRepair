Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The OverflowMenu inside a DataTable doesn't show visual indicators for keyboard navigation
- Users can't see which menu item is currently focused/active when using arrow keys
- This breaks keyboard accessibility as users can't tell which option they're about to select

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to missing keyboard-accessible styles for OverflowMenu items when rendered inside a DataTable
- The styles that normally highlight the active/focused menu item in standalone OverflowMenu are not being applied or are being overridden when the menu is nested within a DataTable
- This is likely a CSS specificity or inheritance issue where DataTable styles are interfering with OverflowMenu's keyboard navigation styles

3. Most Related Files:
```

packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarMenu.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- OverflowMenu.js (React) is the main component implementation that handles keyboard navigation and menu item styling
- DataTable.js (React) is where the OverflowMenu is being integrated and potentially affecting its styles
- overflow-menu.js (components) contains core overflow menu functionality and styles
- OverflowMenuItem.js handles individual menu item rendering and states
- TableToolbarMenu.js shows how overflow menus are specifically integrated into table toolbars, which could provide insight into the styling conflict
