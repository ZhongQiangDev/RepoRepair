Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `iconDescription` prop in TableBatchAction is incorrectly required even when there are visible children elements
- When there are children (visible labels), JAWS screen reader reads both the `iconDescription` and the visible label, causing redundant announcements
- The default value of `iconDescription` is incorrectly set to "Add" instead of an empty string

2. Cause Analysis:
- The component is enforcing `iconDescription` as a required prop unconditionally, without checking if there are visible children
- The ARIA labeling is not properly handling the case where visible text labels exist
- The default prop value is hardcoded to "Add" instead of being empty when not needed

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/isRequiredOneOf.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- TableBatchAction.js is the main component with the issue
- Button.js is likely the base component being used that needs proper ARIA handling
- The prop-types related files handle validation logic that needs to be updated
- TableBatchActions.js is the parent component that may need adjustments for proper accessibility

The fix would involve modifying these files to make `iconDescription` conditional based on the presence of children and updating the default value to an empty string.
