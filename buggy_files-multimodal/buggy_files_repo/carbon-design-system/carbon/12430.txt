Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves read-only inputs in a dropdown implementation. Based on the screenshots, there appears to be no visual or functional distinction when a dropdown is in a read-only state.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be missing implementation for read-only state handling in dropdown components. This would require:
- Adding a read-only prop to the dropdown component
- Implementing visual styling for read-only state
- Handling interaction prevention in read-only mode
- Adding tests to verify read-only behavior

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/FluidDropdown/FluidDropdown.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- Dropdown.js is the main component that needs the read-only implementation
- Dropdown.stories.js needs to be updated to showcase read-only state
- Select.js and ComboBox.js share similar input behavior and may need consistent read-only handling
- FluidDropdown.js extends dropdown functionality and would need to support read-only state
