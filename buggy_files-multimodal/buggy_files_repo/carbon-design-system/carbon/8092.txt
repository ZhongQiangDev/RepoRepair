Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The select component is missing a warning state visual treatment
- This appears to be a UI styling/state issue where warning feedback is not properly implemented

2. Cause Analysis:
- The select component likely needs to be updated to support a warning state similar to other form components
- This would involve adding warning-specific CSS classes and props to handle warning state styling
- The implementation would need to include visual indicators like warning colors/icons and potentially warning text

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/FormLabel/FormLabel.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. Select.js - The main component file that would need to be modified to add warning state support
2. Select-story.js - Contains component examples/documentation that would need to showcase the new warning state
3. Select-test.js - Tests would need to be updated to verify warning state behavior
4. Select.Skeleton.js - May need updates if warning state affects loading state appearance
5. FormLabel.js - Related form component that may influence how warning states are implemented

The core changes would primarily be in Select.js to add the warning state functionality, with supporting changes in the other files to maintain consistency.
