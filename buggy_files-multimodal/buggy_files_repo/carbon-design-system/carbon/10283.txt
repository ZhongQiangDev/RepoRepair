Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking the calendar icon in a date picker, keyboard navigation (using arrow keys) doesn't work
- However, keyboard navigation works fine when clicking directly on the input field to open the calendar

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a focus management issue in the date picker component
- When opening via calendar icon click, focus is likely staying on the icon button instead of moving to the calendar dropdown
- The calendar needs proper focus management to handle keyboard navigation regardless of how it's opened
- The core issue seems to be in the date picker's click handling and focus management logic

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/components/src/components/date-picker/date-picker.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/fixEventsPlugin.js
packages/react/src/internal/keyboard/navigation.js
packages/react/src/internal/focus/index.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `date-picker.js` is the core implementation file containing the main date picker logic and event handling
2. `DatePicker.js` (React version) provides the React component wrapper and additional focus management
3. `fixEventsPlugin.js` specifically handles keyboard events for the date picker
4. `navigation.js` contains keyboard navigation utilities used by the date picker
5. `focus/index.js` provides focus management utilities that would be relevant for this issue

The fix would likely involve modifying the click handler for the calendar icon to properly transfer focus to the calendar dropdown, enabling keyboard navigation.
