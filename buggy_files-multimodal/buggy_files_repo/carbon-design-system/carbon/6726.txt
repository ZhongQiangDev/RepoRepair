Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking the down arrow icon in the ComboBox component for the first time, the onClick function is not triggered
- This prevents the Ajax call from being made to populate the dropdown list
- The list appears empty on first click
- Subsequent clicks on the input field itself work correctly and populate the list

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be with event handling on the ComboBox's down arrow icon
- The first click on the arrow only toggles the visual state (flips the arrow) but doesn't trigger the onClick handler
- This suggests a potential issue with event propagation or handler attachment on the icon component
- The problem is specific to the icon click, as clicking the input field works correctly

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuIcon.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxField.js
packages/react/src/internal/keyboard/navigation.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. ComboBox.js is the main component where the onClick handler and Ajax call logic would be implemented
2. ListBoxMenuIcon.js handles the down arrow icon specifically mentioned in the issue
3. ListBox.js contains core dropdown functionality that may affect event handling
4. ListBoxField.js manages the input field area where the icon is located
5. navigation.js handles keyboard and click interactions that could influence event behavior

The fix would likely involve ensuring proper event handling and propagation from the ListBoxMenuIcon through to the ComboBox's onClick handler.
