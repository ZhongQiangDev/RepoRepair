Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The ActionableNotification component declares a `caption` prop type but doesn't actually render or use the caption value when provided
- When users input a string value for the caption attribute, nothing renders in the UI
- This prevents users from implementing features like timestamps in ActionableNotification components

2. Cause Analysis:
- The component has `caption` defined in its PropTypes validation but lacks the implementation to render the caption in its JSX/render logic
- This appears to be an oversight where the prop was defined but the corresponding UI rendering code was not implemented
- The issue affects the ActionableNotification component specifically within the @carbon/react package

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js
packages/react/src/components/Notification/stories/ActionableNotification.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-test.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/deprecate.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. Notification.js contains the core implementation of the ActionableNotification component where the caption prop needs to be implemented
2. ActionableNotification.stories.js shows example usage and would need updating to demonstrate the caption functionality
3. Notification-test.js would need new tests to verify the caption implementation
4. deprecate.js and createChainableTypeChecker.js handle prop-type validation which is relevant since the caption prop is currently only defined in prop-types
