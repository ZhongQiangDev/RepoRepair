Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Pagination component shows "NaN" when trying to display "All" as a page size option
- This occurs because the component tries to perform calculations with the text "All" instead of a numeric value

2. Cause Analysis:
- The current Pagination component only accepts numeric values in its pageSizes array
- When "All" is used as a value, the component's internal calculations for displaying item ranges and page numbers fail because it can't perform arithmetic with non-numeric values
- The component needs to be modified to support custom text labels while maintaining proper numeric values for calculations

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
packages/components/src/components/pagination/pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/PageSelector.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-story.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- The React Pagination component file is the main implementation that needs to be modified to support custom labels
- The base components pagination.js contains core pagination logic that may need updating
- The experimental Pagination files may already have patterns or solutions for handling custom labels
- The story file shows current usage patterns and can help verify the fix works with existing implementations
