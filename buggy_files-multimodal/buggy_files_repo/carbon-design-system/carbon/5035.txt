Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Container tabs text is not truncating properly at 16px from the edge
- This differs from default tabs which correctly truncate text with ellipsis at 16px from edge

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to CSS styling for text truncation in container tabs
- Looking at the screenshots, container tabs lack proper text overflow handling and spacing compared to default tabs
- This is likely a styling issue in the tab components where container tabs don't inherit or implement the same text truncation rules as default tabs

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the container tab text truncation issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js
```

These files are most important because:
- Tabs.js is the main component handling tab rendering and styling
- Tab.js manages individual tab behavior and appearance including text handling
- TabContent.js could affect how content within tabs is displayed and truncated

The issue would likely be fixed by modifying the CSS classes or styles in these files to ensure container tabs implement proper text truncation similar to default tabs.
