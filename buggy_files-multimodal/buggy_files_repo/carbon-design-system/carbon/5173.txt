Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using VoiceOver to navigate through tabs, it incorrectly announces each tab as "1 of 1" instead of announcing the correct position (e.g., "4 of 4" for the last tab)
- This affects the accessibility experience as users cannot know their position within the tab group

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be with ARIA attributes not being properly set on the tab elements to indicate their position within the tab group
- The tab component likely needs to track and announce the total number of tabs and current position
- This would require proper ARIA role="tab" and aria-setsize/aria-posinset attributes

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js
packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.js
packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.config.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `Tabs.js` (React) - Main component managing tab state and structure
2. `Tab.js` (React) - Individual tab component where ARIA attributes need to be set
3. `TabContent.js` (React) - Handles tab panel content and accessibility attributes
4. `tabs.js` (Components) - Core implementation of tabs functionality
5. `tabs.config.js` (Components) - Configuration including accessibility settings

The fix would likely involve modifying these files to properly track and set ARIA attributes for tab position announcements.
