Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Inline links by default have underline styling
- The underline is needed to make links more accessible by providing a visual differentiator beyond just color blue

2. Cause Analysis:
- This is related to link styling in the Carbon Design System
- The issue involves ensuring proper accessibility by having underlines on inline links by default
- The styling needs to be consistent across components that render links
- The core styling would likely be in base link components and shared styles

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Link/Link.js
packages/components/src/components/link/link.js
packages/react/src/components/Link/Link-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Link/Link-test.js
packages/components/demo/js/components/RootPage.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- Link.js files contain the core link component implementations where default styling would be defined
- Link-story.js and Link-test.js help validate the link behavior and styling
- RootPage.js shows how links are used in navigation context which would need consistent styling

These files would need to be modified to ensure inline links have underline styling by default while maintaining accessibility standards.
