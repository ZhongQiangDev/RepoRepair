Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves missing field validation error states for RadioGroup components. Specifically, the RadioGroup needs to support:
- Invalid (error) state
- Warning state 
- Helper text display

2. Cause Analysis:
Based on the screenshot and description, the RadioGroup component lacks proper validation state handling and visual feedback mechanisms. The component needs to be enhanced to:
- Display error/warning styling when validation fails
- Show helper text for additional context
- Handle invalid/warning states consistently with other form components

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup-test.js
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
packages/react/src/internal/useNormalizedInputProps.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- RadioButton.js and RadioButtonGroup.js contain the core components that need validation state support
- RadioButtonGroup-test.js will need updates to test new validation features
- FormGroup.js handles form-level validation display and messaging
- useNormalizedInputProps.js provides shared validation prop handling used by form components

The changes would primarily involve adding validation state handling to RadioButtonGroup and ensuring proper visual feedback through RadioButton styling.
