Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- An ExpandableTile with a StructuredList inside has accessibility issues:
  - When there's no interactive content, the tile renders as a button but buttons can't have children with roles (which StructuredList elements have)
  - When forcing interactive content with a hidden button, the aria-expanded attribute causes an error
- The workaround of adding a hidden button to force interactive content is not ideal

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue stems from how the ExpandableTile component handles its rendering modes:
  - It has two modes: interactive and non-interactive
  - In non-interactive mode, it wraps everything in a button which conflicts with ARIA rules
  - In interactive mode, it only makes the expando icon a button
- The component needs to properly handle cases where child elements have ARIA roles without requiring hacky workarounds

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx
packages/react/src/components/StructuredList/StructuredList.js
packages/react/src/internal/useNoInteractiveChildren.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-test.js
packages/react/src/components/StructuredList/StructuredList-test.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. Tile.tsx is the main component file where the ExpandableTile behavior needs to be fixed
2. StructuredList.js contains the component that's causing the role conflicts
3. useNoInteractiveChildren.js handles interactive content detection which is key to this issue
4. The test files will need updates to verify the fixed behavior
