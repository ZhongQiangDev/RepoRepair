Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `aria-label` prop on the Toggle component is not being picked up by screen readers
- Teams are forced to use `labelText` (which is not required) to label their toggles
- `labelA` and `labelB` props are hidden from screen readers, making them inaccessible
- Multiple toggles stacked or in toolbars lack proper accessibility labeling

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Toggle component is not properly forwarding the `aria-label` attribute to the underlying input element
- The component prioritizes `labelText` over `aria-label` for accessibility
- The implementation of `labelA` and `labelB` doesn't include proper ARIA attributes
- The component's accessibility implementation doesn't follow WCAG guidelines for form controls

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js
packages/components/src/components/toggle/toggle.js
packages/components/polyfills/toggle-class.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `Toggle.js` is the main React component implementation where the ARIA attributes need to be properly handled
2. `Toggle-story.js` contains examples and documentation that could help identify expected behavior
3. `Toggle-test.js` contains tests that should validate accessibility requirements
4. `toggle.js` is the base implementation that might affect ARIA attribute handling
5. `toggle-class.js` contains polyfills that could impact toggle functionality

The fix would primarily involve modifying `Toggle.js` to properly handle and forward the `aria-label` attribute to the underlying input element while maintaining proper accessibility standards.
