Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When passing the `light` prop to React listbox components, the `bx--list-box--light` class is not being applied to the underlying `<Listbox>` element, as shown in the screenshot from the React dropdown story.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the class name handling within the ListBox component implementation
- The `light` prop is likely not being properly propagated or transformed into the corresponding CSS class
- The class name construction logic in the ListBox component may be missing the handling of the `light` prop

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
packages/react/src/tools/wrapComponent.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `ListBox.js` is the core component that should handle the `light` prop and apply the corresponding class
- `Dropdown.js` and `ComboBox.js` are components that use ListBox and pass through the `light` prop
- `MultiSelect.js` also uses ListBox and needs to handle the `light` prop
- `wrapComponent.js` contains utilities for class name handling that might affect how the `light` class is applied

These files form the component hierarchy and styling infrastructure where the `light` prop handling needs to be fixed.
