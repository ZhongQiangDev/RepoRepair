Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When an icon-only button has focus and another icon-only button is hovered over, two tooltips are visible simultaneously and overlapping each other
- This creates visual clutter and poor user experience, especially since the buttons are small (48px)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The tooltip visibility is triggered by both focus and hover states
- When a button has focus (via click or tab), its tooltip remains visible
- When hovering over another button, that button's tooltip also becomes visible
- There's no logic to hide the focused button's tooltip when hovering over a different button
- The small button size (48px) means tooltips are likely to overlap due to proximity

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/TooltipDefinition.js
packages/react/src/components/TooltipIcon/TooltipIcon.js
packages/components/src/components/tooltip/tooltip.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `Tooltip.js` (React) is the main component handling tooltip visibility logic and positioning
- `Button.js` manages the icon-only button behavior and tooltip integration
- `TooltipDefinition.js` and `TooltipIcon.js` contain related tooltip functionality that may affect the behavior
- `tooltip.js` (components) contains core tooltip functionality that could influence the visibility behavior

The fix would likely involve modifying the tooltip visibility logic in these files to ensure only one tooltip is visible at a time, particularly when hovering over a different button while another has focus.
