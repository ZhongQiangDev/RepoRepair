Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The copy button in CodeSnippet component is not positioned correctly in 'single' mode
- The `.bx--copy-btn` class is overriding the `position` style to `relative` instead of `absolute`

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be caused by CSS class specificity conflicts between the CodeSnippet and CopyButton components
- The import order of SCSS files shows CopyButton styles are imported after CodeSnippet styles, causing CopyButton's position style to override CodeSnippet's intended absolute positioning
- This suggests the copy button styling needs to be properly scoped or the import order needs to be adjusted

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/components/src/components/code-snippet/code-snippet.js
packages/components/src/components/copy-button/copy-button.js
packages/components/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
packages/components/src/components/CopyButton/CopyButton.js
packages/bundler/src/bundlers/scss.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. code-snippet.js contains the core component where the positioning issue occurs
2. copy-button.js contains the button component causing the style override
3. CodeSnippet.js and CopyButton.js contain the React implementations that use these components
4. scss.js handles the SCSS bundling and could help resolve the import order issue
