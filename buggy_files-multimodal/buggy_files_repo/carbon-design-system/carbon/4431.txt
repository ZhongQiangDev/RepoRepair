Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The issue involves needing an alternative styling for the Tabs component that looks different from the default style, as shown in the provided image.
- This appears to be a feature request rather than a bug, as the user wants to add a secondary visual style option for tabs.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Tabs component currently only has one default style
- To add a secondary style, changes would be needed in:
- The core Tabs component files to support style variants
- CSS/SCSS files that define the tab styles
- Story/example files to demonstrate the new style variant

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files for implementing a secondary tab style:

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `Tabs.js` (React) is the main component implementation that would need to support style variants
2. `tabs.js` contains core tab functionality and styling logic
3. `Tab.js` handles individual tab rendering and would need style variant support
4. `TabContent.js` manages tab content display and may need style adjustments
5. `Tabs-story.js` would need updating to showcase the new style variant
