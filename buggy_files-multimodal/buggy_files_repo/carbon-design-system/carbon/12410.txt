From the GitHub problem description, I can see:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The slider implementation needs to support read-only inputs, which is currently missing. This affects both the visual styling and interaction behavior of sliders when they should be non-editable.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue requires adding read-only functionality to the slider component, which involves:
- Adding a read-only prop to control the state
- Implementing styles for the read-only state
- Preventing interactions when in read-only mode
- Adding tests to verify the read-only behavior
- Adding playground controls to demonstrate the feature

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.js
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider-test.js
packages/react/src/internal/useControllableState.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- Slider.js is the main component that needs the read-only implementation
- Slider.stories.js needs updating to showcase the read-only state
- Slider-test.js needs new tests for read-only functionality
- useControllableState.js helps manage controlled/uncontrolled state which may interact with read-only behavior
- requiredIfValueExists.js helps with prop validation which will be needed for the new read-only prop
