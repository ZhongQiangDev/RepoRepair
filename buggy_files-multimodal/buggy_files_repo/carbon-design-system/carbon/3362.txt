Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The DAP (Dynamic Assessment Plugin) violation shows that a "role" attribute is incorrectly present on a label element in the FileUploaderButton component.
- The error message specifically states that removing "role" from the label would fix the issue.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The FileUploaderButton component is likely adding a "role" attribute to its label element unnecessarily.
- Labels inherently have semantic meaning in HTML and don't need an explicit ARIA role.
- Adding unnecessary ARIA roles can confuse screen readers and violate accessibility guidelines.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader.js
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader-story.js
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/deprecate.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js
```

The FileUploader.js is the main component file where the role attribute needs to be removed from the label element. The story and skeleton files are related as they use or test the component. The prop-types files are included as they may be involved in validating component props including ARIA attributes.
