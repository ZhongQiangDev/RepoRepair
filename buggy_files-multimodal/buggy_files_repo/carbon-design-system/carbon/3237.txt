Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a modal is open, the background (body/parent element) can still be scrolled
- This behavior is undesirable as it can distract from the modal content and create confusion about which content is interactive

2. Cause Analysis:
- The modal component is not preventing scroll events on the body/parent element when opened
- This is typically handled by adding a class (like `modal-open`) to the body element that sets `overflow: hidden`
- The current implementation in Carbon's modal components lacks this scroll prevention mechanism

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
packages/components/src/components/modal/modal.js
packages/react/src/components/ModalWrapper/ModalWrapper.js
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal-story.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `Modal.js` and `ComposedModal.js` contain the core modal implementation where scroll behavior should be managed
- `modal.js` in components package contains the base modal functionality
- `ModalWrapper.js` provides additional modal functionality that could affect scrolling
- `Modal-story.js` shows example implementations and could help verify the behavior

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in the Modal.js files to prevent body scrolling when the modal is open.
