Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When `pagesUnknown` prop is set to `true`, the page number is displayed redundantly
- For example, if page 1 is selected, it shows "1 page 1"
- This creates unnecessary repetition and poor UX

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the pagination component's text rendering logic
- When `pagesUnknown` is true, the component is still displaying both:
  a) The selected page number from the dropdown
  b) The "page X" text that follows
- This suggests the component isn't properly handling the text display logic when `pagesUnknown` is enabled

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in the pagination implementation:

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js
```

The main file would be `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js` as it contains the core pagination logic and rendering. The experimental version might contain fixes or improvements, and the PaginationNav component might share some common functionality. The issue likely needs to be fixed in the main Pagination component's text rendering logic when `pagesUnknown` is true.
