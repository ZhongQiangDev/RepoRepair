Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The FileUploaderDropContainer has nested interactive controls, specifically an input element inside a div with role="button"
- This violates WCAG accessibility guidelines as it can cause confusion for screen readers and keyboard navigation

2. Cause Analysis:
- The component renders a structure where an input element is nested inside a div with role="button"
- The generated DOM shows:
```html
<div class="bx--file__drop-container" role="button">Add file<input type="file" id="id1" class="bx--file-input" tabindex="-1" accept=""></div>
```
- This creates accessibility issues because having interactive elements nested inside other interactive elements can lead to unpredictable behavior and poor user experience for those using assistive technologies

3. Most Related Files:
The key files involved in this issue would be:

```
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderDropContainer.js
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader.js
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader-story.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
1. FileUploaderDropContainer.js is the main component causing the issue and would need to be modified to fix the nested interactive controls problem
2. FileUploader.js is the parent component that may influence how the drop container is structured
3. FileUploader-story.js contains examples and documentation that would need to be updated to reflect any structural changes

The fix would likely involve restructuring the FileUploaderDropContainer component to avoid nesting the input element inside the button role div, possibly by using aria-controls or other ARIA attributes to maintain the relationship between elements without nesting them.
