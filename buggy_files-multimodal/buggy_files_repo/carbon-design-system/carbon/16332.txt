I'll analyze the GitHub problem description to identify the wrong behavior, analyze the cause, and find the most relevant files that need to be edited.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is about inconsistent prop naming for accessibility attributes in Carbon components. Specifically:
- Some components use `ariaLabel` (camelCase)
- Others use `aria-label` (kebab-case)

According to React's official documentation on WAI-ARIA, accessibility attributes should be hyphen-cased (kebab-case) as `aria-label` rather than camelCased as `ariaLabel`.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue stems from inconsistent implementation across different Carbon components. Some components were created using `ariaLabel` (camelCase) while others correctly use `aria-label` (kebab-case). According to the GitHub issue, there are currently 13 components that need to be refactored to use `aria-label` instead of `ariaLabel`.

## Most Related Files
Based on the repository information and the components mentioned in the GitHub issue, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
packages/react/src/components/StructuredList/StructuredList-test.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-test.js
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-test.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-test.js
```

These files represent the test files for some of the components mentioned in the GitHub issue that need to be refactored. The actual component implementation files would also need to be modified, but the test files provide a good indication of which components are using `ariaLabel` instead of `aria-label`.
