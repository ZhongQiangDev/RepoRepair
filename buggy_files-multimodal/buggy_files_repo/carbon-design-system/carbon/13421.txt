Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Destructuring the DataTable component to get its subcomponents (TableContainer, Table, etc.) causes the application to break
- The error appears to be related to undefined components when trying to use them after destructuring

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how the DataTable component is structured in the Carbon Design System
- The DataTable export likely doesn't include these subcomponents as properties that can be destructured
- The correct approach is to import each component directly from '@carbon/react'
- This suggests the components are separate exports rather than nested properties of DataTable

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBody.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/stories/DataTable-basic.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/stories/dynamic-content/DataTable-dynamic-content.stories.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- DataTable.js is the main component file where the export structure is defined
- TableContainer.js and TableBody.js represent the individual components that should be imported separately
- The story files demonstrate the correct usage patterns for these components
- The files show that these components are designed to be imported individually rather than accessed through destructuring
