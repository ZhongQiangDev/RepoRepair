Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The content switcher fails to provide sufficient contrast (3:1 minimum) for visual information required to identify the component
- The light grey outline of unselected tabs has only 1.1:1 contrast against the background
- Without proper contrast, the component can be misidentified as a standalone black button rather than a multi-tab switcher

2. Cause Analysis:
- The core issue lies in the visual styling/theming of the content switcher component
- The unselected tabs lack sufficient visual binding to indicate they are part of the same component
- The low contrast of unselected tab outlines makes it difficult to perceive the full component structure
- This is primarily a CSS/styling issue in the content switcher component implementation

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
packages/components/src/components/content-switcher/content-switcher.js
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js
packages/components/src/components/Switch/Switch.js
packages/themes/src/tools.js
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- The core content switcher component files contain the styling and structure implementation
- The Switch component is used within the content switcher for individual tabs
- The themes tools file handles color contrast and styling utilities
- The story file demonstrates usage patterns that may need updating for accessibility

The fix would likely involve modifying the CSS/styling in these files to ensure proper contrast ratios for all visual elements that identify the component structure.
