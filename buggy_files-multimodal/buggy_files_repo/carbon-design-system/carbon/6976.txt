Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- `focusable="false"` is unnecessarily set on a `span` element which doesn't support this attribute
- `tabindex="0"` is redundantly set on a button element since buttons are focusable by default

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from the OverflowMenu component in carbon-components-react where these attributes are hardcoded:
  - `focusable="false"` is set at line 524
  - `tabindex="0"` is set at line 219
- While these don't cause functional issues, they represent unnecessary and incorrect attribute usage that could confuse screen readers or accessibility tools

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
packages/components/src/components/overflow-menu/overflow-menu.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. `OverflowMenu.js` (React) is the direct implementation where the issue exists
2. `overflow-menu.js` (Components) contains the base implementation that may influence the React component
3. `HeaderMenu.js` and `SideNavMenu.js` are related menu components that may share similar accessibility patterns
4. `FloatingMenu.js` is the internal component that OverflowMenu extends from, which may influence its behavior

The fix would need to focus primarily on the OverflowMenu React component to remove these unnecessary attributes while ensuring accessibility is maintained.
