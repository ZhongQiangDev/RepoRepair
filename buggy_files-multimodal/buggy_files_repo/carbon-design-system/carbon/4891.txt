Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The search cancel icon button has poor color contrast against the recently introduced skyblue background color for autofill in Chrome. This creates an accessibility issue as the icon may be difficult to see.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from Chrome's autofill feature which applies a skyblue background color to autofilled inputs. This background color conflicts with the existing cancel icon button styling, resulting in insufficient color contrast. This is a browser-specific issue that needs to be handled in the component's CSS/styling.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.js
packages/react/src/components/Search/Search-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Search/Search-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/SearchFilterButton/SearchFilterButton.js
```

The Search.js file is most important as it contains the core component implementation including the cancel button. The story and test files help verify the styling and behavior. The Skeleton and FilterButton files are related but less critical for this specific issue.
