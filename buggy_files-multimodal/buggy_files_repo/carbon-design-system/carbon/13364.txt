Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Inconsistent usage of `ariaLabel` vs `aria-label` props across Carbon components
- Some components accept only `ariaLabel`, others only `aria-label`, and some accept both
- This inconsistency goes against React's official WAI-ARIA documentation which recommends using hyphen-cased attributes (`aria-label`)

2. Cause Analysis:
- Historical development led to inconsistent implementation of ARIA label props
- Some components use camelCase (`ariaLabel`) while others follow React's recommended kebab-case (`aria-label`)
- Need to refactor components to standardize on `aria-label` while maintaining backward compatibility
- According to React docs, ARIA attributes should be hyphen-cased even though most DOM properties in React are camelCased

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/StructuredList/StructuredList.js
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
1. StructuredList.js - Contains `ariaLabel` usage that needs refactoring
2. OverflowMenu.js - Another component using `ariaLabel` that needs updating
3. NumberInput.js - Uses `ariaLabel` and needs standardization
4. ComboBox.js - Contains `ariaLabel` implementation requiring update
5. CodeSnippet.js - Uses `ariaLabel` and needs refactoring to `aria-label`

These components were specifically mentioned in the GitHub issue's task list as needing refactoring from `ariaLabel` to `aria-label`.
