Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The tabs component automatically switches to a dropdown menu when the browser width gets smaller
- The measurement for switching is based on browser width rather than available component width
- The markup changes from tabs to a listbox/dropdown, making it confusing for screen readers

2. Cause Analysis:
- The component is using browser width as a trigger for responsive behavior instead of container width
- The component completely changes its semantic structure (from tabs to dropdown) which breaks accessibility
- This appears to be an architectural issue in how the tabs component handles responsive states

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/components/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.config.js
packages/components/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
packages/components/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
packages/components/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `Tabs.js` is the main component implementation where the responsive behavior and markup structure would be defined
2. `tabs.config.js` contains configuration that may control the dropdown variant behavior
3. `Tabs-story.js` demonstrates usage patterns and documents the component behavior
4. `Tab.js` handles individual tab rendering and may contribute to accessibility issues
5. `TabContent.js` manages content rendering and could be involved in the markup transformation

The fix would likely involve modifying these files to:
- Remove the dropdown variant completely
- Use container queries or ResizeObserver instead of window width
- Maintain consistent tab markup for accessibility
