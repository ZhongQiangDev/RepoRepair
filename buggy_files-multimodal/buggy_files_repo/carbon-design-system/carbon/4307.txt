Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- DAP (Dynamic Assessment Plugin) reports violations for missing labels on form components including Checkbox, NumberInput, Select, Slider, TextArea & TextInput
- This is an accessibility violation as form controls need proper labels to be usable by screen readers

2. Cause Analysis:
- The components are missing proper label associations in their skeleton (loading) states
- The skeleton versions of these components need to maintain accessibility even during loading by including proper `labelText` props and ARIA attributes
- This ensures screen readers can identify the purpose of each form control even before the actual content loads

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/TextArea/TextArea.Skeleton.js
```

These files are the skeleton implementations of the form components mentioned in the issue. They need to be modified to include proper label associations and ARIA attributes during their loading states. The order reflects the components shown in the screenshots, with TextInput being the most prominently featured example.
