From the GitHub Problem Description, the issue is that Carbon Design System lacks a Progress Bar component to illustrate percent-complete status of long running processes, which is needed for the Cloud Pak for Data UX team's installation process.

The cause is that while Carbon has a Progress Indicator component for showing steps in a wizard-like process, it doesn't have a dedicated component for showing continuous progress with a colored bar and percentage.

Looking at the repository information, these files would be most relevant to implementing a Progress Bar component:

```
packages/components/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.js
packages/components/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator-story.js
packages/components/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js
packages/components/src/components/InlineLoading/InlineLoading.js
packages/components/src/components/Loading/Loading.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. ProgressIndicator.js contains the core implementation of the existing progress component that would need to be adapted or referenced
2. ProgressIndicator-story.js shows usage examples and props that would inform the new component's API
3. ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js handles loading states which would be relevant for progress bars
4. InlineLoading.js and Loading.js handle related progress/loading UI patterns that would inform the design

The new Progress Bar component would likely need to be implemented alongside these existing components while sharing common patterns and styles.
