Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The icon-only Tabs and ContainedTabs variants don't support size customization
- They should come in two sizes: 40px (default) and 48px (large)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Tabs components lack size prop handling for icon-only variants
- The styling and layout need to be updated to support different size options
- Both Line Tabs and ContainedTabs components need modifications to implement this feature

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/Tabs.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
```

Reasoning:
- `next/Tabs.js` is the primary file for the new Tabs implementation where size prop support needs to be added
- `Tabs.js` contains the base Tabs component logic that may need updating for size handling
- `Tab.js` defines individual tab behavior and styling that needs size-based modifications
- `next/Tabs.stories.js` and `Tabs-story.js` contain examples and documentation that need updating to showcase the new size options

These files would need to be modified to implement size customization for icon-only tab variants.
