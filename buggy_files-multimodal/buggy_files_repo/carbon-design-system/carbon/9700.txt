Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Modal inputs are not spanning the full width of the modal container
- This is a regression, meaning it worked before but broke after some changes
- The screenshot shows inputs with gaps on the sides instead of filling the modal width

2. Cause Analysis:
- Based on the screenshots and description, this appears to be a CSS styling issue
- The modal component's styling is not properly handling input field widths
- Since it's mentioned as a regression, recent changes to modal or form styling likely caused this
- The issue likely involves either the Modal component's container styles or the form input styling within modals

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
packages/react/src/components/Form/Form.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
packages/react/src/components/FluidForm/FluidForm.js
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
1. Modal.js is the core component where the width issue is occurring
2. Form.js handles the base form styling that affects input widths
3. TextInput.js contains the input component styling
4. FluidForm.js specifically handles fluid/full-width form layouts
5. ComposedModal.js may contain additional modal styling that affects input widths

The fix would likely involve adjusting the CSS in one or more of these files to ensure inputs properly span the full modal width.
