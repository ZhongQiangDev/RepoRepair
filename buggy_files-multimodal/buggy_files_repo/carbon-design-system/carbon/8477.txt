Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The current "expressive theme" in Carbon assumes most IBM.com experiences are for long-form reading/marketing, but this has proven incorrect.
- Many productive experiences (14px type size, compact components) are needed across various IBM.com pages (Homepage, Search, Products catalog, etc.).
- The current approach of using "expressive theme" doesn't match the actual usage patterns.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The design system incorrectly assumed a single theme (expressive) would cover most use cases
- There's a mismatch between the default theme's styling (larger text, expanded components) and the actual needs (14px type, compact components)
- The solution requires adding expressive tokens and components while deprecating the general "expressive theme"

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/components/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/components/src/components/List/List.js
packages/type/src/scale.js
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- Button.js and List.js are core components that need expressive variants
- scale.js handles typography scaling which needs adjustment for expressive variants
- tokens.js and themes.js manage theme tokens and generation, which need updating to support both expressive and productive styles while deprecating the general expressive theme
