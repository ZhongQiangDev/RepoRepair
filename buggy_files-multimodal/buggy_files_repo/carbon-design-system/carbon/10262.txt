Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The `TooltipDefinition` component only accepts string values for its `children` prop
- When trying to use other React elements like `<h2>` or `<p>` as children, console warnings appear
- The component is rendered as a button, so wrapping it in heading tags doesn't work as a workaround

2. Cause Analysis:
- The PropType for the `children` prop in `TooltipDefinition` component is set to `PropTypes.string`
- This restrictive PropType validation causes warnings when non-string children are passed
- The component needs to support `PropTypes.node` to allow any valid React node as children

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the issue description, here are the most relevant files:

```
packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition.js
packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition-test.js
packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition-story.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/childrenOfType.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. TooltipDefinition.js contains the main component implementation and PropType definition that needs to be changed
2. The test file needs to be updated to verify the new PropType behavior
3. The story file may need updates to demonstrate the new functionality
4. The prop-types utility files are related to type checking implementation but less directly involved
