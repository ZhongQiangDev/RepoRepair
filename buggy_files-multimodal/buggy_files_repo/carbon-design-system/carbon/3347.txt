Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When setting `danger` prop to true on ComposedModal, the left button (cancel button) appears gray instead of black
- This differs from the Modal component where the left button is black when danger=true
- The issue stems from the button's `kind` property being set to "tertiary" (gray) instead of "secondary" (black) in ComposedModal

2. Cause Analysis:
- In ComposedModal, there's a conditional statement that sets the left button's kind:
`kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}`
- This means when danger=true, it sets kind='tertiary' (gray)
- This differs from Modal's implementation where the left button remains "secondary" (black) even when danger=true
- This appears to be an inconsistency in how danger states are handled between Modal and ComposedModal components

3. Most relevant files:
```
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal-story.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. ComposedModal.js contains the actual implementation with the incorrect conditional logic
2. Modal.js has the correct implementation to compare against
3. ComposedModal-test.js would need updating to test the fixed behavior
4. Button.js is the base component affected by the kind prop
5. ComposedModal-story.js contains examples/documentation that would need updating
