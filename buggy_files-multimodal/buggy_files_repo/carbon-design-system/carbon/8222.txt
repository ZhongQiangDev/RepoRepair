Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The button's danger state (likely indicating a destructive/irreversible action) is not being communicated to screen reader users
- While the danger state is visually apparent, it lacks the necessary accessibility attributes for assistive technologies

2. Cause Analysis:
- The button component lacks proper ARIA attributes to convey its dangerous nature to screen readers
- There's no descriptive text or ARIA description linking the button to its dangerous implications
- The suggested solution involves adding a visually hidden span with a unique ID that can be referenced via aria-describedby

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/DangerButton/DangerButton.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
packages/react/src/components/DangerButton/DangerButton-test.js
packages/components/src/components/button/button.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- Button.js is the core button component implementation where ARIA attributes would need to be added
- DangerButton.js specifically handles danger-state buttons
- Button-story.js and DangerButton-test.js contain examples and tests that would need updating
- button.js (from components) may contain shared button functionality

The fix would primarily involve modifying these files to add proper ARIA attributes and descriptions for danger states.
