Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Screen readers cannot read the label text of radio buttons in the React version
- In vanilla HTML, the screen reader correctly reads "Radio button label"
- In React version, the label is not accessible to screen readers

2. Cause Analysis:
Looking at the HTML comparison:
- Vanilla HTML has the label text directly in a `span` with class `bx--radio-button__label-text`
- React version adds an unnecessary `aria-label` to the `label` element while the text is in a `span` without the proper class
- The missing `bx--radio-button__label-text` class and redundant `aria-label` appear to be causing the accessibility issue

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton-test.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
1. `RadioButton.js` is the main component that needs fixing as it handles the label rendering and accessibility attributes
2. `RadioButtonGroup.js` may need updates to ensure proper label handling for grouped radio buttons
3. `RadioButton-test.js` would need updated tests to verify the fixed accessibility behavior

The fix would likely involve:
- Removing the redundant `aria-label` from the label element
- Adding the proper `bx--radio-button__label-text` class to the label's span element
- Updating tests to verify screen reader accessibility
