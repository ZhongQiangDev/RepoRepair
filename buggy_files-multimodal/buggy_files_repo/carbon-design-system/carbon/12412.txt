Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The RadioButton implementation lacks support for read-only inputs
- The UI should visually indicate when a RadioButton is in read-only state
- Currently there's no way to make RadioButtons read-only while maintaining their visual appearance

2. Cause Analysis:
- The RadioButton component needs to be updated to:
  - Accept a read-only prop
  - Add appropriate styling for read-only state
  - Prevent interaction when in read-only mode
  - Maintain visual appearance while being non-interactive
- This requires changes to both the component logic and its styling

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton-test.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup-test.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. RadioButton.js is the main component that needs to be modified to support read-only state
2. RadioButton.stories.js needs updates to showcase the new read-only functionality
3. RadioButtonGroup.js may need updates to handle read-only state for grouped radio buttons
4. The test files need to be updated to include test cases for read-only functionality
