Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The pagination component overflows its container on smaller viewports (above 42rem)
- The overflow is set to visible instead of being scrollable
- This creates a poor user experience as content extends beyond its intended boundaries

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to CSS overflow handling in the pagination component
- The problem occurs specifically above 42rem viewport width
- The pagination container lacks proper overflow control and responsive styling
- Based on the screenshots, the pagination buttons extend beyond their container instead of wrapping or enabling horizontal scrolling

3. Most Related Files:
Looking at the repository files, these are most relevant to fixing the pagination overflow issue:

```
packages/components/src/components/pagination/pagination.js
packages/components/src/components/pagination-nav/pagination-nav.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
packages/components/src/globals/scss/_helper-mixins.scss
packages/components/src/globals/scss/_layout.scss
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. pagination.js contains the core pagination component implementation
2. pagination-nav.js handles pagination navigation which is directly related to the overflow
3. React's Pagination.js contains responsive layout logic
4. _helper-mixins.scss likely contains overflow and responsive utilities
5. _layout.scss contains base layout rules that affect container behavior

The fix would likely involve modifying the overflow and responsive layout rules in these files to ensure proper container behavior on smaller viewports.
