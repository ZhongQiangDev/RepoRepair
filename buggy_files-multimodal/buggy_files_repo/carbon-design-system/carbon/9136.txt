Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The ComboBox component no longer accepts refs properly
- Warning appears in console about ref usage
- The ref functionality that previously worked is now broken

2. Cause Analysis:
- The ComboBox component was rewritten from a class component to a functional component in March 2021
- During this rewrite, proper ref forwarding was not implemented
- Unlike TextInput which has proper ref forwarding implementation, ComboBox lacks this functionality
- This is evident from the error when trying to use ref={()=>console.log('some ref here')}

3. Most Related Files:
The key files needed to fix this issue would be:

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
packages/react/src/tools/mergeRefs.js
packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js
```

Reasoning:
- ComboBox.js is the main component that needs to be modified to support refs
- TextInput.js serves as a reference implementation for proper ref forwarding
- mergeRefs.js provides utilities for handling multiple refs if needed
- ComponentToggle.js shows patterns for ref forwarding in functional components
- createChainableTypeChecker.js helps with prop validation including refs

The fix would primarily involve modifying ComboBox.js to implement React.forwardRef similar to how TextInput.js handles it.
