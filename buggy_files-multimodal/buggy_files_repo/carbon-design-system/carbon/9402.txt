Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When a user opens a ComboBox and clicks on another ComboBox's chevron, the first ComboBox remains open instead of dismissing
- This only happens between ComboBoxes - clicking a DropDown does dismiss an open ComboBox
- The issue appeared after upgrading from Carbon v10.23.2 to v10.37.0

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a focus/blur handling issue in the ComboBox component
- The component likely isn't properly handling click events outside its boundaries when those clicks are on another ComboBox
- The issue seems specific to interaction between ComboBox components, suggesting the click event handling or focus management between ComboBoxes needs fixing
- Since DropDowns can dismiss ComboBoxes correctly, the issue is likely in the ComboBox-specific implementation

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/internal/ClickListener.js
packages/react/src/internal/useOutsideClick.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxField.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- ComboBox.js is the main component where the issue manifests
- ClickListener.js and useOutsideClick.js handle outside click detection which is crucial for dismissing menus
- ListBox.js and ListBoxField.js are core components used by ComboBox for rendering the dropdown portion and handling interactions

The fix would likely involve modifying how ComboBox.js handles click events and focus management, possibly updating the ClickListener or useOutsideClick implementation to properly handle interactions between multiple ComboBox instances.
