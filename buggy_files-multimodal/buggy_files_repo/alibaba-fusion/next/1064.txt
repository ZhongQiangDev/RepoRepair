Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The Field component is modifying the input data directly when it shouldn't. This is evident from the screenshot showing that the original data object is being changed when it should remain immutable.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from the Field component directly mutating the input data object instead of creating a copy before making modifications. This violates React's principle of immutability and can cause unexpected side effects in the application.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
es/field/index.js
lib/field/index.js
es/field/utils.js
lib/field/utils.js
src/field/index.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `es/field/index.js` and `lib/field/index.js` contain the core Field component implementation where the mutation is likely occurring
- `es/field/utils.js` and `lib/field/utils.js` contain utility functions for handling field data and state management
- `src/field/index.js` contains the source code that gets compiled into the es/lib versions

The issue likely needs to be fixed in the source file (`src/field/index.js`) by ensuring proper immutable data handling, which will then propagate to the compiled versions in es/ and lib/ directories.
