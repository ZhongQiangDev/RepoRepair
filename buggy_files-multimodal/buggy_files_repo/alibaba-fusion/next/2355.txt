Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that the Table component's `dataIndex` prop doesn't support string values in the format `'[start, end]'`. This causes rendering issues when such values are used, even though this format is needed for business requirements.

2. Cause Analysis:
Looking at the screenshots and description, the core issue appears to be in how the Table component processes the `dataIndex` prop for accessing nested data. The current implementation likely doesn't properly handle array-like string notation (`'[start, end]'`) when retrieving values from the data source. This would be handled in the core table utilities that manage data access and cell rendering.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
src/table/util.js
src/table/base/cell.jsx
src/table/base.jsx
src/table/column.jsx
src/table/index.jsx
```

These files are selected because:
- `src/table/util.js` contains utility functions for handling data access in tables, which is where the `dataIndex` parsing would occur
- `src/table/base/cell.jsx` handles cell rendering and data retrieval
- `src/table/base.jsx` contains core table functionality
- `src/table/column.jsx` defines column properties and handling
- `src/table/index.jsx` serves as the main entry point for the Table component

The fix would likely involve modifying the data access utilities to properly handle array-like string notation in the `dataIndex` prop.
