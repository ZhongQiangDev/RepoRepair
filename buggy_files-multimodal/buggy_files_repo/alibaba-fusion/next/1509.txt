Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and screenshot, the problem is that the `popupContainer` configuration set on `ConfigProvider` is not being applied to Dialog components, causing incorrect positioning/containment of dialogs.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely stems from how Dialog components handle their container/positioning logic and how they interact with ConfigProvider's context. The Dialog component may not be properly consuming the popupContainer configuration from the ConfigProvider context, or there could be an issue in how the overlay positioning is being managed.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/dialog/dialog.jsx
src/overlay/overlay.jsx
src/overlay/popup.jsx
src/dialog/inner.jsx
src/overlay/position.jsx
```

These files are most relevant because:
- dialog.jsx is the main Dialog component implementation that should consume ConfigProvider context
- overlay.jsx handles the core overlay functionality used by Dialog
- popup.jsx manages popup positioning and container logic
- inner.jsx contains the internal Dialog rendering logic
- position.jsx handles the positioning calculations that may need to account for custom containers

The fix would likely involve modifying how these components consume and apply the popupContainer configuration from ConfigProvider.
