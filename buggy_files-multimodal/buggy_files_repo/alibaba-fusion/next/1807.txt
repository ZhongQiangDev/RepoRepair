Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The Menu Item automatically adds a title attribute that shows the full text when hovering
- This causes two issues:
  - When title matches innerText exactly, it violates WCAG's "no duplicate text" principle
  - Some business users don't want the title tooltip to appear

2. Cause Analysis:
- The Menu component is automatically adding the title attribute to Menu Items for two purposes:
  - To support screen readers (accessibility)
  - To show full text when content is truncated with ellipsis
- However, this automatic addition doesn't consider cases where:
  - The text is not truncated and matches exactly (causing duplication)
  - Users want to disable tooltips entirely

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/menu/view/item.jsx
src/menu/view/menu.jsx
src/menu/index.jsx
src/menu/view/create.jsx
src/menu-button/adaptor/index.jsx
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `item.jsx` would contain the core Menu.Item component logic where the title attribute is likely being added
- `menu.jsx` contains the main Menu component that manages overall menu behavior
- `menu/index.jsx` likely contains the configuration and export logic
- `create.jsx` handles menu item creation and properties
- `menu-button/adaptor/index.jsx` shows how menu items are used in menu buttons, which could be affected by this change
