Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking the "+" button in NumberPicker with defaultValue=4.02 and step=0.01, it shows 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03
- This occurs specifically in Safari browser

2. Cause Analysis:
- This is a JavaScript floating-point precision issue where arithmetic operations on decimal numbers can result in tiny rounding errors
- When adding 4.02 + 0.01, JavaScript's internal binary floating-point representation causes the result to be 4.029999999999999 instead of exactly 4.03
- The NumberPicker component needs to handle this precision issue by properly rounding the result to match the specified precision (2 decimal places in this case)

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/util/object.js
src/number-picker/input.jsx
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `src/number-picker/index.jsx` is the main NumberPicker component that handles value changes and step increments
- `src/util/object.js` contains utility functions that may be used for number handling and type checking
- `src/number-picker/input.jsx` likely handles the input value formatting and display

The fix would need to be implemented in these files to properly handle floating-point precision, likely by adding proper rounding logic when incrementing/decrementing values based on the specified precision prop.
