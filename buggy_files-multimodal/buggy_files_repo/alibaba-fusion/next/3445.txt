Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When an `id` attribute is added to the Rating component, the `onChange` event is triggered twice for a single click/interaction.

2. Cause Analysis:
- Looking at the code, this appears to be related to event handling in the Rating component.
- The issue likely stems from event bubbling or duplicate event binding when an id is present.
- The Rating component may be registering the event handler twice - once through its own logic and once through React's synthetic event system when an id is provided.

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files for this issue would be those directly involved with the Rating component's event handling and core functionality:

```
src/rating/rating.jsx
src/rating/index.jsx
src/util/events.js
docs/rating/theme/index.jsx
docs/rating/adaptor/index.jsx
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `rating.jsx` contains the core Rating component implementation and event handling logic
2. `index.jsx` handles prop processing and may affect event binding
3. `events.js` contains event handling utilities that could influence event propagation
4. `theme/index.jsx` shows how the Rating component is used in demos and may reveal usage patterns
5. `adaptor/index.jsx` handles component configuration and could affect event binding behavior

The fix would likely involve modifying the event handling logic in `rating.jsx` to prevent duplicate event triggers when an id is present.
