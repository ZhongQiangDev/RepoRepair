Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The error occurs when using CascaderSelect with `popupProps={{v2: true}}` and `showSearch` enabled. The screenshot shows a runtime error related to undefined `_v2n` property.

2. Cause Analysis:
The error suggests that when v2 popup mode is enabled along with search functionality, there's an issue with the internal cache mapping (`_v2n`) used for value-to-node lookups in the CascaderSelect component. This cache is essential for search functionality but appears to be incompatible with v2 popup mode.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx
src/cascader-select/index.jsx
src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx
src/cascader/cascader.jsx
src/cascader/item.jsx
```

Reasoning:
- `src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx` is the main component file where the `_v2n` cache is likely managed
- `src/cascader-select/index.jsx` handles prop migrations and configurations
- `src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx` contains the v2 popup implementation that's causing issues
- `src/cascader/cascader.jsx` provides core cascader functionality used by CascaderSelect
- `src/cascader/item.jsx` handles individual item rendering and may interact with search functionality

These files are most likely to contain the code that needs to be modified to fix the compatibility issue between v2 popup mode and search functionality.
