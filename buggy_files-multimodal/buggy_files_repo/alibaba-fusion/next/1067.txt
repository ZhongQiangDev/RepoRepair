Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub problem description and image, when `slidesToShow` is greater than `slidesCount`, `infinite={false}`, and `defaultActiveIndex` is not 0, the left arrow is incorrectly disabled.

2. Cause Analysis:
This appears to be a logic issue in the slider navigation handling where:
- When there are fewer slides than the number shown (`slidesToShow > slidesCount`)
- And infinite scrolling is disabled (`infinite={false}`)
- And starting from a non-zero index (`defaultActiveIndex !== 0`)
The left arrow's disabled state is incorrectly calculated, preventing navigation to previous slides when it should be possible.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/slider/slick/inner-slider.jsx
src/slider/slick/mixins/event-handlers.js
src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx
src/slider/slider.jsx
src/slider/slick/mixins/helpers.js
```

These files are selected because:
- `inner-slider.jsx` contains the core slider logic and state management
- `event-handlers.js` handles navigation and slide changes
- `arrow.jsx` manages the arrow rendering and disabled state
- `slider.jsx` is the main component wrapper
- `helpers.js` contains utility functions that might affect navigation calculations

The issue is most likely in the interaction between these files, particularly in how they calculate arrow disabled states when handling edge cases with slide counts and positions.
