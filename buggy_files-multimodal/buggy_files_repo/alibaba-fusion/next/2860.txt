Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When keyboard focus moves into the NumberPicker component, the operation buttons (up/down) remain hidden
- When focus moves to the operation buttons, the NumberPicker's focus style disappears
- The focus style should be maintained using `:focus-within` CSS selector

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to focus state management in the NumberPicker component
- The component isn't properly handling keyboard focus events
- The CSS styling for focus states isn't using the `:focus-within` selector which would maintain focus styling when child elements are focused
- The visibility of operation buttons isn't properly tied to the focus state of the component

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/input/base.jsx
src/mixin-ui-state/index.jsx
src/util/focus.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `number-picker.jsx` contains the core NumberPicker component implementation where focus behavior and button visibility are managed
- `index.jsx` handles the props transformation and validation for NumberPicker
- `base.jsx` provides base input functionality that NumberPicker likely extends
- `mixin-ui-state/index.jsx` handles UI state management including focus states
- `util/focus.js` contains utility functions for focus management
