Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub problem description and image, when Nav is in `iconOnly` mode, menu items without icons still appear as empty spaces, which is not the desired behavior. These items without icons should not be visible at all.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue likely stems from how the Nav component handles items without icons in `iconOnly` mode. When `iconOnly` is true, items without icons are still being rendered but with empty content, creating unnecessary whitespace. This suggests the filtering or conditional rendering logic for items without icons in `iconOnly` mode is missing or incorrect.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/nav/item.jsx
src/nav/nav.jsx
types/nav/index.d.ts
src/nav/group.jsx
src/nav/popup-item.jsx
```

Reasoning:
- `src/nav/item.jsx` is most critical as it handles the rendering logic for individual nav items and would need to implement the icon visibility check
- `src/nav/nav.jsx` contains the core Nav component logic and manages the `iconOnly` mode
- `types/nav/index.d.ts` defines the TypeScript interfaces and would need to reflect any changes to props/behavior
- `src/nav/group.jsx` may need updates for consistent handling of icon-only mode within groups
- `src/nav/popup-item.jsx` could require similar visibility logic for popup items
