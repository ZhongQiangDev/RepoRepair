Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using both `fixedHeader` and `resizable` features together in the Table component, clicking the filter button causes abnormal header display
- From the screenshot, it appears the filter dropdown menu is misaligned or incorrectly positioned relative to the header

2. Cause Analysis:
- This is likely a positioning issue caused by interaction between the fixed header functionality and the resizable columns feature
- When a header is fixed, it uses absolute positioning, while resizable columns may modify column widths dynamically
- The filter dropdown's position calculation may not account for both these features working together, leading to incorrect positioning when both are enabled

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/table/fixed/header.jsx
src/table/base/filter.jsx
src/table/fixed.jsx
src/table/base.jsx
src/table/base/header.jsx
```

These files are selected because:
- `fixed/header.jsx` handles fixed header positioning and behavior
- `base/filter.jsx` manages the filter dropdown functionality
- `fixed.jsx` contains core fixed table functionality that coordinates between fixed headers and other features
- `base.jsx` contains the foundational table logic
- `base/header.jsx` handles general header rendering and interactions

The issue likely needs to be addressed primarily in the interaction between fixed header positioning and filter dropdown rendering logic in these files.
