Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using NumberPicker, users can keep inputting numbers beyond the maximum value
- The value appears to increase in the input field but the actual price doesn't change
- The correction only happens on blur (when focus leaves the input)

2. Cause Analysis:
- The NumberPicker component is not properly validating input values against the max value during onChange events
- Instead, it's only validating and correcting values during onBlur events
- This creates a confusing user experience where they can type values that will later be reverted

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
src/number-picker/index.jsx
types/number-picker/index.d.ts
src/form/form.jsx
src/form/item.jsx
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `number-picker.jsx` contains the core NumberPicker component implementation where the validation logic needs to be fixed
- `index.jsx` handles prop transformations and validations for NumberPicker
- `types/number-picker/index.d.ts` defines the TypeScript interfaces and props that control NumberPicker behavior
- `form/form.jsx` and `form/item.jsx` handle form-level validation and may interact with NumberPicker validation

The fix would likely need to focus on modifying the onChange handler in `number-picker.jsx` to validate against max value immediately rather than waiting for blur events.
