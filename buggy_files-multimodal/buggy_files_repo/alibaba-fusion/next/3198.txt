Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and screenshot, when setting `timePanelProps.defaultValue` in DatePicker2, it displays "Invalid Date" instead of the expected time value.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to time value handling in DatePicker2, specifically when processing the defaultValue prop in the time panel. Looking at the code descriptions, this likely involves incorrect parsing or validation of the time value between the DatePicker2 component and its TimePanel subcomponent, particularly in the conversion between different date/time formats (dayjs objects).

3. Most Related Files:
Here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx
src/date-picker2/picker.jsx
src/date-picker2/panels/date-panel.jsx
src/time-picker2/panel.jsx
src/date-picker2/util.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `time-panel.jsx` directly handles the time panel rendering and value processing
- `picker.jsx` is the main DatePicker2 component that manages the time panel props
- `date-panel.jsx` integrates with the time panel and handles date-time coordination
- `time-picker2/panel.jsx` contains core time selection logic
- `util.js` contains utility functions for date/time handling that might affect value processing
