Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking on a tree node, the `selected` parameter in `extra` changes to `false` on first click
- After that, subsequent clicks don't change the `selected` value anymore
- The CSS styles also don't toggle between selected/unselected states
- Expected behavior is that `selected` should toggle between `true` and `false` with each click, with corresponding style changes

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with the selection state management in the Tree component
- The problem likely lies in how the selection state is tracked and updated in the tree node component
- The initial click handler works but subsequent state updates are not being processed correctly
- The style changes are tied to this selection state, explaining why they also don't update

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
src/tree/view/util.js
docs/tree/adaptor/index.jsx
docs/tree/theme/index.jsx
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `tree-node.jsx` handles individual node selection and state management
- `tree.jsx` manages the overall tree component state and selection logic
- `util.js` contains utility functions for tree operations including selection
- `adaptor/index.jsx` handles the integration of selection state with the UI
- `theme/index.jsx` manages the styling and visual feedback for selection states

The core issue is likely in the node selection handling code within these files, particularly in how the selection state is updated and maintained between clicks.
