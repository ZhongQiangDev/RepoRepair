Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and screenshot, the issue is that the Cascader component shows title information (tooltips) that the user wants to be able to hide/remove.

2. Cause Analysis:
The title/tooltip behavior is likely controlled by the Balloon/Tooltip components that are used within the Cascader component. The Cascader component probably inherits or uses these components for showing hover information, but lacks an API to disable this behavior.

3. Most Related Files:
Looking through the repository, these files appear most relevant to the tooltip/title behavior in Cascader components, ordered by importance:

```
src/cascader/cascader.jsx
types/cascader/index.d.ts
src/balloon/tooltip.jsx
src/balloon/inner.jsx
src/balloon/index.jsx
```

The reasoning:
- `src/cascader/cascader.jsx` is the main implementation file for the Cascader component
- `types/cascader/index.d.ts` defines the TypeScript interface and available props
- `src/balloon/tooltip.jsx` contains the tooltip implementation used by Cascader
- `src/balloon/inner.jsx` contains the core balloon/tooltip rendering logic
- `src/balloon/index.jsx` contains the main balloon component that powers tooltips

These files would need to be modified to add an API option to disable/hide tooltips in the Cascader component.
