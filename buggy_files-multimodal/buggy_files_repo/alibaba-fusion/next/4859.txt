Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue title "[CascaderSelect]使用虚拟滚动时背景色异常" and the screenshot, it appears that when using virtual scrolling in CascaderSelect component, there are background color rendering issues.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue likely stems from the virtual scrolling implementation in CascaderSelect not properly handling background colors for items
- Virtual scrolling typically involves rendering only visible items and managing their positioning/styling
- The background color anomaly suggests there might be issues with style inheritance or application when items are virtually rendered
- The problem is specifically related to CascaderSelect's integration with virtual list functionality

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx
components/virtual-list/virtual-list.jsx
components/cascader/menu.tsx
components/cascader-select/types.ts
components/virtual-list/index.d.ts
```

These files are selected because:
- cascader-select.tsx is the main component where the issue occurs
- virtual-list.jsx contains the core virtual scrolling implementation
- menu.tsx handles the cascading menu rendering and styling
- The type definition files help understand the component interfaces and expected behaviors
- Together these files manage the virtual scrolling and styling behavior of the CascaderSelect component
