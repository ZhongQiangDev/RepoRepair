Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The sorting icon in the table component lacks a cursor pointer style, which reduces the visual indication that it's clickable/interactive.

2. Cause Analysis:
This is likely a CSS styling issue where the cursor property is not properly set for the table's sorting icons. The issue would be in the components that handle table sorting functionality, particularly the base table components and sort-related files.

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
src/table/base/sort.jsx
src/table/base/header.jsx
src/table/base.jsx
src/table/index.jsx
types/table/index.d.ts
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `sort.jsx` directly handles the sorting UI elements and their interactions
- `header.jsx` manages the table header where sort icons are rendered
- `base.jsx` contains core table functionality including sort features
- `index.jsx` exports and configures the table component
- `index.d.ts` defines the TypeScript types for table components including sort-related props

The fix would likely involve adding cursor:pointer CSS styling to the sort icons in either sort.jsx or header.jsx.
