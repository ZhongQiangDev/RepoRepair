I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is about the `imageSmoothing` setting not being respected when using the WebGLTile renderer. Specifically:

1. In the Sea Level example, when zoomed in, there should be a pixelated edge to the sea (corresponding to DEM pixels), but image smoothing is distorting the pixel values.
2. This causes thin lines of "sea" to appear along some contours, especially at 3107 meters.
3. The problem is that the `imageSmoothing: false` setting from the tile source is not being passed to the `TileTexture` in the WebGL renderer, which should use `gl.NEAREST` instead of `gl.LINEAR` for texture filtering.

## Cause Analysis

The WebGLTile renderer is not respecting the `imageSmoothing` property from the tile source. When rendering tiles in WebGL, texture filtering parameters need to be set based on this property:
- When `imageSmoothing` is true, `gl.LINEAR` should be used (default)
- When `imageSmoothing` is false, `gl.NEAREST` should be used

Currently, the renderer is always using `gl.LINEAR`, which causes the smoothing effect even when it's not desired.

## Files to Edit

Based on the repository information and the problem description, these are the most relevant files that need to be modified:

```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```

The primary file to modify would be `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js` to respect the `imageSmoothing` setting when configuring texture filtering. The WebGL tile renderer would need to pass this setting from the source to the texture. The other files are involved in the chain of passing this property from the source to the renderer.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves image smoothing in the WebGLTile renderer. When using a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) with `imageSmoothing: false` setting, the WebGLTile renderer is not respecting this setting. This causes:
- Distortion of pixel values
- Thin lines of "sea" appearing along some contours
- Visual artifacts at tile boundaries when panning

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The root cause appears to be that the WebGLTile renderer is not passing the `imageSmoothing` setting from the tile source to the `TileTexture` class. The `TileTexture` class is using `gl.LINEAR` for texture filtering (`gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER` and `gl.TEXTURE_MAX_FILTER`) instead of using `gl.NEAREST` when `imageSmoothing` is set to `false`.

Currently, only `TileImage` sources support the `imageSmoothing` option, but it's not being properly respected in the WebGL rendering pipeline.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
```

The most important file is `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js` because:
1. It contains the `bindAndConfigure` function that sets the texture filtering parameters
2. It needs to be modified to use `gl.NEAREST` instead of `gl.LINEAR` when `imageSmoothing` is false

The `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` file is important because it contains the `imageSmoothing` property that needs to be properly passed to the WebGL renderer.

The `src/ol/webgl/Helper.js` file may need modifications to ensure the `imageSmoothing` setting is properly passed through the rendering pipeline.
