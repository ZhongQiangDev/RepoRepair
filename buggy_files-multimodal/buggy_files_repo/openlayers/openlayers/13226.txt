I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that "Sources which use view projection with wrapX false do not work with WebGLTileLayer". When changing from `ol/layer/Tile` to `ol/layer/WebGLTile` in the example, the behavior breaks.

The problem appears to be that the WebGL renderer incorrectly expects the source to have a tile grid, but when using a source with view projection and `wrapX: false`, this expectation isn't being met properly.

The issue description mentions that PR #13212 might fix this, suggesting it's related to how WebGLTileLayer handles sources without explicit tile grids or with specific projection settings.

## Cause Analysis

The root cause is likely in how the WebGLTileLayer renderer handles sources that use view projection with wrapX set to false. The renderer is probably not properly checking for or handling this configuration, instead assuming a tile grid is always present or configured in a specific way.

## Most Related Files

Based on the repository information and the problem description, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/tilegrid.js
```

The first two files are most critical as they directly relate to the WebGLTileLayer implementation and its renderer. The TileImage and Tile source files would be relevant for how sources handle the wrapX property. The tilegrid.js file would be important for understanding how tile grids are created and managed, especially when wrapX is false.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The issue is that when changing from `ol/layer/Tile` to `ol/layer/WebGLTile` in a scenario where the source uses view projection with `wrapX: false`, the WebGL renderer incorrectly expects the source to have a tile grid.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
The problem appears to be in how the WebGL tile layer implementation handles sources that don't have an explicit tile grid, particularly when `wrapX` is set to false. The WebGL renderer seems to be making an assumption that all sources have a tile grid, which is not the case for some sources like WMS sources with view projection and `wrapX: false`.

The issue is likely in the WebGL tile layer implementation, specifically in how it processes sources without tile grids. The comment about #13212 potentially fixing this suggests there might be a recent fix for this issue, but a test might be needed to verify the fix works correctly.

## 3. Files most related to the cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/tilegrid/WMTS.js
src/ol/webgl/RenderTarget.js
```

The issue is most likely in the WebGL tile layer implementation, particularly in how it handles tile textures and sources without explicit tile grids. The `TileTexture.js` file is most relevant as it manages WebGL textures for tiles. The `Helper.js` file provides WebGL rendering utilities. The `TileGrid.js` and `WMTS.js` files define how tile grids work, which is directly related to the issue of handling sources without tile grids. Finally, `RenderTarget.js` is involved in the WebGL rendering pipeline for tiles.
