I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue involves clipped VectorTile rendering when:
- The browser is zoomed (e.g., at 150% zoom)
- Using `renderMode: 'image'` for VectorTile layers
- The clipping appears as visible gaps between adjacent tiles

The bug doesn't occur when:
- Browser zoom is at 100%
- Using `renderMode: 'hybrid'` instead of 'image'

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

This appears to be a rendering issue related to how OpenLayers handles pixel calculations when the browser is zoomed. When using `renderMode: 'image'`, vector tiles are rendered to an image canvas, and when the browser is zoomed, there seems to be a mismatch between the calculated tile sizes and the actual rendered sizes, causing gaps between tiles.

The issue is likely related to:
1. How pixel ratios are calculated and applied when the browser is zoomed
2. How vector tiles are rendered in 'image' mode specifically
3. The handling of device pixel ratio vs. browser zoom

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js
src/ol/VectorTile.js
src/ol/VectorRenderTile.js
src/ol/reproj.js
src/ol/render.js
```

The `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js` file is most critical as it handles the rendering of vector tiles in different modes, including the 'image' mode that's causing the issue. This file likely contains the core rendering logic that needs to be adjusted to account for browser zoom.

The `src/ol/VectorTile.js` and `src/ol/VectorRenderTile.js` files manage the vector tile data and rendering preparation, which would be involved in how tiles are processed before rendering.

The `src/ol/reproj.js` file handles reprojection and rendering transformations, which could be related to how pixel calculations are performed.

Finally, `src/ol/render.js` contains utility functions for rendering that might need adjustments to properly handle browser zoom factors.
