I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem occurs when using an Icon style with a custom color on a screen with pixel ratio > 1. The icon's offset becomes incorrect, causing the sprite to display the wrong portion of the image. This only happens when:
1. An offset and size are provided to the icon style
2. The screen pixel ratio is > 1 (high DPI screens)
3. A custom color is applied to the icon style

The issue was introduced in OpenLayers 6.4.0 by PR #11277.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the description and images, the problem appears to be related to how the icon offset is calculated when both a custom color and a high pixel ratio are present. When a custom color is applied to an icon, the library likely creates a new canvas to recolor the icon. During this process, the offset calculation isn't properly accounting for the pixel ratio, causing the wrong portion of the sprite to be displayed.

The issue was introduced in PR #11277, which likely modified how icons with custom colors are processed, but didn't properly handle the interaction with pixel ratio scaling.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js
src/ol/style/IconImage.js
src/ol/render/canvas/ImageBuilder.js
src/ol/colorlike.js
```

The primary issue is likely in `src/ol/style/Icon.js` which handles icon styling and offset calculations. The `IconImageCache.js` and any potential `IconImage.js` would be involved in caching and managing the icon images, including those with custom colors. The `ImageBuilder.js` file handles the rendering of images on the canvas, including the application of styles and offsets. Finally, `colorlike.js` handles color transformations which would be involved when applying custom colors to icons.
