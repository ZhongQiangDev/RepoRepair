I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with KML symbol alignment, placement, and size.

## Analysis of the Problem

1. **Wrong Behavior**: 
   - KML symbols (specifically stars) are not properly aligned with their intended positions
   - The symbols appear to be anchored at the center-bottom instead of their center
   - The symbols appear much larger in OpenLayers than in Google Earth

2. **Cause Analysis**:
   - The issue is related to how OpenLayers handles the anchor point for KML symbols
   - The screenshots show that star symbols should be centered on the red circles, but they're offset
   - This suggests a problem with the KML parsing and rendering logic, specifically how anchor points are calculated and applied to symbols
   - The size discrepancy indicates issues with how symbol scale is interpreted from KML

3. **Most Relevant Files**:
   Based on the repository information, the files most likely responsible for KML symbol handling are:

```
src/ol/format/KML.js
src/ol/style/Icon.js
examples/drag-and-drop-custom-kmz.js
src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
```

The `KML.js` file is most critical as it handles parsing KML data and converting it to OpenLayers features and styles. The `Icon.js` file manages icon styling including anchor points. The example file shows how KML files are loaded and processed. The `IconImageCache.js` and canvas rendering files may be involved in how the symbols are ultimately displayed.
