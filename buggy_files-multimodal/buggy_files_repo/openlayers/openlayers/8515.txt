I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

1. **Wrong Behavior**: When using `ol.select.Interaction`, the selected feature is always shown as the top layer, regardless of the zIndex settings of other layers. Specifically, when a cluster layer is selected, the red dots (hover effect) in a separate layer always appear below the selected feature, even when they should be displayed on top.

2. **Cause Analysis**: This appears to be related to how OpenLayers handles the rendering order of selected features. The `ol.select.Interaction` seems to be applying a special rendering priority to selected features, causing them to always render on top of other features regardless of the configured zIndex values of their respective layers.

3. **Key Files to Edit**: Based on the repository information, the following files are most likely responsible for this behavior:

```
src/ol/interaction/Select.js
src/ol/renderer/vector.js
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
```

The `Select.js` file is the most critical as it directly implements the selection interaction and likely contains the logic that determines how selected features are rendered. The `renderer/vector.js` file handles the actual rendering of vector features, while the layer files manage the z-index and rendering order of layers. These files together control how features are displayed and their stacking order.
