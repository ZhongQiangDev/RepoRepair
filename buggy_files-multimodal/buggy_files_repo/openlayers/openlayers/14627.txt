I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem occurs when `applyTransform` is called on an empty extent (created with `createEmpty()`). This results in an extent with NaN values, which then causes an error when used with `fit` on a map view.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is in the `applyTransform` function when it's used with an empty extent. An empty extent is represented as `[Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]`. When this is transformed using `getTransform('EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:3857')`, the transformation function (specifically `fromEPSG4326`) tries to apply mathematical operations like `Math.tan` on `Infinity`, which results in `NaN`. 

The error occurs because `Math.tan(Infinity)` is `NaN` in JavaScript, and this NaN propagates through the calculations, resulting in an invalid extent.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```

src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
src/ol/proj/transforms.js
src/ol/proj.js
```

The issue is primarily in the interaction between the extent transformation functions and the EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 transformation. The `applyTransform` function in `extent.js` needs to handle empty extents properly, and the transformation function in `epsg3857.js` needs to handle Infinity values correctly.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem occurs when `applyTransform` is called on an empty extent and then used with `map.getView().fit()`. This results in NaN values in the transformed extent, which causes an error when trying to fit the view to this invalid extent.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue is in the transformation function returned by `getTransform('EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:3857')`. Specifically, when an empty extent (which contains `Infinity` values) is passed to this transform function, the `Math.tan` operation inside the transform converts `Infinity` to `NaN`. This happens because the transformation from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 involves a Mercator projection which uses tangent calculations.

The core issue is that the transformation function doesn't properly handle the edge case of an empty extent with `Infinity` values.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/proj.js
src/ol/extent.js
src/ol/proj/transforms.js
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
src/ol/proj/Projection.js
```

The most important files are:

1. `src/ol/proj.js` - This is likely where the `getTransform` function is defined, which returns the transformation function that's causing the issue.

2. `src/ol/extent.js` - This contains the `applyTransform` function and likely the `createEmpty` function that creates an extent with `Infinity` values.

3. `src/ol/proj/transforms.js` - This probably contains the implementation of the transformation functions between different projections.

4. `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js` - This would contain the specific implementation of the EPSG:3857 projection, including the transformation that uses `Math.tan` which is converting `Infinity` to `NaN`.

5. `src/ol/proj/Projection.js` - This likely defines the base projection class and may contain methods related to transformations.
