I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that `drawFeature()` is not working correctly with geographic coordinates when Null Island (0,0) is out of view. The animation becomes invisible when the map is panned so that Null Island is no longer in the viewport, but using `setStyle`/`drawGeometry` instead of `drawFeature` works correctly.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the description, this appears to be an issue with an incorrect extent comparison in the `drawFeature()` method. The problem description mentions that this comparison is redundant since it's already performed in the subsequent `drawGeometry` call. The comparison in `drawCircle` also needs fixing.

This suggests that there's an extent check in `drawFeature()` that incorrectly determines whether a feature should be drawn based on its relationship to the current view extent. When Null Island (coordinates 0,0) is out of view, this check is incorrectly preventing features from being drawn, even when they should be visible.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Looking at the repository information, the most relevant files would be those related to vector context and drawing features. The issue is specifically with the `drawFeature()` method and its extent comparison logic.

```
src/ol/render/VectorContext.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
src/ol/extent.js
src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js
src/ol/geom/flat/intersectsextent.js
```

The primary issue is likely in `src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js` which would contain the implementation of the `drawFeature()` method with the problematic extent check. The `VectorContext.js` file defines the interface that includes `drawFeature()`. The `extent.js` file would contain utilities for extent comparisons that might be used incorrectly. The `hitdetect.js` and `intersectsextent.js` files are related to determining if geometries intersect with extents, which is central to this issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The issue is that `drawFeature()` is not working correctly with geographic coordinates when Null Island (coordinates 0,0) is not in view. The animation example shows that when the map is panned so Null Island goes out of view, the animation disappears. However, using `setStyle`/`drawGeometry` instead of `drawFeature` allows the animation to remain visible.

The problem description mentions an "incorrect extent comparison" in `drawFeature()` that's redundant because it's repeated in the subsequent `drawGeometry` call. This suggests there's an unnecessary or incorrect check in the `drawFeature` method that's preventing features from being drawn when they should be.

## Analyzing the Cause

Based on the description, the issue appears to be in the vector rendering code, specifically in the WebGL vector renderer. The problem involves:

1. An extent comparison in `drawFeature()` that incorrectly determines whether a feature should be drawn
2. This check is redundant because `drawGeometry()` (which is called by `drawFeature()`) already performs a similar check
3. The issue only occurs with geographic coordinates when Null Island (0,0) is not in view

This suggests the problem is in the WebGL vector rendering code, particularly in the `VectorContext` implementation that handles the `drawFeature()` method.

## Most Relevant Files

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/VectorLayer.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/VectorTileLayer.js
src/ol/webgl/TileGeometry.js
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
src/ol/extent.js
```

The most important file is likely `src/ol/renderer/webgl/VectorLayer.js` as it would contain the WebGL implementation of the vector layer renderer, which would include the `drawFeature()` method with the problematic extent comparison.

The second file, `src/ol/renderer/webgl/VectorTileLayer.js`, is also important as it might share code or patterns with the vector layer renderer and could be affected by the same issue.

`src/ol/webgl/TileGeometry.js` is relevant because it handles the geometry data for WebGL rendering and might be involved in the extent comparison logic.

`src/ol/webgl/Helper.js` provides utility functions for WebGL rendering and might contain helper methods used in the extent comparison.

Finally, `src/ol/extent.js` likely contains the utility functions for extent comparisons that are being used incorrectly in the `drawFeature()` method.
