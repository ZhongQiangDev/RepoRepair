I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the performance issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves poor performance when using `renderMode: 'image'` in OpenLayers 4.6.2 compared to using `ol.source.ImageVector` in OpenLayers 4.4.2. Specifically, drawing triangles is very slow in the newer version, as demonstrated by the provided CodePen examples.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue stems from the deprecation of `ol.source.ImageVector` in OpenLayers 4.6.0 and its replacement with `renderMode: 'image'` for vector layers. Based on the repository information, this likely involves inefficiencies in how vector features are rendered to an image canvas in the new implementation.

The performance degradation is specifically related to drawing operations, suggesting issues with the canvas rendering pipeline, vector-to-image conversion, or how drawing interactions are handled in the new implementation.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/source/imagevector.js
src/ol/render/canvas/immediate.js
src/ol/render/canvas/vectorlayer.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js
src/ol/render/canvas/replay.js
```

These files are most critical to fixing the issue because:

1. `src/ol/source/imagevector.js` - This is the deprecated class that worked well in 4.4.2. Understanding its implementation will help identify what's missing in the new approach.

2. `src/ol/render/canvas/immediate.js` - Handles immediate mode rendering of vector features to canvas, which is likely involved in the new `renderMode: 'image'` implementation.

3. `src/ol/render/canvas/vectorlayer.js` - Contains rendering logic for vector layers, which would be central to the new `renderMode: 'image'` implementation.

4. `src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js` - Implements the canvas renderer for vector layers, including the preparation and composition of frames, which would be critical for the image rendering mode.

5. `src/ol/render/canvas/replay.js` - Manages the core rendering pipeline for canvas, including coordinate transformation and instruction processing, which could be a bottleneck in the new implementation.
