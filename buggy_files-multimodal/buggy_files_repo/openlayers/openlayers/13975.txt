I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves `ol.style.icon` where there appears to be an unexpected interaction between the `scale` and `displacement` properties. Specifically, when the scale of an icon is changed, the Y position of the icon also changes, even though the user expects icons with different scales to maintain the same Y position at their bottom edges.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue likely stems from how the displacement property interacts with scaling in the OpenLayers Icon style. When an icon is scaled, the displacement is applied after scaling, which means the displacement value itself is not scaled proportionally. This creates the behavior where icons with different scales appear at different vertical positions, even when the user attempts to align them by their bottom edges.

The displacement property is likely applied relative to the anchor point, and when scaling changes the size of the icon, the displacement remains constant in absolute pixels rather than being adjusted relative to the scaled size.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
src/ol/style/IconImage.js
src/ol/style/Image.js
src/ol/transform.js
src/ol/style/flat.js
```

The `src/ol/style/Icon.js` file is most critical as it directly implements the Icon style class that handles both scale and displacement properties. The `IconImage.js` and `Image.js` files provide the base functionality that Icon extends. The `transform.js` file contains transformation functions that would be used when applying scale and displacement. Finally, `style/flat.js` provides utility functions for style conversion that might influence how these properties are processed.
