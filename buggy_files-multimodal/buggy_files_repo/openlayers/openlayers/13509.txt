I'll analyze the WebGLTile visibility issue and identify the most relevant files.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that when a WebGLTile layer is placed inside a group layer, setting the group's visibility to false doesn't hide the WebGLTile layer. This behavior is inconsistent with other layer types like Tile layers, which do become hidden when their parent group's visibility is set to false.

## Analyzing the Cause
This suggests an issue with how visibility is propagated from group layers to WebGLTile layers. The problem likely lies in one of these areas:
1. The Layer class hierarchy and how visibility is managed
2. How WebGLTile layers specifically handle visibility changes
3. How LayerGroup manages and propagates visibility to its children

The key issue appears to be that WebGLTile layers aren't properly respecting their parent group's visibility setting. This could be due to:
- Missing event handling for visibility changes
- Incorrect visibility calculation in the rendering pipeline
- WebGLTile-specific rendering logic that bypasses normal visibility checks

src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/PluggableMap.js
```

The issue is most likely in how WebGLTile layers interact with their parent groups and how visibility is calculated during rendering. The `Layer.js` file contains the base visibility logic, `Group.js` handles propagation to child layers, `WebGLTile.js` contains the specific implementation that's not respecting group visibility, and `renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` handles the actual rendering where visibility checks might be bypassed. Finally, `PluggableMap.js` orchestrates the rendering pipeline where this issue might manifest.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves a WebGlTile layer inside a Group layer. When the Group's visibility is set to false, the WebGlTile layer remains visible, which is incorrect. This doesn't happen with regular Tile layers, which correctly become hidden when their parent Group's visibility is set to false.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

This suggests there's an issue with how visibility propagation works specifically for WebGlTile layers within layer groups. The visibility property of a Group should cascade to all its child layers, but this isn't happening for WebGlTile layers.

The issue is likely in the rendering pipeline or visibility handling code that's specific to WebGlTile layers. Since regular Tile layers work correctly, there's probably a missing check or implementation in the WebGlTile-specific code that should respect the parent group's visibility.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/layer/WebGlTile.js
src/ol/layer/Group.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/Layer.js
src/ol/renderer/Layer.js
```

Note: Since the repository information doesn't include these specific files, I've inferred their likely names based on the problem description and typical OpenLayers architecture. The actual fix would involve checking how visibility is propagated from Group layers to their children, and ensuring WebGlTile layers properly respect their parent Group's visibility setting.
