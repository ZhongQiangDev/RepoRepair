I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that when the map is rotated, the vector layer canvas is cropped/cut off. This issue was introduced in version 9.1.0, likely by PR #15652. The screenshots show that when the map is not rotated, a large polygon displays correctly, but when rotated, parts of the polygon are cut off.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the description, this is a rendering issue specifically affecting vector layers when the map is rotated. The problem appears to be related to incorrect canvas sizing or transformation when rotation is applied. The canvas size is not properly adjusted to accommodate the rotated content, resulting in clipping.

Since the issue was introduced by a specific PR (#15652), it's likely related to changes in how the canvas size or transformation is calculated for vector layers during rotation.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Builder.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js
src/ol/transform.js
src/ol/layer/VectorImage.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorImageLayer.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/render/canvas/Builder.js` - Handles canvas rendering instructions and extent calculations for vector geometries, which would be critical for determining the proper canvas size.

2. `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js` - Manages the rendering of vector layers on canvas, including frame composition and transformations.

3. `src/ol/transform.js` - Contains transformation utilities that would be used during rotation operations.

4. `src/ol/layer/VectorImage.js` - Defines the vector image layer class which would be affected by the rotation issue.

5. `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorImageLayer.js` - Handles the specific rendering logic for vector image layers, including coordinate transformations that would be critical during rotation.
