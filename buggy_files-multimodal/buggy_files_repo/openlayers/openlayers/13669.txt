I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with GeoTIFF handling NaN no-data values.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue involves a GeoTIFF with NaN as the no-data value. When retrieving pixel data via the `getData` method, the alpha channel is not being set correctly. The user gets `[NaN, NaN, NaN, 255]` (fully opaque) instead of the expected `[NaN, NaN, NaN, 0]` (fully transparent) for no-data pixels.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be in how the GeoTIFF source handles NaN no-data values. When a pixel contains NaN values, the code should recognize these as no-data pixels and set the alpha channel to 0 (transparent). However, it seems the comparison with NaN is not working correctly, which is a common issue in JavaScript since `NaN !== NaN`.

The issue is likely in the GeoTIFF source implementation where it:
1. Reads the pixel data from the GeoTIFF
2. Compares pixel values with the no-data value
3. Sets the alpha channel based on this comparison

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant files would be:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/DataTile.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/layer/BaseTile.js
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
```

The `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js` file is likely the primary file that needs to be modified, as it would contain the logic for handling GeoTIFF data and no-data values. The issue is probably in how it processes the pixel data and sets the alpha channel when encountering NaN values.

The other files are related to tile handling, data processing, and rendering, which might need adjustments to properly support NaN no-data values throughout the rendering pipeline.
