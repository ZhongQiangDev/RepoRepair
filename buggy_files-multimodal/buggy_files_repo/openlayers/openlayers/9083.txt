I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem described is that after drawing a polygon on an OpenLayers map (specifically after the "drawend" event), the user sometimes cannot drag the map anymore. This issue appears to be:
- Inconsistent/random in occurrence
- Only happens after completing a drawing (drawend event)
- Does not occur when using OpenLayers 4.6.5 (only in 5.3.0)
- The setup uses "altkeyonly" condition

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the description and the GIF demonstration, this appears to be an event handling issue in OpenLayers 5.3.0. After a polygon drawing is completed, something is preventing the normal drag functionality from working. This could be related to:

1. Event listeners not being properly cleaned up after drawing ends
2. Interaction conflicts between the drawing tool and the map drag functionality
3. Issues with the "altkeyonly" condition not being properly reset or evaluated
4. Problems with pointer event handling after the drawing interaction completes

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these files are most likely related to the issue:

```
src/ol/MapBrowserPointerEvent.js
src/ol/events.js
examples/draw-features.js
examples/draw-and-modify-features.js
src/ol/interaction.js
```

The issue is most likely in the core event handling system (MapBrowserPointerEvent.js and events.js) which manages pointer events and their propagation. The draw-features.js and draw-and-modify-features.js examples demonstrate similar functionality to what's described in the bug report. The interaction.js file handles the coordination between different interactions like drawing and dragging, which is central to this issue.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem described is that after drawing a polygon using OpenLayers 5.3.0, the user sometimes cannot drag the map anymore. This issue:
- Only happens after ending a drawing (drawend event)
- Occurs randomly (not consistently reproducible)
- Doesn't happen in OpenLayers 4.6.5 (older version)
- The setup uses the "altkeyonly" condition for map interactions

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the description and the GIF, this appears to be an issue with event handling after completing a polygon drawing. When a drawing is completed, something is preventing the map's drag functionality from working properly. This is likely related to:

1. The interaction between the Draw interaction and other map interactions
2. Event propagation or handling after the drawend event
3. The condition used for dragging (altkeyonly)
4. Pointer event management

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/interaction/Draw.js
src/ol/events/condition.js
src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js
src/ol/pointer/PointerEventHandler.js
src/ol/interaction/DragBox.js
```

The issue is most likely in the Draw interaction, which might not be properly cleaning up event handlers or state after drawing ends. The events/condition.js file contains the altkeyonly condition mentioned in the problem. The Pointer.js and PointerEventHandler.js files handle the core pointer event management that would affect dragging. Finally, DragBox.js is included as it's related to drag interactions that might be affected by the issue.
