I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

1. **Wrong behavior**: Character codes like `&amp;apos;` are appearing in labels instead of being decoded to their proper characters (e.g., `Andy's` is showing as `Andy&apos;s`).

2. **Cause**: XML entities in text content (from KML or other XML-based formats) are not being properly decoded when rendered as labels on the map. The XML parser correctly preserves these entities in the data, but they need to be decoded before being displayed as text in the UI.

3. **Related files**: Looking at the repository information, I need to find files that handle:
   - Text rendering/styling
   - XML entity decoding
   - Label processing

## Files That Need Editing

```
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
src/ol/style/Text.js
src/ol/format/KML.js
src/ol/xml.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js` - This is likely the primary file that handles text rendering on canvas, including processing text content before drawing it.

2. `src/ol/style/Text.js` - This file would define the Text style class that manages how text is displayed, including any text processing before rendering.

3. `src/ol/format/KML.js` - Since the issue was specifically mentioned with KML files, this parser might need to handle entity decoding.

4. `src/ol/xml.js` - This contains core XML utilities that might need to include entity decoding functionality.

5. `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js` - This file executes rendering instructions, including text rendering, and might need to be modified to decode entities.
