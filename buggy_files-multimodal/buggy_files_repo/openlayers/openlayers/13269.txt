I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that the `gutter` option in `ol/source/TileWMS` is not compatible with `ol/layer/WebGLTile`. When using a WebGLTile layer renderer with a TileWMS source that has a gutter, the renderer doesn't clip the image gutter before creating textures, resulting in misplacement and duplication of the rendered content.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue occurs because:
1. The `ol/source/TileWMS` class supports a gutter option that adds extra pixels around each tile to prevent rendering artifacts at tile boundaries.
2. When used with regular `ol/layer/Tile`, these gutters are properly clipped.
3. However, when used with `ol/layer/WebGLTile`, the WebGL renderer doesn't clip the gutter pixels before creating textures, causing visual issues.
4. The WebGLTile renderer needs to be modified to handle the gutter property from TileWMS sources, similar to how the canvas renderer does.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/layer/BaseTile.js
```

The most important file is `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` as it defines the WebGLTile layer that needs to be modified to handle gutters. The second most important is `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` which contains the WebGL rendering logic that needs to be updated to clip the gutter before creating textures.

The `src/ol/source/TileWMS.js` file is important as it contains the gutter implementation that's causing the issue. `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` is the parent class of TileWMS and may contain relevant code for handling gutters. Finally, `src/ol/layer/BaseTile.js` is the base class for tile layers and may need modifications to properly pass gutter information to the WebGL renderer.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves the `ol/layer/WebGLTile` layer renderer not properly handling the "gutter" option from `ol/source/TileWMS`. The gutter is extra pixels added around WMS tiles to prevent rendering artifacts at tile boundaries. While this works correctly with `ol/layer/Tile`, the WebGLTile renderer doesn't clip the gutter before creating textures, resulting in misplacement and duplication of content.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue occurs because:
1. When using WMS tiles with a gutter, extra pixels are added around each tile
2. The `ol/layer/Tile` renderer correctly handles this by clipping the gutter
3. The `ol/layer/WebGLTile` renderer doesn't clip the gutter before creating WebGL textures
4. This causes visual artifacts (misplacement and duplication) when rendering the tiles

The core of the issue is in how WebGL textures are created from tile images, particularly when those tiles have gutters. The WebGLTile renderer needs to be modified to handle the gutter option similar to how the regular Tile renderer does.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```

The `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js` file is most critical as it handles uploading tile images to WebGL textures and would need to be modified to handle the gutter clipping. The `src/ol/source/TileWMS.js` file defines the gutter option that's not being properly handled. The `src/ol/webgl/Helper.js` provides WebGL utilities that might be involved in texture creation. The `src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js` handles tile grid configuration which is relevant to understanding how tiles are positioned. Finally, `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` would be the layer implementation that needs to respect the gutter option.
