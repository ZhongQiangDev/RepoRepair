I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves a change in tile request timing behavior between OpenLayers versions 6.1 and 7.0. In version 6.1, tile requests for layers in a LayerGroup were sent concurrently, allowing imagery to load quickly. After upgrading to version 7.0, the requests became sequential (one at a time), significantly slowing down the imagery loading process.

## Analyzing the Cause
This behavior change suggests a modification in how tile loading is managed for layers within a LayerGroup. The issue is likely related to:
1. How LayerGroup manages its child layers
2. How tile loading is prioritized or queued
3. Changes in the tile loading strategy or queue management

The problem appears to be a regression in performance rather than a bug, as the tiles still load correctly but in a less efficient manner.

```
src/ol/TileQueue.js
src/ol/layer/Group.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/TileCache.js
src/ol/Tile.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `src/ol/TileQueue.js` - This file manages the queue of tiles to be loaded, including the `loadMoreTiles` function which controls how many tiles are loaded simultaneously. Changes here could affect the concurrency of tile loading.

2. `src/ol/layer/Group.js` - This file handles how layer groups manage their child layers, including how rendering and loading states are propagated. Changes in how a LayerGroup processes its children could affect loading behavior.

3. `src/ol/source/Tile.js` - This file contains the base class for tile sources, which would be responsible for initiating tile loading requests. Changes here could affect how tiles are requested.

4. `src/ol/TileCache.js` - This file manages caching of tiles, which could impact the loading strategy if changes were made to how tiles are prioritized or managed in the cache.

5. `src/ol/Tile.js` - This file contains the base Tile class which handles individual tile loading states and events. Changes to the core tile loading behavior would be here.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves a change in tile loading behavior between OpenLayers versions 6.1 and 7.0. In version 6.1, tile requests for layers within a LayerGroup were sent concurrently, resulting in faster imagery loading. After upgrading to version 7.0, the requests are being sent sequentially (one at a time), causing a significant slowdown in imagery loading times.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the screenshots and description, this appears to be a change in how tile requests are scheduled or prioritized within a LayerGroup. The issue is likely related to how the tile loading queue is managed or how priorities are assigned to tiles from different layers within the same group.

## Most Related Files

```
src/ol/structs/PriorityQueue.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/source/UrlTile.js
src/ol/layer/Group.js
```

The issue is most likely in the priority queue implementation that manages tile loading. The `PriorityQueue.js` file contains the logic for prioritizing which tiles get loaded first. The `Tile.js` and related source files handle the actual tile loading process and interact with the priority queue. The `layer/Group.js` file would contain the logic for how layers within a group are managed, which could affect how their tiles are scheduled for loading.

The change in behavior suggests that in version 7.0, tiles from the same layer are being given priority over tiles from different layers within the same group, causing the sequential loading pattern instead of the concurrent loading seen in version 6.1.
