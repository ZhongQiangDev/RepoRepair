I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The GitHub issue describes that when customizing the `className` of a heatmap layer, it doesn't work, and the default className is not displayed on the page. The screenshot shows a heatmap visualization, but apparently the custom class name setting isn't being applied properly.

Looking at the repository information, this is related to the OpenLayers library, specifically the heatmap layer functionality. The issue is likely that when setting a custom `className` property on a heatmap layer, this property is either not being applied to the DOM element or not being processed correctly.

## Cause of the Issue

After reviewing the code descriptions, I can see that the `ol.layer.Heatmap` class extends `ol.layer.Vector` and handles rendering of heatmap layers. The issue is likely that while the `className` property is being set, it's not being properly applied to the DOM element that represents the heatmap layer.

The `className` property is typically used to apply CSS classes to layer DOM elements, but in the case of the heatmap layer, this functionality appears to be broken or not implemented correctly.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

```
src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js
src/ol/Map.js
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js` since it contains the implementation of the heatmap layer and likely needs to be updated to properly handle the className property.

The `src/ol/layer/Base.js` and `src/ol/layer/Layer.js` files are also important as they likely contain the base implementation for handling layer properties including className.

The `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js` file may need modifications if the rendering process is not correctly applying the className.

Finally, `src/ol/Map.js` might need changes if there's an issue with how the map handles layer DOM elements and their class names.
