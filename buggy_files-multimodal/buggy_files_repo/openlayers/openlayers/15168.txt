I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with raster reprojection.

## Analysis of the Problem

1. **Wrong Behavior**: When reprojecting a raster image (5×5 pixels), OpenLayers is creating a result that appears to be 7×5 pixels. The source pixels are being stretched horizontally, causing misalignment with the expected centers (marked by blue circles in the screenshot).

2. **Cause**: OpenLayers is assuming that projected pixels should be square in the target projection. This causes distortion when the source pixels have non-square dimensions (in this case, 3km by 2km). Instead of preserving the original pixel count, the reprojection is adding extra pixels to maintain square shapes in the target projection.

3. **Expected Behavior**: The reprojection should preserve the exact number of source pixels (5×5) and allow them to be non-square in the target projection, ensuring they align with their expected centers.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/reproj.js
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
src/ol/reproj/Triangulation.js
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js
```

The issue is primarily in the reprojection logic, which is handled by these files. The `reproj.js` file contains core reprojection functions, while the other files handle specific aspects of reprojection for different types of data (images, tiles, etc.). The fix would likely involve modifying how the reprojection calculates target dimensions and handles pixel aspect ratios during transformation.
