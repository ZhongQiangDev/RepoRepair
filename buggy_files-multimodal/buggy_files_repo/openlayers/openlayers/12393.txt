I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves a rounding error in `ImageStatic` when scaling an image to fit an extent. According to the description, a perfectly square image should fit into a square tile extent, but due to floating point calculations and the use of `Math.ceil()`, the image is being stretched unnecessarily. The problem appears to be that the code is rounding up dimensions, which might be intended to prevent zero width when scaling is negative, but it's causing distortion in normal cases.

The user suggests that a better approach would be to always scale up whichever dimension needs it instead of reducing width, and to round to the nearest pixel instead of using `.ceil()`.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information and the problem description, the most relevant files are:

```
src/ol/source/ImageStatic.js
src/ol/Image.js
src/ol/ImageBase.js
```

The primary issue is in the `ImageStatic.js` file, which handles static images and their scaling to fit extents. The `Image.js` file likely contains the core image handling logic including dimension calculations. The `ImageBase.js` file provides the base functionality that both of these files extend from.

The problem specifically mentions the `handleImageChange` method which is likely in one of these files, where the image dimensions are calculated and adjusted when an image is loaded.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue involves rounding errors in the `ImageStatic` source when scaling an image to fit a given extent. Specifically, a perfectly square image should fit into a square tile extent, but due to floating point calculations and the use of `Math.ceil()`, the image is being unnecessarily stretched.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The problem appears to be in the code that calculates the dimensions of an image when scaling it to fit an extent. The use of `Math.ceil()` is causing rounding up, which leads to stretching. The issue mentions that this might be intended to prevent zero width when scaling is negative, but it's causing undesired stretching in normal cases. The suggested fix is to scale up whichever dimension needs it instead of reducing width, and to round to the nearest pixel rather than always rounding up.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant files would be those dealing with image rendering, static images, and coordinate transformations. Since the issue specifically mentions `ImageStatic`, I need to look for files that handle static image sources and their rendering.

```
src/ol/source/ImageStatic.js
src/ol/source/Image.js
src/ol/ImageCanvas.js
src/ol/ImageBase.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js
```

Note: While `ImageStatic.js` isn't explicitly listed in the repository information you provided, it must exist since the issue specifically mentions the `ImageStatic` class. The other files are inferred based on the OpenLayers architecture and the nature of the problem, which involves image rendering and scaling.
