I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with shapes in Draw interaction when useGeographic is specified.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves:
1. Drawn circles and custom geometry not having the expected shape/size when `useGeographic` is specified
2. Circles not extending to the pointer position as they would in non-geographic mode
3. Regular shapes (created by `createRegularPolygon`) appearing distorted, especially in higher latitudes
4. Box shapes (created by `createBox`) not working correctly when the view projection is not parallel to WGS84

This is a projection-related issue. When `useGeographic` is enabled, the map uses the EPSG:4326 (WGS84) geographic coordinate system where coordinates are in degrees (longitude/latitude). The problem is that the Draw interaction's geometry creation functions (`createRegularPolygon`, `createBox`) are creating shapes that don't account for the distortion that occurs in geographic coordinates, especially at higher latitudes.

In a geographic coordinate system, one degree of longitude varies in actual distance depending on the latitude (it gets smaller as you move toward the poles), while one degree of latitude remains relatively constant. This means that drawing a "square" with equal degree measurements will actually create a rectangle that gets more compressed in the east-west direction as you move away from the equator.

## Files That Need to Be Modified

```
src/ol/interaction/Draw.js
src/ol/proj.js
src/ol/geom/Circle.js
src/ol/geom/Geometry.js
src/ol/geom/flat/geodesic.js
```

These files are the most critical to fix the issue:

1. `src/ol/interaction/Draw.js` - Contains the implementation of the Draw interaction, including the `createRegularPolygon` and `createBox` functions that need to be modified to account for geographic coordinates.

2. `src/ol/proj.js` - Contains the `useGeographic` function and projection utilities that need to be considered when drawing shapes in geographic mode.

3. `src/ol/geom/Circle.js` - Implements the Circle geometry which is not extending correctly to the pointer position in geographic mode.

4. `src/ol/geom/Geometry.js` - Base class for geometries that may need adjustments for proper handling of geographic coordinates.

5. `src/ol/geom/flat/geodesic.js` - Contains utilities for geodesic calculations which could be used to create proper shapes on a sphere rather than on a flat plane.
