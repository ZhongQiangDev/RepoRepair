I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the regression with `textAlign` 'start' and 'end' values.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem description mentions a regression with the `Text` style's `textAlign` property, specifically with the 'start' and 'end' values. In the test case `test/rendering/cases/text-style-linestring-nice`, texts labeled 'Small text' and 'negative offsetX' are aligned at the wrong end.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

This suggests that there's an issue with how the 'start' and 'end' values of `textAlign` are being processed. These values are part of the CSS text-align property and are direction-aware alternatives to 'left' and 'right':
- 'start' should align text to the start of the line (left in LTR languages, right in RTL)
- 'end' should align text to the end of the line (right in LTR languages, left in RTL)

The issue is likely in the code that handles text alignment in the OpenLayers library, specifically in how these values are interpreted or converted when rendering text on a canvas.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
src/ol/style/Text.js
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
examples/vector-labels-justify-text.js
examples/rich-text-labels.js
```

The `Executor.js` file contains an alignment handling function that specifically deals with converting 'start' and 'end' values, which is directly related to the issue. The `Text.js` file defines the text style class with methods for setting and getting text alignment. The `TextBuilder.js` file handles text rendering on canvas. The example files demonstrate text alignment usage and could help verify the fix.
