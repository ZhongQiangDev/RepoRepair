I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The problem has two parts:
1. **Hit detection doesn't work** when an icon has negative scale and 0 rotation
2. **Icon is not rendered at the edge of the map** when it has negative scale

This suggests issues with how OpenLayers handles negative icon scaling, specifically affecting both the hit detection logic and the rendering behavior at map edges.

## Cause Analysis

The issue likely stems from how the library processes negative scale values in icons:
- For hit detection, the negative scale might be causing incorrect calculations for determining if a click/pointer is within the icon's bounds
- For rendering at map edges, the negative scale might be affecting how the library determines which parts of the icon should be clipped when it's partially outside the viewport

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js
src/ol/style.js
src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
src/ol/render.js
src/ol/renderer/Map.js
```

The `hitdetect.js` file is likely responsible for the hit detection functionality that's failing with negative scale. The `ExecutorGroup.js` and `render.js` files would handle the rendering logic, including how elements are clipped at map edges. The `style.js` file (though not explicitly shown in the repository info) would contain the icon style definition that needs to handle negative scale values properly. Finally, `renderer/Map.js` coordinates the overall rendering process and would be involved in both issues.
