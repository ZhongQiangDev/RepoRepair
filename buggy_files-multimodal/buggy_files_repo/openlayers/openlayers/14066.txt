I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be modified to implement the requested feature.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is not about wrong behavior but a feature request: adding a `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option for GeoTIFF sources. Currently, there's no automatic conversion of GeoTIFF images with specific photometric interpretations (CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab) to RGB.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The request suggests implementing an 'auto' option that would use the `image.readRGB()` method when a GeoTIFF source has 3 samples per pixel and a photometric interpretation of CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab. This would automatically convert these color spaces to RGB for proper display.

Currently, this conversion must be explicitly requested, but having an 'auto' option would simplify usage and potentially become the default in a future breaking release.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
examples/cog-colors.js
examples/cog-blob.js
```

The primary file is `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js` which would need to be modified to add the 'auto' option and implement the logic to detect photometric interpretation and sample count. The `TileTexture.js` and `WebGLTile.js` files may need adjustments to handle the converted RGB data properly. The example files would be useful for testing and demonstrating the new feature.
