I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior

The problem involves WebGLTile Layers in OpenLayers and the need to support a specific blending function (`gl.ONE, gl.ONE`) for a subset of tile layers. Currently, there's no way to specify different blending functions for different WebGL tile layers.

## 2. Analyzing the cause

The issue is that OpenLayers' WebGLTile implementation doesn't provide a way to customize the WebGL blending function. The blending function is likely hardcoded in the WebGL helper or rendering code. The developers need to add a flag or parameter to the WebGLTileLayer style to change this blending function.

The problem description mentions that the blending function is set in `src/ol/webgl/Helper.js` at lines 485-488, but there's no way to customize it from the WebGLTile layer API.

## 3. Files most related to the cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified:

```
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
src/ol/render/webgl/TileLayer.js
```

The `webgl/Helper.js` file contains the hardcoded blending function that needs to be made configurable. The `layer/WebGLTile.js` file would need to be modified to accept a blending function parameter in its style options. The renderer and source files would need to be updated to pass this parameter through to the WebGL helper during rendering.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves WebGLTile Layers in OpenLayers that need to support a specific blending mode (`gl.ONE, gl.ONE`) for a subset of tile layers. Currently, there's no way to configure different blending options for WebGL rendering in OpenLayers.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue is that OpenLayers' WebGL rendering system uses a fixed blending function (`gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)`) as mentioned in the problem description. This is hardcoded in the WebGL Helper class, specifically at `https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/main/src/ol/webgl/Helper.js#L485-L488`. 

The application needs to be able to specify different blending functions for different tile layers, particularly using `gl.ONE, gl.ONE` for some layers, which would allow for additive blending rather than the default alpha blending.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most important files that would need to be modified:

```
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/source/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/style/Style.js
```

Note: While `src/ol/source/WebGLTile.js` and `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` aren't in the provided repository information, they would likely be critical files for implementing this feature since they would contain the WebGLTile implementation that needs the blending option. The `src/ol/webgl/Helper.js` file is definitely the primary file that needs modification as it contains the hardcoded blending function. The other files would need changes to pass the blending option from the layer style to the WebGL rendering pipeline.
