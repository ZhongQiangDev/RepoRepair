I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue described is that when zooming in and out on a map with a reprojected Tile layer, white areas sometimes appear. This happens because the underlying Tile object has been disposed and is therefore excluded from the stitching process during reprojection.

The key insight is that tiles in the `ABORT` state are being excluded from the reprojection process. The user mentions that simply modifying the loop in `ol.reproj.Tile` to include tiles in the `ABORT` state doesn't work, suggesting that these tiles should not be disposed or should be refetched instead.

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause appears to be in the reprojection logic for tiles. When tiles are in the `ABORT` state, they're being excluded from the stitching process that creates the source canvas for reprojection. However, simply including these tiles isn't sufficient because they've been disposed, meaning their data is no longer available.

The solution likely involves either:
1. Preventing tiles from being disposed when they might still be needed for reprojection
2. Ensuring that tiles in the `ABORT` state are refetched if needed for reprojection
3. Modifying the reprojection logic to handle disposed tiles appropriately

## Most Relevant Files

Based on the repository information and the problem description, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
src/ol/Tile.js
src/ol/reproj.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js
```

The `src/ol/reproj/Tile.js` file is likely the most important as it directly handles tile reprojection. The `src/ol/Tile.js` file would contain the base tile functionality including disposal logic. The `src/ol/reproj.js` file contains the reprojection utilities. The `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` and `src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js` files handle tile loading and rendering, which are relevant to the issue of tiles being disposed and not available for reprojection.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves white areas appearing on a map when zooming in and out on a reprojected Tile layer. These white areas occur because some Tile objects have been disposed and are therefore excluded from the stitching process when creating the source canvas for reprojection.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue appears to be related to tile management during reprojection. When tiles are in an ABORT state, they're being disposed of, but they should either not be disposed or should be refetched when needed for reprojection. The problem specifically mentions "ol.reproj.Tile" which would be handling the reprojection of tiles from one coordinate system to another.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant files would be those dealing with tile management, reprojection, and rendering. Since the issue specifically mentions tiles being disposed and excluded from stitching during reprojection, I need to identify files that handle these processes.

```
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/source/XYZ.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
src/ol/Tile.js
```

Note: While "src/ol/reproj/Tile.js" is mentioned in the problem description and would be the most relevant file, it wasn't included in the repository information you provided. I've included it in my answer as it would be critical to examine. Similarly, "src/ol/Tile.js" would be important but wasn't in the provided files. The files I've listed from the available information are those most likely to be related to tile management and reprojection.
