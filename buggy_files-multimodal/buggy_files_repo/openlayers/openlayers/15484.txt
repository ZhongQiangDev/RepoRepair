I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that when a GeoTIFF source is reprojected, the `wrapX` option (which is actually used to crop the output to the tile grid extent on both x and y axes) is not being respected. This is causing the GeoTIFF to display outside its intended bounds when reprojection is involved.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem stems from a misleading parameter name: `wrapX` in the GeoTIFF source is actually used to crop the output to the tile grid extent on both x and y axes, not just for wrapping around the world on the x-axis as the name suggests. 

When reprojection occurs, this cropping functionality is not being properly applied. The issue is likely in the code that handles reprojection of GeoTIFF data, where the `wrapX` parameter's true purpose (cropping to tile grid extent) is not being respected during the reprojection process.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix the issue:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js
src/ol/reproj.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
```

The primary issue is likely in the `src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js` file, which handles reprojection of data tiles, and the `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js` file where the `wrapX` parameter is defined and used. The `src/ol/reproj.js` file contains core reprojection functionality that might need to be adjusted. The `src/ol/source/TileImage.js` and `src/ol/source/DataTile.js` files are also relevant as they likely contain code related to tile handling and cropping.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is about the `wrapX` option in GeoTIFF source tiles not being respected when the tiles are reprojected. Specifically:

1. The `wrapX` option in GeoTIFF is actually used to crop the output to the tile grid extent on both x and y axes, not just for wrapping around the x-axis.
2. This option works correctly without reprojection, but fails when reprojection is applied.
3. The name `wrapX` is misleading because it's actually controlling cropping behavior, not just x-axis wrapping.
4. With a major release pending, the option should be renamed to something more appropriate.
5. It should be possible to both crop to the original local extent AND repeat in a global projection.

## Files That Need to Be Modified

Based on the repository information and the problem description, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
```

The primary issue is in the GeoTIFF source implementation and how it interacts with the reprojection system. The `GeoTIFF.js` file likely contains the misleading `wrapX` option that needs to be renamed and properly implemented for reprojection scenarios. The `DataTile.js` and `reproj/DataTile.js` files handle the tile data and its reprojection, which is where the cropping behavior needs to be properly respected during reprojection. The base `Tile.js` and `reproj/Tile.js` files may contain underlying functionality that affects how the cropping behavior is (or isn't) propagated during reprojection.
