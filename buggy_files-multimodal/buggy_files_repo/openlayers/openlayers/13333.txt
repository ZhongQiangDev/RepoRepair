I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The GitHub problem description shows images of a WebGLTile layer rendering error where images are displayed outside the original extent. The screenshots show map tiles being rendered incorrectly, with tiles appearing outside their intended boundaries.

This appears to be an issue with how WebGL tile layers handle extent boundaries. When rendering tiles, the layer is incorrectly displaying tiles that should be clipped or not rendered at all because they fall outside the defined extent of the layer.

## Cause of the Issue

The most likely cause is a bug in the WebGLTile layer's rendering logic, specifically in how it:
1. Determines which tiles to render based on the current view
2. Clips or handles tiles at the boundaries of the layer's extent
3. Transforms coordinates between different projections or coordinate systems

The issue is likely in the code that determines which tiles to include in the rendering process and how to handle tiles that partially intersect with the layer's extent.

## Most Related Files

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/extent.js
src/ol/tilegrid.js
```

The `WebGLTile.js` file is most critical as it defines the WebGLTile layer class that's explicitly mentioned in the issue. This would contain the core logic for how the layer handles its extent and rendering.

The `TileImage.js` source file would be responsible for loading and managing the tile images that are being incorrectly rendered.

The `renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` file would contain the WebGL-specific rendering code that determines how tiles are drawn to the screen.

The `extent.js` utility file contains functions for working with extents (bounding boxes), which would be used to determine which tiles should be rendered.

Finally, `tilegrid.js` defines how tiles are organized and accessed, which could affect how tiles are selected for rendering at the boundaries of the layer's extent.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem shows WebGLTile layer rendering error images outside the original extent. From the screenshots, we can see tiles being rendered outside their intended boundaries, creating visual artifacts at the edges of the map.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the images and repository information, this appears to be an issue with how WebGL tile layers handle their extents and boundaries. The problem likely occurs when:

1. Tiles are being rendered outside their defined extent
2. The clipping/boundary checking for WebGL tiles is not properly implemented
3. The tile coordinates or extents are not being properly calculated or respected during rendering

This is most likely happening in the tile source handling code, particularly in how DataTile sources (which WebGLTile extends) manage their extents and coordinate calculations.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
```

The issue is most likely in `DataTile.js` which is the base class for WebGL tile sources and handles the core tile data management. The problem could be in how it calculates or respects tile extents.

`TileImage.js` and `TileTexture.js` are also important as they handle the rendering of tiles and texture management in WebGL context.

`TileGrid.js` defines how tiles are organized and their extents are calculated, which is fundamental to proper tile rendering.

`Tile.js` contains the base functionality for all tile sources and might contain code related to extent handling that needs to be fixed.
