I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves a Region Growing functionality using a GeoTIFF file. The user is experiencing two problems:

1. When increasing the level on the slider, pixels below the level become white, but when decreasing the level, the pixels don't change back.
2. When printing the R value of a pixel, the value is incorrect.

Looking at the code, the user is using a WebGLTileLayer with a custom style to mark pixels below a certain level, and then attempting to use a RasterOperation to modify pixels connected to a clicked point.

The core issue appears to be related to how the WebGLTileLayer style is applied and how the RasterSource is accessing the pixel data. The WebGL rendering is likely happening in a separate context from where the pixel data is being read, causing the mismatch between what's displayed and what's being read.

## Files Most Related to the Issue

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/Raster.js
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/layer/Image.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```

The `WebGLTile.js` file is most critical as it handles the WebGL-based rendering of tile data with custom styles, which is directly related to the issue of pixels not changing back when decreasing the level.

The `Raster.js` file is important because it's responsible for the raster operations that are trying to read and modify pixel data, which explains the incorrect R values being reported.

The `GeoTIFF.js` file is relevant as it handles the loading and processing of the GeoTIFF data that's being visualized.

The `Image.js` layer file is included because it's related to how the raster data is being displayed and accessed.

Finally, the `renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js` file is important as it's likely involved in the actual WebGL rendering process that's causing the discrepancy between what's displayed and what's being read.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves a Region Growing tool using a GeoTIFF file where:
1. When increasing the level on the slider, pixels below the level become white (as expected)
2. When decreasing the level, pixels don't change back (unexpected)
3. The R value of a pixel being printed is incorrect

## Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the code, the issue appears to be in how the WebGLTileLayer style is being applied and how the raster operations are handling the GeoTIFF data. The key problems are:

1. The WebGLTileLayer style is not properly updating when the level decreases
2. The pixel values being read from the GeoTIFF are not being correctly interpreted
3. The raster source might not be properly refreshing when the level changes

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/Raster.js
src/ol/render/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
```

The `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js` is most critical as it handles how GeoTIFF data is loaded and interpreted. The issue with incorrect R values is likely related to this file.

`src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js` would be responsible for the WebGLTileLayer style application and updating, which isn't working correctly when decreasing the level.

`src/ol/source/Raster.js` handles the raster operations that are being used to set new RGB values based on the clicked pixel.

`src/ol/render/webgl/TileLayer.js` is involved in the rendering pipeline for WebGL tile layers and could be affecting how style changes are applied.

`src/ol/source/DataTile.js` is the base class for tile data sources like GeoTIFF and might contain relevant code for how pixel data is accessed.
