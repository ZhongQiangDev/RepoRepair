I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with multi-line comments in CMake.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that multi-line comments in CMake (which use the syntax `#[[...]]`) aren't being properly highlighted. Instead, they're being treated like single-line comments that start with `#`.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the problem description and the image provided, it appears that the CMake language definition in Highlight.js doesn't properly recognize the multi-line comment syntax `#[[...]]`. Instead, it's likely only recognizing the standard single-line comment syntax that starts with `#`.

The CMake language supports two types of comments:
1. Single-line comments starting with `#`
2. Multi-line comments enclosed in `#[[` and `]]`

The current implementation seems to only handle the first type, causing the multi-line comments to be incorrectly highlighted.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, the most relevant files would be:

```
src/languages/cmake.js
src/lib/modes.js
```

The `src/languages/cmake.js` file is the primary file that needs to be modified as it contains the language definition for CMake. This file defines how different elements of CMake code should be highlighted, including comments.

The `src/lib/modes.js` file is also relevant as it contains utility functions for defining common highlighting modes, including comment modes, which might be used by the CMake language definition.

The issue requires adding support for the `#[[...]]` multi-line comment syntax in the CMake language definition, which is primarily defined in `src/languages/cmake.js`.
