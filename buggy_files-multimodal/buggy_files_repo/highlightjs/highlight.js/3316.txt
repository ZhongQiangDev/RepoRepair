I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in hljs 11.0.0, primitive types in C++ (like `int`, `char`, etc.) were moved from being highlighted as keywords to being highlighted separately. This change makes the highlighting look unnatural and confusing compared to the previous version, as shown in the before/after screenshots.

## Analyzing the Cause
The cause is a change made in commit 1be7a28 as part of PR #3178, which split primitive types and keywords to be highlighted separately. The user argues that:
1. According to the C++ standard, primitive types are technically keywords
2. Many popular IDEs and text editors (VS Code, CLion, XCode, Notepad++) highlight primitive types as keywords
3. The new highlighting looks unnatural and confusing

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information and the problem description, these are the most relevant files:

```
src/languages/cpp.js
src/languages/c.js
src/languages/c-like.js
src/languages/arduino.js
src/languages/typescript.js
```

The most important file is `src/languages/cpp.js` since it directly defines the C++ language highlighting. The issue specifically mentions that primitive types were moved from `RESERVED_KEYWORDS` to `RESERVED_TYPES`. 

The `c.js` file is also important as C++ inherits from C. The `c-like.js` file likely contains the base definitions that both C and C++ extend. The Arduino file is mentioned in the proposed changes as needing modification since Arduino is a superset of C++. TypeScript is included as it might have similar patterns for handling types vs keywords.
