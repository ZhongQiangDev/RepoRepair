I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is with the handling of trailing escaped backslashes in properties files. When a line ends with an escaped backslash (`\\`), the syntax highlighter is not correctly handling it. In properties files, a single backslash at the end of a line (`\`) is used to escape the newline for multi-line values, but when the last character is an escaped backslash (`\\`), which might be part of a Windows path, the highlighting breaks.

## Analyzing the Cause
The problem occurs because the syntax highlighter for properties files is not correctly distinguishing between:
1. A single backslash at the end of a line (`\`) which escapes the newline
2. A double backslash at the end of a line (`\\`) which represents a literal backslash character

The highlighter is likely treating both cases the same way, causing incorrect highlighting for the second case.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, the most relevant files would be:

```
src/languages/properties.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/highlight.js
```

The `properties.js` file is the most important as it contains the specific syntax highlighting rules for properties files where the bug exists. This is where the regex patterns for handling escaped newlines and backslashes would be defined.

The `modes.js` file contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting rules, which might be used by the properties language definition.

The `highlight.js` file is the core of the library and would be involved in processing the highlighting rules defined in the language files.
