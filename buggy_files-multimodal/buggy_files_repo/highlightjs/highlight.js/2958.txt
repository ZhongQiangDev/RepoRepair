I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that XML tags with single-letter namespace prefixes (like `<a:FAIL xmlns:a="..." />`) are not being highlighted correctly since version 10.4.0, while tags with longer namespace prefixes (like `<abc:OK xmlns:abc="..." />` or `<ab:OK xmlns:ab="..." />`) are highlighted properly.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Looking at the problem description and screenshots, it appears that the XML syntax highlighting is failing to recognize single-letter namespace prefixes as valid. This is likely due to a change in the regular expression pattern that matches XML tag names with namespaces. The pattern might be requiring namespace prefixes to be at least two characters long, which would explain why `abc:` and `ab:` work but `a:` doesn't.

This is a regression that appeared in version 10.4.0, suggesting a change was made to the XML language definition around that time.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, the most relevant files would be those related to XML highlighting:

```
src/languages/xml.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/languages/javascript.js
src/languages/html.js
src/languages/jsx.js
```

The primary file is `src/languages/xml.js` as it would contain the core XML language definition and the regex patterns for matching XML tags and namespaces. This is almost certainly where the bug exists.

The `src/lib/modes.js` file might be relevant if it contains helper functions used by the XML language definition.

The JavaScript, HTML, and JSX files are included because they likely inherit from or interact with the XML language definition, and might provide context for how namespace prefixes should be handled.
