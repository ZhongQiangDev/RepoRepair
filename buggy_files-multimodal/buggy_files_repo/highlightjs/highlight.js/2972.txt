I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the Python type hints issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that highlight.js has limited support for Python Type Hints (PEP 484). In the example code:

`python
class Solution:
    mapping = None  # type: Dict[int, Any]

    def averageOfLevels(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[float]:
`

The type hints (`Dict[int, Any]`, `TreeNode`, `List[float]`) are not being properly highlighted, making them less useful and readable.

## Analyzing the Cause

The problem stems from insufficient support for Python type hints in highlight.js. According to the issue description, there was a commit (07e30ad6f725e2a24193c378ede5e1ff7f0b5b88) that added some support, but it's not comprehensive enough to be useful.

Other syntax highlighters like Magic Python handle these type hints properly, highlighting them distinctly from regular code.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, the most relevant files would be those related to Python syntax highlighting:

```
src/languages/python.js
src/languages/python-repl.js
src/languages/c-like.js
src/languages/typescript.js
src/languages/dart.js
```

Python.js is the most important file as it contains the main syntax highlighting rules for Python. Python-repl.js is related but less important as it handles REPL interactions. 

The other files (c-like.js, typescript.js, and dart.js) are included because they handle languages with type annotations similar to Python's PEP 484, and their implementation could provide useful patterns for improving Python's type hint support.
