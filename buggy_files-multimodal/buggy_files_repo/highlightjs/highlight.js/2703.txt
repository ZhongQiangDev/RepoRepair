I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issues.

## Problem Analysis

There are two related issues described:

1. **Scala Comment Rendering Issue**: Comments after a class declaration but before the opening curly brace are incorrectly rendered as class titles instead of comments.

2. **JavaScript Comment Highlighting Issue**: Comments inside function parameters are not being highlighted properly.

Both issues appear to be related to how the syntax highlighter processes comments in specific contexts.

## Cause Analysis

The core issue seems to be in how Highlight.js identifies and processes comments in certain code structures:

1. For Scala: When a comment appears after a class name but before the opening brace, the highlighter is incorrectly treating the comment as part of the class title rather than as a comment.

2. For JavaScript: The highlighter isn't properly detecting comments that appear within function parameter lists.

These issues suggest problems with the language-specific syntax definitions and possibly with the core highlighting logic.

## Most Relevant Files

Based on the repository information, these are the most important files that would need to be edited:

```
src/languages/scala.js
src/languages/javascript.js
src/highlight.js
src/lib/modes.js
types/index.d.ts
```

The first two files contain the language-specific syntax definitions that need to be fixed. The `src/highlight.js` file contains the core highlighting logic. The `src/lib/modes.js` file includes utilities for defining syntax highlighting modes including comments. The types file might need updates if the fix requires structural changes to the highlighting system.
