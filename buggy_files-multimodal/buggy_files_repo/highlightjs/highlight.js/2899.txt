I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in Dart code, an empty block comment (`/**/`) breaks further syntax highlighting. As shown in the example:
```dart
/**/main(){print("Hello, World!");}/**/
```

The code after the first empty block comment (`main(){print("Hello, World!");}`) is not properly highlighted. The expected behavior would be for the entire code to be properly highlighted, including the code after the empty block comment.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue appears to be in the Dart language syntax highlighting configuration. The problem is likely that the empty block comment (`/**/`) is not being properly handled by the syntax highlighter. When it encounters an empty block comment, it fails to continue processing the rest of the code for highlighting.

This suggests that the regular expression or logic used to identify and process block comments in Dart is not correctly handling the case where there's no content between the opening `/*` and closing `*/`.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/dart.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/highlight.js
```

The most important file is `src/languages/dart.js` because it contains the Dart language definition and syntax highlighting rules, including how comments are handled. This is where the issue with empty block comments needs to be fixed.

The `src/lib/modes.js` file is also relevant because it contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting modes, including the `COMMENT` function which is likely used to define comment handling in Dart.

Finally, `src/highlight.js` is important as it contains the core highlighting logic that processes the language definitions and applies the highlighting.
