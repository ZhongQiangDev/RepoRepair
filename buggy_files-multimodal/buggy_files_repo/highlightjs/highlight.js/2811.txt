I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that in Python code, when a comment appears on the same line as a decorator, the entire line (including the comment) gets the `hljs-meta` class. However, the comment portion (starting with `#`) should be highlighted with the `hljs-comment` class instead.

Example from the description:
`python
@pytest.mark.asyncio  # note use of pytest-asyncio marker
async def test_async_for():  # but this comment works ðŸ¤”
`

In this example, the comment after the decorator (`# note use of pytest-asyncio marker`) is incorrectly highlighted as meta content rather than as a comment, while the comment on the next line works correctly.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue is likely in the Python language definition for Highlight.js. The decorator pattern is probably defined in a way that captures the entire line as meta content without checking for comments within that line. The language definition needs to be modified to recognize and properly highlight comments that appear on the same line as decorators.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information, the most relevant files would be:

```
src/languages/python.js
src/lib/modes.js
```

The primary file that needs to be edited is `src/languages/python.js` since it contains the language definition for Python, including how decorators and comments are highlighted. This file would need to be modified to ensure that comments on the same line as decorators are properly recognized and highlighted.

The `src/lib/modes.js` file might also be relevant as it contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting rules, which could be used to fix the decorator comment issue in a more general way.
