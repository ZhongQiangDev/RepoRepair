I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with bash language highlighting for heredocs and other special characters.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that the `bash` language highlighter does not properly highlight several important syntax elements:
- Pipe characters (`|`)
- Line continuation markers (`\` at end of line)
- Stream redirections (`>`, `<`)
- Heredocs and herestrings (`<<`, `<<<`)
- Command substitution (`$(...)`)

These elements are fundamental to bash scripting but aren't being visually distinguished in the syntax highlighting.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the repository information, the issue is likely in the bash language definition file. The bash language highlighter needs to be updated to recognize and properly highlight these specific shell syntax elements. The current implementation is missing patterns for these operators and constructs, particularly heredocs which are mentioned in the title.

## Most Related Files

```
src/languages/bash.js
src/languages/shell.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/lib/regex.js
src/highlight.js
```

The `bash.js` file is the primary file that needs to be modified as it contains the language definition for bash syntax highlighting. The issue description mentions that the `shell` language also uses the bash language definition, so `shell.js` is also relevant. The `modes.js` and `regex.js` files provide utility functions for creating syntax highlighting patterns, which would be needed to implement heredoc highlighting. Finally, `highlight.js` is the core library file that processes the language definitions.
