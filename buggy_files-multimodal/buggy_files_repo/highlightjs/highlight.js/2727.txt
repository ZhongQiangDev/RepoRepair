I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that member functions in ES6 classes are not being highlighted properly when using highlight.js with marked in a React application. In the provided example, the `constructor` and `render` functions within the `Detail` class are not highlighted as functions, while other syntax elements appear to be highlighted correctly.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is likely in how highlight.js processes and identifies JavaScript class methods. In ES6 classes, methods are defined without the `function` keyword, which might be causing highlight.js to not recognize them as functions for syntax highlighting purposes.

The problem is specifically with JavaScript language definition in highlight.js, which needs to properly identify and highlight class methods in ES6 syntax.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/javascript.js
src/highlight.js
src/languages/typescript.js
```

The most important file is `src/languages/javascript.js` because it contains the language definition for JavaScript, which would need to be updated to properly recognize and highlight ES6 class methods.

The second most important file is `src/highlight.js`, which is the core module that handles the syntax highlighting logic and integrates with language definitions.

The third file is `src/languages/typescript.js` because it extends JavaScript syntax highlighting and might contain relevant patterns for handling class methods that could be useful for fixing the JavaScript definition.
