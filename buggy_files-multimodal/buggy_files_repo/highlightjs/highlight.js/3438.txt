I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with C++ code not rendering properly.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that some C++ code cannot be rendered properly by the syntax highlighter. The user provided a sample C++ code snippet that includes Eigen library usage, and the expected behavior shows proper syntax highlighting, but it's not working correctly.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the problem description and the code sample:
- The issue appears to be with C++ syntax highlighting specifically
- The sample code includes angle brackets (`<>`) for template usage and includes (e.g., `#include <Eigen/Core>`)
- The user is using the `highlight` function (not `highlightAuto`)
- The code snippet in the description shows the issue is with rendering C++ code that contains template syntax and includes

The most likely cause is that the C++ language definition in highlight.js isn't properly handling certain C++ syntax elements, particularly those involving angle brackets in templates and includes.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/languages/cpp.js
src/languages/c-like.js
src/highlight.js
src/languages/c.js
demo/demo.js
```

The `cpp.js` file is most critical as it defines the C++ language syntax highlighting rules. The `c-like.js` file is likely the base that C++ extends, and `c.js` might contain relevant patterns. The `highlight.js` core file contains the main highlighting logic, and `demo.js` shows how the highlighting is applied in the demo, which could help understand the usage context.
