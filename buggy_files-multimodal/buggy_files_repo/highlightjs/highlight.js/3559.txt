I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in Kotlin syntax highlighting, brackets are highlighted with different colors in class inheritance context. Specifically, when a class inherits from another class (e.g., `class TABLE: Tag {`), the opening and closing brackets have different colors, which is inconsistent and visually confusing.

## Analyzing the Cause
The problem appears to be in the Kotlin language syntax highlighting definition. The issue likely stems from how the language grammar is defined for class inheritance patterns. The highlighting engine is incorrectly treating the opening and closing brackets differently when they appear in the context of class inheritance.

## Most Related Files

```
src/languages/kotlin.js
src/highlight.js
```

The primary file that needs to be edited is `src/languages/kotlin.js`, which contains the syntax highlighting rules specific to Kotlin. This is where the class inheritance patterns and bracket highlighting would be defined.

The secondary file is `src/highlight.js`, which is the core module that handles the highlighting logic. While the issue is most likely in the Kotlin-specific rules, understanding how the core highlighting system works might be necessary to properly fix the issue.
