I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that when using the `Operators.(*)` function in F# code, the syntax highlighter incorrectly interprets this as the start of a multi-line comment. In F#, multi-line comments are enclosed in `(* ... *)`, but in this case, the user is trying to use the multiplication operator from the Operators module with the dot notation `Operators.(*)`.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The F# syntax highlighter is incorrectly treating the sequence `(*)` as the start of a multi-line comment when it appears after `Operators.`. This is happening because the highlighter is likely looking for the pattern `(*` to start a multi-line comment without properly considering the context (that it's being used as a qualified operator).

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, the most relevant file would be the one that defines the F# language syntax highlighting rules:

```
src/languages/fsharp.js
```

This file would contain the rules for F# syntax highlighting, including how comments are detected. The issue is specifically with how the multi-line comment detection interacts with the operator usage pattern.

Claude Code: I've identified the single most important file that needs to be modified to fix this issue. The F# syntax highlighting rules in `src/languages/fsharp.js` are incorrectly interpreting the `Operators.(*)` pattern as the start of a multi-line comment. This file would need to be updated to properly handle this specific case where the `(*)` sequence is used as a qualified operator rather than a comment delimiter.
