I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with Perl regex highlighting.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that Perl's regex highlighting fails when using the `m` operator with arbitrary delimiters. Specifically, in the example `$d !~ m(/$);`, the entire pattern `m(/$)` should not be highlighted as a regex - only `/$` should be highlighted as the regex pattern inside the delimiters.

## Analyzing the Cause
Perl allows regex patterns to use various delimiters beyond the traditional `/` character. The `m` operator can be followed by different delimiter characters like `()`, `{}`, `[]`, `<>`, or any non-alphanumeric, non-whitespace character. The same applies to the `qr` operator for regex quotes.

The current implementation in Highlight.js doesn't properly recognize these alternative delimiters for Perl regex patterns, causing incorrect highlighting when using `m(...)` or `qr(...)` style patterns.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Looking at the repository information, the most relevant file would be the one that defines Perl language syntax highlighting. While it's not explicitly listed in the provided repository information, based on the pattern of other language files (like `src/languages/ruby.js`), I can infer that the Perl language definition would be in a similar location.

```
src/languages/perl.js
```

This is the only file that would need to be modified to fix the issue. The fix would involve updating the regex pattern detection to properly handle the `m` and `qr` operators with arbitrary delimiters.
