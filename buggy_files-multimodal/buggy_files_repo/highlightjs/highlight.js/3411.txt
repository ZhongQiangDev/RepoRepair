I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in TypeScript type parameters with camel-case naming (like "OutT"), only the first component ("Out") is highlighted differently from the second component ("T"). This creates inconsistent syntax highlighting where parts of the same identifier have different colors.

## Analyzing the Cause
This is likely a syntax highlighting issue in the TypeScript language definition for Highlight.js. The problem appears to be in how type parameters are identified and tokenized. The regex pattern used to identify type parameters might not be correctly handling camel-case identifiers, causing only the first part to be highlighted as a type while the second part is treated differently.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/languages/typescript.js
src/languages/javascript.js
types/index.d.ts
```

The `typescript.js` file is the most important since it directly defines the syntax highlighting rules for TypeScript. Since TypeScript extends JavaScript, the `javascript.js` file might also contain relevant base definitions that affect how type parameters are highlighted. The `types/index.d.ts` file contains TypeScript type definitions that might be relevant for understanding how type parameters should be properly handled in the highlighting logic.
