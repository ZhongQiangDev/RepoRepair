I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with Verilog syntax highlighting.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in Verilog syntax highlighting, text following backquotes (`` ` ``) until the end of line is incorrectly treated as `meta` scope. This affects:
1. Comments following `` `define`` directives
2. Defined values that use backquotes (`` `CONSTANT``)

## Analyzing the Cause
In Verilog, backquotes are used for macro definitions (`` `define``) and for referencing defined constants (`` `CONSTANT``). The current implementation incorrectly treats everything after a backquote until the end of line as a `meta` scope, which prevents proper highlighting of comments and code that follows backquoted identifiers.

The issue is likely in the Verilog language definition file, where the pattern for matching backquoted text needs to be modified to only match the specific identifier following the backquote, not everything until the end of line.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/verilog.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/highlight.js
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `src/languages/verilog.js`, which contains the language definition for Verilog. This is where the incorrect pattern for backquoted text is defined.

The `src/lib/modes.js` file might be relevant as it contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting modes, which could be used to fix the pattern.

The `src/highlight.js` file is the core of the library and might be needed to understand how language definitions are processed.
