I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that the `BigInt` type is not being highlighted as a type in the same way that `Number` is in the ECMAScript/JavaScript syntax highlighting. Additionally, `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array` are also missing from the highlighting.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The cause is likely that these newer JavaScript types (introduced in ES2020) are not included in the language definition for ECMAScript/JavaScript in the Highlight.js library. The syntax highlighter needs to be updated to recognize these built-in types.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, the most relevant files would be:

```
src/languages/javascript.js
src/languages/typescript.js
src/languages/c-like.js
```

The `javascript.js` file is the most important since it defines the syntax highlighting for JavaScript/ECMAScript, which is where `BigInt` should be recognized as a type. The `typescript.js` file is also important since TypeScript extends JavaScript and would need the same type recognition. The `c-like.js` file is relevant because it appears to serve as a base for C-like languages, which JavaScript's syntax is partially derived from, and might contain shared type definitions.
