I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with TypeScript generics highlighting.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that in TypeScript syntax highlighting, generic types using the `extends` keyword are breaking subsequent highlighting. From the example code and screenshots, we can see that after a generic type with `extends` appears (like `<Something extends string>` or `<T, A extends keyof T, V>`), the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code is incorrect or missing.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Based on the problem description:
- The issue appeared between versions 10.2.1 and 10.3.0
- The user suspects it might be related to a specific commit that modified the TypeScript language definition
- The issue specifically occurs with generics that use the `extends` keyword
- After such a generic appears, the highlighting for subsequent code is broken

This suggests there's likely an issue with how the TypeScript language definition handles generic type constraints (the `extends` keyword in generics). The regex pattern or token handling for generics might be incorrectly implemented, causing the parser to get confused and fail to properly highlight the rest of the code.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/languages/typescript.js
src/highlight.js
types/index.d.ts
```

The most important file is `src/languages/typescript.js` because:
1. It contains the TypeScript language definition and syntax highlighting rules
2. The issue is specifically with TypeScript generics and the `extends` keyword
3. The user mentioned a commit that modified the TypeScript language definition

The second most important file is `src/highlight.js` because:
1. It's the core of the highlighting engine
2. It handles the parsing and application of language definitions
3. If there's an issue with how generics are processed, this file might need adjustments

The third file is `types/index.d.ts` because:
1. It contains TypeScript type definitions that might be relevant to understanding how generics should be handled
2. It could provide insight into the expected structure of language definitions and how they should handle complex syntax like generics

These files would need to be examined and potentially modified to fix the issue with TypeScript generics highlighting.
