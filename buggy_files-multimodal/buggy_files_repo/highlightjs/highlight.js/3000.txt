I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is that PHP arrow functions (introduced in PHP 7.4) are not being highlighted correctly. Specifically:
- Anonymous arrow functions like `fn($x) => $x + $y` are incorrectly having the `fn` part highlighted as a title/function name
- Comments within arrow functions are also being incorrectly highlighted as titles

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be in the PHP language definition for Highlight.js. The syntax highlighter is incorrectly treating the `fn` keyword in arrow functions (`fn($x) => $x + $y`) as a function title/name rather than recognizing it as part of the anonymous function syntax.

Looking at the screenshots:
1. The `fn` is highlighted as if it were a function name
2. Comments within arrow functions are also incorrectly highlighted as titles

This suggests that the PHP language definition in Highlight.js doesn't properly handle the arrow function syntax introduced in PHP 7.4.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, the most relevant files would be:

```
src/languages/php.js
src/highlight.js
```

The `src/languages/php.js` file is the most important one to modify since it contains the language definition for PHP, including how functions and keywords are highlighted. This is where the arrow function syntax needs to be properly defined.

The `src/highlight.js` file is the core of the library and might need to be considered if there are any fundamental issues with how language definitions are processed, but the primary fix would be in the PHP language definition file.
