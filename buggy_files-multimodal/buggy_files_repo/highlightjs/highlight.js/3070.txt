I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is related to CSS class naming in highlight.js:
- When `language-js` class is used, the system also applies the `javascript` class
- However, when `language-javascript` is used, the system does NOT apply the `javascript` class
- This inconsistency causes issues because some themes require un-prefixed class names (like `javascript` instead of `language-javascript`) to work properly

## Analyzing the Cause
This appears to be an issue with how highlight.js handles language aliases and class name generation. The system is inconsistently applying language classes when aliases are used. Specifically, when a short alias like `js` is used with the `language-` prefix, it's also applying the full language name as a class, but this doesn't happen when the full language name is used with the prefix.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/highlight.js
src/lib/utils.js
src/languages/javascript.js
```

The main issue is likely in `src/highlight.js` which contains the core highlighting logic and DOM integration. This file would handle how classes are applied to elements. The `src/lib/utils.js` file might contain utility functions related to class name generation. Finally, `src/languages/javascript.js` would be relevant since it defines the JavaScript language configuration including its aliases.
