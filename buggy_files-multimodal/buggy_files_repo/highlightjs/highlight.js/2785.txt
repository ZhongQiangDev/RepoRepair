I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the PHP variable highlighting issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that PHP variables (which start with `$`) are not being highlighted in code snippets. The user provided screenshots showing the expected behavior (variables highlighted) versus the actual behavior (variables not highlighted).

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The problem appears to be in the PHP language definition for Highlight.js. PHP variables start with a `$` character followed by a valid identifier. The language definition should include a pattern to match and highlight these variables, but it seems this pattern is either missing, incorrectly defined, or not properly applied.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/languages/php.js
src/languages/php-template.js
```

The primary file is `src/languages/php.js`, which contains the main language definition for PHP syntax highlighting. This file would need to be modified to ensure PHP variables are properly highlighted.

The secondary file is `src/languages/php-template.js`, which handles PHP code embedded within HTML/XML templates. This file might also need adjustments to ensure consistent variable highlighting in template contexts.

Both files likely need to include or fix patterns that match PHP variables (identifiers starting with `$`) and assign them appropriate highlighting classes.
