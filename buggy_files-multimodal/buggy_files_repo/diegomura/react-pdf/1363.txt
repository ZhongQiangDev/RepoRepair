Let me analyze this:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- RGBA color doesn't work correctly in Text component when setting color or backgroundColor
- The example shows that RGBA color works differently between Text and View components, suggesting inconsistent color handling

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how color values (specifically RGBA) are processed and transformed between components
- The color transformation logic likely differs between Text and View components
- The core issue seems to be in how colors are parsed, normalized and applied in the stylesheet and rendering pipeline

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/stylesheet/src/colors.js
packages/render/src/primitives/renderText.js
packages/render/src/primitives/renderBackground.js
packages/textkit/src/layout/applyDefaultStyles.js
packages/stylesheet/src/resolve.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- colors.js handles color transformation and normalization
- renderText.js manages text rendering including color application
- renderBackground.js handles background color rendering
- applyDefaultStyles.js sets default text styling including colors
- resolve.js processes style objects including color properties

The inconsistency likely stems from differences in how colors.js transforms RGBA values and how they're applied differently in text vs background rendering.
