Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When setting borderRadius on a View component with a border, the border rendering becomes distorted and incorrect as the borderRadius value increases
- The border doesn't properly follow the rounded corners of the View
- The issue becomes more severe with larger borderRadius values (e.g. 20, 30)

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with how borders are drawn/rendered around rounded corners in the PDF output
- The problem likely lies in the border rendering logic that needs to properly account for borderRadius when drawing borders
- The border drawing code needs to use proper path drawing with curves to match the rounded corners

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/mixins/borders.js
src/elements/View.js
src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js
src/elements/Base.js
src/renderer.js
```

Reasoning:
- src/mixins/borders.js: Contains the core border drawing logic and is most directly related to the issue
- src/elements/View.js: The View component implementation where the border and borderRadius props are handled
- src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js: Handles style property transformations including border and borderRadius
- src/elements/Base.js: Base component class that View extends from, may contain relevant rendering logic
- src/renderer.js: Core rendering logic that could affect how borders are drawn

The fix would likely need to focus on modifying the border drawing logic in borders.js to properly handle rounded corners.
