Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The margin auto property is not working correctly in v2 of react-pdf
- From the image comparison, we can see that in v1 (left) the elements are centered properly using margin auto, while in v2 (right) they appear aligned to the left

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how margin auto values are processed and applied in the layout system
- Looking at the example code path (knobs/index.js), it involves layout calculations and style processing
- This suggests the problem lies in either:
  - Style resolution/transformation
  - Layout calculation with Yoga (the layout engine used)
  - Margin property handling

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
packages/layout/src/node/getMargin.js
packages/layout/src/steps/resolveStyles.js
packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js
packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- getMargin.js directly handles margin calculations and processing
- resolveStyles.js manages style resolution including margin properties
- expand.js handles style property expansion including margin shorthands
- resolveDimensions.js deals with layout calculations which affect margin positioning
- setYogaValue.js interfaces with the Yoga layout engine for applying style values including margins

The issue likely stems from how margin auto values are being processed and applied through these components of the system.
