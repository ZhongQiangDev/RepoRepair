Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- After wrapping a process with a pool and moving into a sub-process, attempting to drill out (navigate back up) throws an error
- The error indicates "rootElement required" in Canvas.js
- The drilldown overlay appears to not be aware of root element changes

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs during root element changes when drilling down/up in the diagram
- The drilldown breadcrumbs component is failing to properly handle the root element change
- The error suggests the canvas is losing track of the root element during navigation
- This points to an issue in the coordination between drilldown components and root element management

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js
lib/BaseViewer.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js is directly responsible for handling navigation between different levels
- DrilldownCentering.js manages view state during drilldown operations
- DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js handles the overlay UI elements during drilldown
- BaseViewer.js contains core canvas and root element management
- BpmnUpdater.js handles updates to the BPMN diagram structure which could affect root element changes

The primary issue likely lies in DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js where the root element tracking during navigation needs to be fixed.
