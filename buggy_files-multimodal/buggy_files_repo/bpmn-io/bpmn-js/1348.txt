Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Message flows targeting intermediate message catch boundary events are being disallowed in the modeler
- According to BPMN 2.0 spec, message flows should be allowed to target intermediate message catch boundary events
- This is specifically about connection validation rules for message flows

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue likely lies in the connection rules validation logic
- The rules engine is incorrectly preventing message flows from targeting boundary events
- Based on the spec reference, this is a special case where message catch boundary events should be allowed as targets for message flows, while other boundary events should not
- The validation rules need to be updated to allow this specific case

3. Most Related Files:
The key files that would need to be modified to fix this issue are:

```
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/MessageFlowBehavior.js
```

Reasoning:
- BpmnRules.js is the primary file containing connection validation rules and would need to be updated to allow this specific case
- ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js handles connection type replacements and validations
- BpmnFactory.js creates BPMN elements and connections
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js manages property updates when connections are created
- MessageFlowBehavior.js would handle specific message flow behaviors and validations

The fix would primarily involve modifying the connection rules in BpmnRules.js to allow message flows to target intermediate message catch boundary events while maintaining restrictions for other boundary event types.
