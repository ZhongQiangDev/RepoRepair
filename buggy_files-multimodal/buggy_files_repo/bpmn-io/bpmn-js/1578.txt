Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When copying a Pool with a Task inside and pasting it, the resulting XML shows duplicate Process IDs ("Process_17iojvx")
- This causes issues when exporting and importing the diagram since Process IDs must be unique

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the ID management system during copy-paste operations
- When copying a Pool (which contains a Process), the Process ID is not being regenerated to be unique
- The copy-paste functionality is not properly handling the cloning and ID generation for nested Process elements

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
lib/BaseModeler.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/IdClaimHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/UnclaimIdBehavior.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. BpmnCopyPaste.js - Primary file handling BPMN element copying and pasting, including handling of business objects and their properties
2. ModdleCopy.js - Manages property copying between elements in BPMN model, which would include Process IDs
3. BaseModeler.js - Contains core ID management functionality through _collectIds method
4. IdClaimHandler.js - Handles claiming and unclaiming of IDs in the system
5. UnclaimIdBehavior.js - Manages the unclaiming of IDs when elements are deleted, which is relevant for maintaining ID uniqueness

The issue likely needs to be fixed in BpmnCopyPaste.js to ensure Process IDs are regenerated during the copy operation.
