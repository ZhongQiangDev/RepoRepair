Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When reconnecting a connection with more than 2 waypoints to form a loop (connecting start/end points), the connection layout is incorrect
- This issue occurs in both old (<=3) and current bpmn-js versions, though the incorrect layouts differ between versions

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to connection layout handling when creating loops
- The problem specifically occurs with complex connections (>2 waypoints)
- When reconnecting to form a loop, the layout algorithm fails to properly adjust the waypoints
- This suggests an issue in the connection layout behavior and waypoint calculation logic

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling connection layouts and waypoint calculations:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
lib/features/auto-place/AutoPlaceUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LineIntersect.js
```

Reasoning:
- `LayoutConnectionBehavior.js` is the primary file handling connection layouts and waypoint adjustments
- `BpmnLayouter.js` contains core layout logic for BPMN elements and connections
- `AutoPlaceUtil.js` includes utilities for calculating positions and handling connections
- `UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js` manages updates to flow node references which can affect connection layouts
- `LineIntersect.js` provides utilities for calculating line intersections, which is crucial for proper connection routing

The issue likely stems from `LayoutConnectionBehavior.js` not properly handling the special case of reconnecting complex connections to form loops.
