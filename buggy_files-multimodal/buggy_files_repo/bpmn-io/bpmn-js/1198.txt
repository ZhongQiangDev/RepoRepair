Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When adding a Timer Intermediate Catch Event to a non-default sequence flow from an exclusive gateway, the "default" attribute is incorrectly removed from the gateway
- The default flow visual remains rendered despite the attribute being removed
- This issue occurs with other types of catch events as well

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how the default flow attribute is handled during event addition to sequence flows
- The problem likely stems from property management during element updates or modifications
- Since it affects the gateway's "default" attribute specifically, it's likely related to property handling in the modeling behavior or command handlers
- The visual rendering remaining despite attribute removal suggests a disconnect between the model and rendering layers

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the analysis, these files are most likely involved in handling gateway properties and sequence flow modifications:

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js: Directly handles property updates for BPMN elements, including gateway default flows
- BpmnFactory.js: Creates and manages BPMN elements and their properties
- ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js: Handles connection modifications which could affect gateway properties
- Modeling.js: Core modeling functionality that orchestrates element and property updates
- BpmnRules.js: Enforces rules for BPMN elements, including valid connection and property configurations

The issue likely needs to be fixed in UpdatePropertiesHandler.js where the default flow property is being inadvertently removed during event addition.
