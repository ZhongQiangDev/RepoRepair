Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When trying to connect two pools with a message flow after removing a lane from one pool, the connection can only be made by dropping the connector at the pool header
- The connection cannot be made by clicking inside the single lane of the pool, which was previously possible before adding and removing a lane

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with connection behavior and boundary detection after lane modifications
- The problem likely stems from how the system handles pool boundaries and connection points after structural changes (adding/removing lanes)
- The connection rules or boundary detection may not be properly updating after lane removal
- The issue specifically affects message flows between pools, suggesting it's related to inter-pool connection handling

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
lib/features/snapping/BpmnSnappingUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
```

These files were selected because:
- DropOnFlowBehavior.js handles connection behavior when dropping elements
- BpmnRules.js contains the core rules for connections and message flows
- BpmnLayouter.js manages connection layouts and endpoints
- BpmnSnappingUtil.js handles boundary detection and snapping
- UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js manages references after structural changes like lane removal
