Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When attempting to morph a DataStoreReference to a DataObjectReference outside of a Pool, an error is thrown
- The error occurs in BpmnUpdater.js when trying to read properties of undefined in the updateDiParent method
- This suggests the parent reference is missing or invalid when the morphing operation is performed

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error occurs because the code tries to access properties of an undefined parent when updating the DI (Diagram Interchange) parent during the morphing operation
- This happens specifically when the DataStoreReference is outside a Pool, indicating that proper parent handling for elements outside pools is not implemented
- The root cause appears to be in the parent updating logic that doesn't properly handle cases where elements exist outside of pools/participants

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DataStoreBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateSemanticParentHandler.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. BpmnUpdater.js contains the actual error location and handles parent updates
2. DataStoreBehavior.js specifically manages DataStore element behavior and containment
3. UpdateSemanticParentHandler.js handles parent relationship updates
4. BpmnRules.js defines rules for valid operations including element morphing
5. ElementFactory.js creates elements and handles their initial properties
