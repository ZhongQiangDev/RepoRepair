Let me help analyze this issue step by step.

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Message element names are not being rendered in message flows on the BPMN diagram
- From the example image, we can see that while the message flow lines are visible, the names/labels of the message elements themselves are missing

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a rendering issue in the BPMN diagram visualization
- The problem likely lies in either:
  - The label rendering logic for message elements
  - The handling of message element names in the BPMN renderer
  - The label positioning/visibility behavior for message flows

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
```

Reasoning:
- BpmnRenderer.js is the primary file responsible for rendering BPMN elements and their visual components
- LabelBehavior.js handles the lifecycle and positioning of labels for BPMN elements
- LabelUtil.js contains core utilities for label handling and positioning
- LabelEditingProvider.js manages label creation and editing functionality
- BpmnUpdater.js ensures proper updates to the BPMN diagram elements and their properties, including labels

These files would need to be modified to properly handle and render message element names in the diagram.
