Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that pool/lane labels are not rendering correctly when the pool is in vertical orientation. The image shows that the text is not rotated properly to match the vertical orientation of the pool.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the rendering system does not account for the pool's orientation (`isHorizontal="false"`) when positioning and rotating labels. The label orientation should match the pool's orientation, but currently, it remains horizontal even when the pool is vertical.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
```

Reasoning:
- BpmnRenderer.js is the primary file responsible for rendering BPMN elements and their labels
- LabelBehavior.js handles label positioning and behavior
- LabelUtil.js contains utility functions for label management and positioning
- ElementFactory.js creates BPMN elements including their labels
- BpmnImporter.js handles the initial import and setup of BPMN elements including their orientation properties

These files would need to be modified to properly handle label orientation based on the pool's `isHorizontal` property.
