Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When dropping an intermediate event on a sequence flow that has a condition type of expression, and then changing that event into a "Timer Intermediate Catch Event", the expression is incorrectly removed from the sequence flow.

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with property preservation during element replacement
- When replacing one type of intermediate event with a Timer Intermediate Catch Event, the sequence flow's condition expression is being lost
- The problem likely lies in the element replacement behavior or property handling during the replacement operation

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
```

Reasoning:
- ReplaceElementBehaviour.js is most important as it directly handles element replacement behavior and property preservation
- BpmnReplace.js contains core replacement logic and property cloning
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js manages property updates during element modifications
- BpmnUpdater.js ensures proper updates of BPMN elements and their relationships
- BpmnRules.js validates and enforces rules during element modifications

The issue likely stems from incomplete property preservation in ReplaceElementBehaviour.js or BpmnReplace.js when handling the replacement of intermediate events.
