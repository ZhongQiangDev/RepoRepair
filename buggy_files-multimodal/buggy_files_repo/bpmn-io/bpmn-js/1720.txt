Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When transforming a Call Activity into an expanded SubProcess using the wrench menu, the shape does not resize properly
- The resulting shape visually looks like a task (too small for a SubProcess)
- The wrench menu shows confusing additional entries for sub-process collapsed/expanded
- Cannot revert back to call activity after transformation

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue appears to be in the shape replacement and resizing logic when transforming between different BPMN element types. Specifically:
- The shape replacement doesn't properly handle size adjustments when converting to expanded SubProcess
- The menu options aren't properly filtered based on valid transformations
- The bidirectional transformation between Call Activity and SubProcess is broken

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
lib/features/auto-resize/BpmnAutoResize.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

- BpmnReplace.js: Core functionality for replacing BPMN elements and handling their properties during transformation
- ReplaceElementBehaviour.js: Manages behavior of elements when they are transformed into other types
- ReplaceMenuProvider.js: Controls the wrench menu options and handles element replacements
- ElementFactory.js: Responsible for creating elements with proper dimensions based on their type
- BpmnAutoResize.js: Handles automatic resizing of elements when their type changes

The issue likely stems from a combination of improper size handling in the replacement process and incorrect menu option filtering in the replacement UI.
