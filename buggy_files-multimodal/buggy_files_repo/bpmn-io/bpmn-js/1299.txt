Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking on events or gateways, the shapes become smaller than normal or disappear
- When completing direct editing with an empty label, the label target resizes to minimum bounds
- This issue appeared after upgrading from version 6.3.0 to 6.3.3

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to element resizing behavior when:
- Elements are selected (events/gateways)
- Labels are edited and left empty
- The root cause seems to be in commit e4e789b which modified how elements are handled when their labels are empty
- The resizing behavior is incorrectly triggered for both direct element selection and empty label editing

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to the resizing and label editing behavior:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateLabelHandler.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- LabelBehavior.js handles core label behavior and element interactions
- LabelEditingProvider.js manages label editing operations
- UpdateLabelHandler.js processes label updates and their effects on elements
- LabelUtil.js contains utility functions for label handling
- ResizeBehavior.js controls element resizing rules and constraints

The bug likely stems from incorrect handling of empty labels in these files, particularly in how they trigger resizing behavior on the parent elements.
