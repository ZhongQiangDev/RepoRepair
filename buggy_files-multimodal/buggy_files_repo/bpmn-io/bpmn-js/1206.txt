Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that when multiple Boundary Events are selected and moved away from their host shape in a batch operation, they are not being converted to Intermediate Events as expected. This is incorrect because Boundary Events should become Intermediate Events when detached from their host.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be in the event detachment behavior handling. When multiple events are moved simultaneously (batch operation), the conversion from Boundary Events to Intermediate Events is not being triggered properly. This suggests an issue in either:
- The event detachment behavior logic
- The batch movement handling
- The element type conversion during movement

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
```

Reasoning:
- DetachEventBehavior.js is directly responsible for handling the detachment of events and their conversion
- BpmnFactory.js handles the creation of new BPMN elements during conversion
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js manages property updates when elements change
- ReplaceElementBehaviour.js handles element replacement logic which is needed for converting event types
- Modeling.js provides core modeling operations that coordinate these behaviors

The fix would likely need to modify DetachEventBehavior.js to properly handle batch operations when detaching multiple boundary events.
