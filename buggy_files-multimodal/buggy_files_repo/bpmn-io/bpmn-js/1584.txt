Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When adding the first participant/pool to a model, the process ID remains unchanged (Process_1)
- After undoing this action, the process ID still remains unchanged (Process_1)
- However, when redoing the action, the process ID changes unexpectedly
- Additionally, when removing the last participant via delete (not undo), the process ID also changes unexpectedly
- When copying a pool, duplicate process IDs are created, causing validation issues

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue appears to be inconsistent handling of process IDs during:
- Participant creation/deletion operations
- Undo/redo operations for participants
- Copy/paste operations for pools
The root cause seems to be in the ID management system and how it handles process IDs during these operations, particularly in the modeling and command handling components.

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateCanvasRootHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateParticipantBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/RemoveParticipantBehavior.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- BpmnFactory.js handles the creation of BPMN elements and their IDs
- BpmnCopyPaste.js manages the copy/paste operations and should handle ID duplication
- UpdateCanvasRootHandler.js manages updates to the root element (process) which affects its ID
- CreateParticipantBehavior.js handles participant creation and associated process changes
- RemoveParticipantBehavior.js manages participant removal and related process updates

The issue likely requires coordination between these components to maintain consistent ID handling during participant operations.
