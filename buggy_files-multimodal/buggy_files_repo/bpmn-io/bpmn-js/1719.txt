Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When changing a subprocess from expanded to collapsed state, labels inside the subprocess (for start event, task, and end event) remain visible when they should be hidden
- The start event label moves far outside its expected position
- This only occurs when performing the steps manually through clicks, not during import/export

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to label visibility and positioning behavior during subprocess collapse
- The core problem likely lies in the label handling logic during element visibility changes
- Since it works during import/export but fails during manual interaction, it's likely related to the runtime behavior handling rather than the data model
- The label positioning issue with the start event suggests problems with label coordinate calculations during collapse

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateLabelHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
```

These files are selected because:
- ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js directly handles subprocess collapse/expand behavior
- LabelBehavior.js manages label updates and positioning during element changes
- LabelUtil.js contains core utilities for label positioning and visibility
- UpdateLabelHandler.js handles label updates during element modifications
- BpmnLayouter.js manages overall element layout including subprocess arrangements

The issue is most likely centered in the interaction between these components, particularly in how they handle label visibility and positioning during subprocess state changes.
