Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GitHub issue description and GIF, when changing a sub-process from parallel multi-instance to sequential multi-instance, the multi-instance properties (like loop cardinality) are lost. This indicates a problem with property preservation during multi-instance type switching.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to how properties are handled during element replacement/transformation. When switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance types, the system is likely replacing the element but not properly copying over the multi-instance specific properties from the old element to the new one. This would involve the element replacement mechanism and property handling during such replacements.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling the described behavior:

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js
```

Reasoning:
- BpmnFactory.js: Handles creation of BPMN elements and their properties
- BpmnReplace.js: Core functionality for replacing BPMN elements while preserving properties
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js: Manages property updates during element modifications
- ReplaceElementBehaviour.js: Controls behavior during element replacement operations
- UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js: Handles updates to the underlying BPMN model properties

These files together handle the element replacement process and property management, which are central to the reported issue of losing multi-instance properties during type switching.
