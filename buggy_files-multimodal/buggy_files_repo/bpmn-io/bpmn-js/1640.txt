Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When changing a sub-process from parallel multi-instance to sequential multi-instance, the multi-instance properties (like loop cardinality) are lost
- This indicates an issue with property preservation during element type changes

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how properties are handled during element replacement/transformation
- When switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance types, the properties specific to multi-instance behavior are not being properly copied or preserved
- This likely involves the element replacement mechanism and property handling during BPMN element transformations

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- BpmnFactory.js: Handles creation of BPMN elements and their properties
- BpmnReplace.js: Core functionality for replacing BPMN elements while preserving properties
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js: Manages updates to element properties
- ReplaceElementBehaviour.js: Controls behavior during element replacement operations
- UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js: Handles updates to the underlying BPMN model properties

The issue likely stems from incomplete property transfer in BpmnReplace.js or incorrect property handling in the update handlers when switching between multi-instance types.
