Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The deep linking overlay for a subprocess is lost/disappears when using it in combination with the multi-diagram plugin. Specifically, when navigating between multiple processes and subprocesses, the deep linking functionality that should show an overlay for subprocess navigation stops working.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to the interaction between deep linking functionality and subprocess navigation. The deep linking overlay is likely being removed or not properly maintained when switching between different diagrams/processes. This suggests there may be conflicts in how the drilldown/navigation state is managed between the multi-diagram plugin and the core deep linking features.

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in the issue:

```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js
lib/util/DrilldownUtil.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
```

Reasoning:
- DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js is most critical as it directly handles the overlay visibility and behavior for drilldown operations
- DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js manages navigation state and hierarchy display which is key to this functionality
- SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js handles subprocess plane management which interacts with both features
- DrilldownUtil.js provides core utilities used by both systems
- DrilldownCentering.js manages viewport adjustments during navigation which could affect overlay persistence

The issue likely stems from DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js not properly maintaining overlay state when interacting with multiple diagrams, or from conflicting state management between these components.
