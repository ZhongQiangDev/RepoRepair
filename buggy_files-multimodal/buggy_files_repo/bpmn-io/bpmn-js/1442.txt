Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GIF and description, when multiple shapes are copied and pasted onto a sequence flow, the connections between them are created in an unexpected way. The behavior that normally handles dropping shapes onto flows isn't working correctly for multiple shapes.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the drop-on-flow behavior handling, specifically when dealing with multiple shapes at once. The current implementation likely only considers single shape scenarios, causing unexpected connection patterns when multiple shapes are involved. The core functionality would be in the modeling behavior files, particularly those handling drop operations and connection creation.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the behavior shown, here are the most relevant files:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
```

Reasoning:
- `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` is the primary file handling the drop-on-flow behavior and would need modification to properly handle multiple shapes
- `BpmnFactory.js` is responsible for creating new BPMN elements and would be involved in creating the connections
- `Modeling.js` contains core modeling operations and would coordinate the overall paste and connection creation process
- `BpmnCopyPaste.js` handles the copy-paste functionality and would need to work correctly with the drop behavior
- `UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js` manages flow node references which would need updating when new connections are created

The fix would likely primarily involve modifying the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` to properly handle multiple shapes during the drop operation.
