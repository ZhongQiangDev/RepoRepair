Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When extracting participant contents into a process diagram, the labels associated with the elements get lost during the copy-paste operation.
- This happens specifically when copying elements from within a participant and pasting them into a new diagram.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how labels are handled during copy-paste operations.
- Based on the repository information, this likely involves the interaction between:
  - The copy-paste functionality (BpmnCopyPaste)
  - Label handling and behavior (LabelBehavior)
  - Model cloning and property management (ModdleCopy)
  - Element creation and factory methods (ElementFactory)

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files for this issue would be:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. BpmnCopyPaste.js is directly responsible for the copy-paste functionality
2. ModdleCopy.js handles the copying of model properties which would include labels
3. LabelBehavior.js manages how labels are created and maintained
4. ElementFactory.js creates new elements during paste operations
5. UpdatePropertiesHandler.js handles property updates which would be needed for label preservation

The core issue likely lies in BpmnCopyPaste.js not properly handling label preservation during the copy operation, or ModdleCopy.js not correctly copying label properties when cloning elements.
