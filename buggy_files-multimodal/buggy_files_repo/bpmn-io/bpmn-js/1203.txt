Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
When an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, its properties (Async Continuations and Job Configurations) are lost during the paste operation. The properties should be preserved just like they are when pasting normally.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in the copy-paste handling logic specifically when converting an Intermediate Event to a Boundary Event. The property loss likely occurs during the element transformation process, where the properties from the original Intermediate Event are not properly transferred to the new Boundary Event during the paste operation.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- BpmnCopyPaste.js handles the core copy-paste functionality and property preservation
- CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js manages the creation of boundary events
- AttachEventBehavior.js handles the conversion of events to boundary events
- ModdleCopy.js manages how model properties are copied
- BpmnReplace.js handles element replacement/transformation logic

The primary issue likely lies in BpmnCopyPaste.js where the property transfer during paste operations needs to be properly handled for the Intermediate Event to Boundary Event conversion case.
