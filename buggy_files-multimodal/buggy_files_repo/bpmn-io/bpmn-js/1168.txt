Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- After pasting a group of elements with a task in the first position, direct editing is automatically activated for that task
- This behavior only occurs when a task is in the first position of the pasted elements
- The issue persists despite a previous fix attempt that selected all elements after pasting

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to the paste operation's handling of direct editing activation
- The current implementation likely triggers direct editing for the first element if it's a task, without properly considering the context of a multi-element paste operation
- The core issue seems to be in the interaction between copy-paste functionality and label editing behavior

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateLabelHandler.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingPreview.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- BpmnCopyPaste.js is the primary file handling copy-paste operations and would be responsible for the initial paste behavior
- LabelEditingProvider.js manages when and how direct editing is activated for elements
- ReplaceElementBehaviour.js handles element replacement during paste operations which could trigger unwanted editing
- UpdateLabelHandler.js manages label updates which might be incorrectly triggered during paste
- LabelEditingPreview.js controls the visual aspects of label editing and could be involved in the unwanted activation
