Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Boundary event associations can be created and saved in the model
- However, these associations are not rendered when the diagram is reloaded/imported
- This suggests an issue with either the import process or the rendering logic for boundary event associations

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how boundary event associations are handled during import and rendering
- Since the associations can be created but not rendered after import, the problem likely lies in:
  - The BPMN importer not properly processing boundary event associations
  - The renderer not correctly handling associations connected to boundary events
  - The model-to-visual mapping for boundary event connections

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/BoundaryEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
```

Reasoning:
- `BpmnImporter.js` is most critical as it handles the import process and element creation
- `BpmnRenderer.js` is responsible for rendering connections and shapes
- `BpmnFactory.js` creates and manages BPMN elements and their relationships
- `BoundaryEventBehavior.js` handles specific behavior for boundary events
- `CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js` manages the creation and setup of boundary events

The core issue likely lies in how the importer processes associations for boundary events during the import phase, followed by how the renderer handles these connections.
