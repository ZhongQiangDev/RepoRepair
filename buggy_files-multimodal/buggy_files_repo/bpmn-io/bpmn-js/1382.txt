Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The DataObjectReference replace menu appears empty, only containing the collection marker
- It should also include an option to switch between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference

2. Cause Analysis:
- The replace menu options for DataObjectReference are not properly configured to include DataStoreReference as a replacement option
- The menu provider needs to be updated to include bidirectional replacement options between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference
- This is likely controlled by the popup menu/replace menu configuration files

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/popup-menu/util/TypeUtil.js
```

Reasoning:
- ReplaceMenuProvider.js is the main file responsible for configuring replacement options in the popup menu
- BpmnReplace.js handles the actual replacement logic between different BPMN elements
- BpmnUpdater.js ensures proper updates when elements are replaced
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js manages property updates during element replacement
- TypeUtil.js helps determine compatible element types for replacement options

The fix would primarily involve modifying ReplaceMenuProvider.js to add DataStoreReference as a replacement option for DataObjectReference and vice versa.
