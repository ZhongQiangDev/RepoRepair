Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that copying boundary events is currently prevented, even though detaching them is now possible. This inconsistency in functionality limits user workflow when working with boundary events.

2. Cause Analysis:
Looking at the problem description, it mentions this is prevented by the `element.copy` rule in `BpmnRules.js`. The rule is likely checking if an element is a boundary event and preventing its copy operation, which needs to be modified to allow copying while maintaining proper BPMN semantics.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js
lib/util/ModelUtil.js
```

Reasoning:
- `BpmnRules.js` contains the direct cause of the issue in its copy rules
- `BpmnCopyPaste.js` handles the core copy-paste functionality for BPMN elements
- `AttachEventBehavior.js` and `DetachEventBehavior.js` manage boundary event attachment/detachment behavior which is closely related to copying
- `ModelUtil.js` provides utility functions for checking element types and properties, which would be used in implementing the fix
