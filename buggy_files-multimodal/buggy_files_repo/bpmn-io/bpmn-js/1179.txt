Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
From the GIF, when dropping an element onto a sequence flow, the incoming sequence flow is incorrectly docked to the top-left corner of the newly dropped element, rather than maintaining a proper connection layout.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be related to:
- Connection layout behavior when elements are dropped on sequence flows
- Docking point calculation for the new incoming sequence flow
- Auto-placement and layout management of connections after element insertion

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most relevant to fixing the docking and layout issues:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/auto-place/AutoPlaceUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
```

Reasoning:
- `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` is primary since it directly handles the behavior when elements are dropped onto flows
- `LayoutConnectionBehavior.js` manages connection layouts and waypoints after modifications
- `AutoPlaceUtil.js` contains utilities for calculating proper element positions
- `BpmnLayouter.js` handles the overall layout logic for connections
- `UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js` manages flow node references which could affect connection handling

The fix would likely need to focus on modifying the docking point calculation in `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` and ensuring proper layout updates through `LayoutConnectionBehavior.js`.
