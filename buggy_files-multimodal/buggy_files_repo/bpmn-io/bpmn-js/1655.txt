Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When setting the color of external labels using `modeling.setColor`, the external label is set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color
- This creates a UX issue since the fill color is too light for labels
- This only happens when color is applied directly to the label, not when applied to the target shape

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the color setting logic for external labels
- The system is incorrectly applying the fill color property instead of the stroke color property to external labels
- This suggests there's an issue in the modeling/command handling code that deals with setting colors on BPMN elements
- The color setting behavior needs to differentiate between external labels and other elements

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information and the cause analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/SetColorHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
```

These files are selected because:
- `SetColorHandler.js` is directly responsible for handling color setting commands
- `Modeling.js` contains the core modeling operations including color setting
- `BpmnUpdater.js` handles updates to BPMN elements including visual properties
- `LabelUtil.js` contains utilities for handling labels including external ones
- `LabelBehavior.js` manages label-specific behaviors and properties

The fix would likely need to be implemented primarily in `SetColorHandler.js` to properly handle external label coloring.
