Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- A message flow can be connected to a boundary event, which should not be allowed according to BPMN semantics
- The issue specifically occurs when trying to connect a participant to a boundary event

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be a rules/validation issue in the BPMN modeling system
- The system is not properly enforcing the BPMN specification rule that boundary events cannot be targets of message flows
- The validation rules for message flow connections need to be updated to explicitly prevent boundary events as targets
- The issue seems to be in the connection rules and modeling behavior components

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateSemanticParentHandler.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- BpmnRules.js is most important as it contains the core validation rules for BPMN connections and would need to be updated to prevent this invalid connection
- ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js handles connection type validation and replacement, which is relevant for message flow connections
- BpmnFactory.js creates BPMN elements and connections, making it relevant for connection handling
- CreateBehavior.js manages element creation behavior including connections
- UpdateSemanticParentHandler.js handles parent-child relationships which can affect connection validity

The fix would primarily involve updating BpmnRules.js to add explicit validation preventing boundary events from being message flow targets.
