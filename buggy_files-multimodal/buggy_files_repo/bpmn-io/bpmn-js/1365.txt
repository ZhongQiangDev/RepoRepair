Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that data objects in BPMN diagrams cannot display the `isCollection` marker, which according to the BPMN 2.0 specification should be possible. This marker indicates that a data object represents a collection of elements rather than a single item.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be missing functionality to:
- Toggle the `isCollection` property on data objects, inputs and outputs
- Render the visual marker for collections when `isCollection=true`
- Handle the property in the model and diagram interchange (DI)
- Update the UI to allow toggling this property similar to multiple/ad-hoc modifiers on user tasks

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
```

Reasoning:
- BpmnFactory.js: Handles creation of BPMN elements and their properties
- BpmnRenderer.js: Responsible for visual rendering of BPMN elements and their markers
- UpdatePropertiesHandler.js: Manages updates to element properties like isCollection
- ReplaceMenuProvider.js: Would need modification to add isCollection toggle option
- Modeling.js: Core modeling functionality that coordinates property updates

These files would need to be modified to implement the isCollection marker functionality properly.
