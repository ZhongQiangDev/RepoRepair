Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- After creating a new task from an existing one, the sequence flow's waypoints are incorrectly serialized as "[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" in the XML output
- This happens specifically when the connection has a middle segment
- The waypoints property should not be serialized directly on the sequenceFlow element in the XML

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to improper handling of waypoint serialization during XML export
- The waypoints objects are being directly stringified instead of being properly converted to BPMN DI (Diagram Interchange) format
- This suggests an issue in either the XML serialization logic or the way waypoints are stored/handled during element creation and connection layout

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling waypoint serialization and XML export:

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LineAttachmentUtil.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- BpmnFactory.js handles the creation of BPMN elements and their properties
- BpmnImporter.js manages how elements and their properties are imported/exported
- LayoutConnectionBehavior.js specifically handles connection layouts including waypoints
- UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js manages flow node references and connections
- LineAttachmentUtil.js provides utilities for handling connection points and waypoints

The issue likely stems from BpmnFactory.js not properly handling the waypoint objects during element creation or serialization, leading to direct stringification instead of proper BPMN DI conversion.
