Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When clicking on a legend label in a multi-line configuration with legend positioned 'right', the click action is performed on the wrong label (the one above the clicked label)
- This misalignment gets worse with more labels (e.g., clicking 4th label triggers action on 3rd)
- The issue affects both click and hover events

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to legend label positioning and hit detection
- Since it gets worse with more labels and multi-line text, it suggests there's a miscalculation in the vertical positioning or hit box calculation for legend items
- The problem is specifically tied to right-aligned legends with multi-line text, indicating potential issues with text wrapping and hit area calculations

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in the legend positioning and hit detection:

```
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
src/core/core.interaction.js
src/core/core.layouts.js
src/helpers/helpers.dom.ts
src/core/core.layouts.defaults.js
```

Reasoning:
- plugin.legend.js: Primary file handling legend rendering and interactions
- core.interaction.js: Handles event detection and processing
- core.layouts.js: Manages positioning and layout calculations
- helpers.dom.ts: Contains utilities for DOM measurements and hit testing
- core.layouts.defaults.js: Defines default layout behaviors that could affect legend positioning

The issue likely stems from incorrect calculations in plugin.legend.js when determining hit areas for multi-line legend items, particularly when positioned on the right side of the chart.
