Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The y-axis labels in bar charts are overlapping in version 2.9.3, whereas they were properly spaced in version 2.7.3. This indicates a regression in the label positioning/scaling logic.

2. Cause Analysis:
Looking at the provided screenshots and fiddles, the issue appears to be with the y-axis scale calculation and label positioning. The scale is not properly calculating the space needed for labels, causing them to overlap. This is likely related to the scale's tick generation and layout calculation logic.

3. Most Related Files:
The files most directly related to this issue would be those handling scale calculations, tick generation, and layout management, particularly for bar charts. Here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.layouts.js
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
```

These files are chosen because:
- scale.linear.js: Handles linear scale calculations and tick generation
- core.layouts.js: Manages overall chart layout including axis spacing
- controller.bar.js: Controls bar chart specifics which could affect scale calculations
- core.scale.js: Contains base scale functionality that could impact label positioning
- core.defaults.js: Defines default behaviors that might affect scale layout

The issue is most likely originating from changes in how linear scales calculate their space requirements or how the layout manager handles axis label spacing between versions 2.7.3 and 2.9.3.
