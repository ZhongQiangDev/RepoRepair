Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Bar chart bars have empty spaces/borders between them when `categoryPercentage: 1` and `barPercentage: 1` are set
- The spacing between bars is not consistent
- The bars don't achieve 100% width as expected in a histogram-style chart

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how bar widths and spacing are calculated in the bar controller
- The `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` settings are not properly translating to full width bars without gaps
- The core calculation for bar positioning and width in the bar controller needs examination
- The scale handling for categories may also be affecting the spacing

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
src/elements/element.bar.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/helpers/helpers.options.js
src/core/core.layouts.js
```

Reasoning:
- `controller.bar.js` is the primary file handling bar rendering and spacing calculations
- `scale.category.js` handles the drawing and interaction of individual bars
- `core.scale.js` provides core scaling functionality that impacts bar widths
- `helpers.options.js` handles option parsing including bar percentages
- `core.layouts.js` manages overall chart layout which could affect bar spacing

The main fix would likely need to be implemented in `controller.bar.js` where the bar width and spacing calculations are performed.
