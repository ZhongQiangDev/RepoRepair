Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When `includeBounds=false` and `min`/`max` axis limits are defined, a tick is sometimes rendered outside the defined `max` axis limit
- This is particularly noticeable with small axis limits (e.g., min: 2.404e-8, max: 2.4141e-8)
- The issue creates unwanted space next to eye diagrams as shown in the left image

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to tick generation and boundary handling in linear scales
- When `includeBounds=false`, the scale should not generate ticks at the exact boundary values
- However, the current implementation seems to be generating an extra tick beyond the max limit
- This suggests an issue with either the tick generation algorithm or the boundary enforcement logic in the linear scale implementation

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/core/core.scale.autoskip.js
src/core/core.ticks.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `scale.linearbase.js` contains the core tick generation logic and boundary handling for linear scales
- `scale.linear.js` extends the linear base scale and handles value-to-pixel conversions
- `core.scale.js` provides fundamental scale functionality and coordinate transformations
- `core.scale.autoskip.js` manages tick skipping and density
- `core.ticks.js` handles tick formatting and general tick utilities

The fix would likely need to be implemented in `scale.linearbase.js` where the tick generation and boundary handling logic resides.
