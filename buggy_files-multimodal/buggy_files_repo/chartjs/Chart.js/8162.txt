Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The legend and title are being rendered twice in Chart.js v3.0.0-beta.7
- This only happens with PIE charts, not LINE charts
- The initial rendering is correct, but a redraw seems to occur afterwards

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how pie charts handle their rendering lifecycle, particularly with plugins like legends and titles
- The problem occurs during updates/redraws rather than initial rendering
- Since it's specific to pie charts and doesn't affect line charts, the issue likely stems from the pie controller's interaction with the plugin system
- The double rendering suggests either multiple update calls or improper plugin lifecycle management

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/controllers/controller.pie.js
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
src/plugins/plugin.title.js
src/core/core.plugins.js
src/core/core.controller.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `controller.pie.js` is directly responsible for pie chart rendering and lifecycle
- `plugin.legend.js` and `plugin.title.js` handle the components being duplicated
- `core.plugins.js` manages plugin lifecycle and rendering
- `core.controller.js` coordinates overall chart updates and rendering

The issue likely stems from the pie controller triggering multiple update cycles or not properly managing plugin rendering states during updates.
