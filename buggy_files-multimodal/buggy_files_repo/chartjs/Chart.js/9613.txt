Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- After upgrading from Chart.js v2.9.4 to v3.5.1, tooltips don't show when using pointerdown/pointerup events on a touchscreen
- Only point hover is working but tooltip isn't displaying

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from event type normalization in the platform layer
- Original event types (pointerdown/pointerup) are being normalized but the plugin event filters are still using the original types
- This mismatch between normalized and original event types causes the tooltip plugin to not recognize the events properly
- The workaround suggests adding 'mousedown'/'mouseup' to options.plugins.tooltip.events, indicating these are the normalized versions of pointer events

3. Most Related Files:
```
src/platform/platform.dom.js
src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js
src/core/core.interaction.js
src/core/core.plugins.js
src/platform/platform.base.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. platform.dom.js - Contains the event normalization logic that's causing the issue
2. plugin.tooltip.js - Handles tooltip behavior and event filtering
3. core.interaction.js - Manages chart interactions and event handling
4. core.plugins.js - Controls plugin system and event propagation
5. platform.base.js - Provides base platform functionality including event handling infrastructure
