Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When hovering over a pie chart segment with a value of 385 while other segments are 0, the border of the initial circle appears incorrectly
- This only happens when using the hoverOffset option
- The issue is reproducible with any array containing 385 as one value while others are 0, e.g. [0,0,385,0]

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how pie chart segments are rendered during hover states
- The hoverOffset option is meant to "push out" a segment when hovered, but something in the calculation or rendering is causing the original circle border to remain visible
- This specific behavior only occurs with the value 385, suggesting there might be an edge case in the angle/arc calculations for pie segments
- The problem likely lies in the core pie chart drawing logic or arc element handling

3. Most Relevant Files:
```
src/controllers/controller.pie.js
src/controllers/controller.doughnut.js
src/elements/element.arc.ts
src/core/core.interaction.js
src/core/core.animations.js
```

These files are ordered by relevance because:
- controller.pie.js handles pie chart-specific rendering logic
- controller.doughnut.js contains the base implementation that pie charts extend from
- element.arc.ts manages the individual arc segments and their hover states
- core.interaction.js handles hover events and state changes
- core.animations.js manages transitions including hover offset animations

The bug is most likely in the interaction between these components when handling hover states for segments with specific values like 385.
