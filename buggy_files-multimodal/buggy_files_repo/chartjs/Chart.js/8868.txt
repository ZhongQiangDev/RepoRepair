Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The first and last horizontal labels on the chart are getting cut off
- An extra horizontal line is being drawn
- This contrasts with vertical axis labels which properly extend outside the chart area

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with label positioning and clipping for horizontal axis labels
- The problem likely stems from how the scale positions and renders its labels, particularly at the edges
- The core scale rendering logic and positioning calculations need adjustment to allow labels to extend beyond chart boundaries

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):
```
src/core/core.scale.js
src/scales/scale.category.js
src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
src/core/core.layouts.js
src/platform/platform.dom.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `core.scale.js` is the primary file handling scale rendering and positioning logic
- `scale.category.js` manages categorical scales which often appear on horizontal axes
- `scale.linearbase.js` contains base functionality for linear scales and label positioning
- `core.layouts.js` handles overall chart layout including margins and boundaries
- `platform/platform.dom.js` manages DOM-specific rendering and clipping behavior

These files would need to be modified to ensure labels can properly extend beyond chart boundaries and prevent unwanted horizontal lines.
