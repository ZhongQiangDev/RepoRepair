Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined
- Occurs when setting `defaults.layout.paddings` in Chart.js v3.0.0-rc.2
- Specifically happens with scatter charts
- The error appears to be triggered by layout padding configuration

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error suggests accessing a 'value' property on an undefined object
- It occurs when trying to set layout padding defaults
- The issue appears to be related to how layout padding is handled in the core configuration and layout system
- The problem seems to stem from incorrect initialization or access of layout-related properties

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the error and repository analysis, these files are most likely involved:

```
src/core/core.layouts.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
src/core/core.config.js
src/platform/platform.dom.js
src/core/core.controller.js
```

Reasoning:
- `core.layouts.js` is primary since it handles layout configurations and padding
- `core.defaults.js` manages default configurations including layout settings
- `core.config.js` handles configuration initialization and validation
- `platform.dom.js` deals with DOM-specific layout calculations
- `core.controller.js` orchestrates chart initialization and updates

These files form the core chain of configuration and layout handling where the undefined value error is likely occurring.
