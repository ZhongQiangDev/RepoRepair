I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that the prop `showEmailSettings` needs to be renamed to `showNotificationSettings` to reflect that the popover now handles both new post notifications and email notification settings (as referenced in PR #20824).

The problem description also mentions a specific test case: in the following management page, recommended sites under the search box should not have a 'Settings' link, even if the user is following one of them.

## Cause of the Issue

The prop name `showEmailSettings` is outdated and doesn't accurately represent the functionality anymore, as the popover now handles both email notifications and post notifications. This naming inconsistency needs to be fixed across the codebase.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
client/blocks/reader-site-notification-settings/index.jsx
client/blocks/reader-recommended-sites/index.jsx
client/reader/following-manage/index.jsx
client/blocks/reader-email-settings/index.jsx
client/components/reader-popover/index.jsx
```

These files are ordered by importance, with the first file likely containing the main component that needs to be updated, and the subsequent files containing references to the prop that needs to be renamed.
