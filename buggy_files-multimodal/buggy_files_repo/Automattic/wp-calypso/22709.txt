I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The problem involves the Jetpack Onboarding Contact Form step. According to the description:

1. If users have inserted a form and connected successfully, we should display a success screen instead of the contact form tile.
2. If they haven't inserted a contact form, they should see the tile.
3. If they haven't connected, we should lead them to the JPC (Jetpack Connect) flow if they try to reach step 4 again.
4. The actual contact form insertion should happen only after the user has connected.

The issue appears to be with the flow and conditional rendering of the contact form step in Jetpack Onboarding, particularly around when the form is inserted and how the success state is displayed.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/contact-form.jsx
client/components/tinymce/plugins/contact-form/plugin.jsx
client/jetpack-onboarding/main.jsx
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/selectors.js
```

These files are the most relevant to fixing the issue:

1. `client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/contact-form.jsx` - This is the main component for the contact form step in Jetpack Onboarding. It needs to be modified to show a success screen when a form has been inserted and connected successfully.

2. `client/components/tinymce/plugins/contact-form/plugin.jsx` - This file handles the actual insertion of the contact form, which according to the description should only happen after the user has connected.

3. `client/jetpack-onboarding/main.jsx` - This is the main controller for the Jetpack Onboarding flow, which would need to handle redirecting users to the JPC flow if they haven't connected.

4. `client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js` - This file contains actions for managing Jetpack Onboarding state, which would need to be updated to track whether a contact form has been inserted and connected.

5. `client/state/jetpack-onboarding/selectors.js` - This file contains selectors for retrieving Jetpack Onboarding state, which would be used to determine whether to show the success screen or the contact form tile.
