I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The problem involves adding a new "Stats" step to the Jetpack Onboarding (JPO) flow. This step will:
1. Show an introduction screen for the Stats module
2. If the user hasn't connected yet, lead them to the Jetpack Connect (JPC) flow
3. Maintain the JPO navigation (back/skip links) during the JPC flow
4. After connecting (or if already connected), enable the Stats module and show a success screen
5. The success screen CTA should lead to the next step

The key issue is that this functionality doesn't exist yet and needs to be implemented as a completely new step in the onboarding flow.

## Most Relevant Files

Based on the repository information, these are the most important files that would need to be edited:

```
client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/stats.jsx
client/jetpack-onboarding/index.js
client/jetpack-onboarding/constants.js
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/reducer.js
```

The first file (`stats.jsx`) would need to be created as it doesn't exist yet, while the others would need to be modified to incorporate the new step into the flow.

The `stats.jsx` file would contain the React component for the Stats step, including the introduction screen, connection logic, and success screen.

The `index.js` file would need to be updated to include the new step in the routing.

The `constants.js` file would need to be modified to add the new step to the list of valid steps.

The `actions.js` and `reducer.js` files would need updates to handle the enabling of the Stats module and any related state management.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that would need to be edited to implement the new Jetpack Onboarding Stats step.

## 1. Identifying the behavior to implement

The task is to introduce a completely new "Stats" step in Jetpack Onboarding (JPO) that will:
- Show an introduction screen for the Stats module
- Allow users to connect via JPC (Jetpack Connect) flow if not connected
- Enable the Stats module after connecting
- Show a success screen after enabling Stats
- Maintain JPO navigation (back/skip links) during the JPC flow
- Navigate to the next step after completion

## 2. Analyzing what needs to be implemented

This requires:
- Creating new UI components for the Stats step
- Integrating with Jetpack Connect flow
- Adding state management for the Stats module activation
- Updating navigation to maintain JPO controls during JPC flow
- Handling the success state after enabling Stats

## 3. Files most related to the implementation

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files:

```
client/state/ui/oauth2-clients/reducer.js
client/state/users/actions.js
client/state/users/reducer.js
client/state/users/selectors.js
server/api/oauth.js
```

The implementation will primarily involve OAuth and user state management since:
1. `client/state/ui/oauth2-clients/reducer.js` handles OAuth client identification during authentication flows, which will be needed for the JPC connection.
2. `client/state/users/actions.js` and related files manage user data and authentication state, essential for tracking connection status.
3. `client/state/users/reducer.js` will need updates to store the Stats module activation state.
4. `client/state/users/selectors.js` will need selectors to check if Stats is enabled.
5. `server/api/oauth.js` handles OAuth authentication workflows, which will be needed for the JPC connection process.

These files form the core of the authentication and user state management that will be needed to implement the Stats step in Jetpack Onboarding.
