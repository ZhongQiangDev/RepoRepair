I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue described is that when a user selects a featured image from Google Photos library, the image appears to be selected in the editor, but after publishing the post:
1. The featured image doesn't actually display in the preview
2. When trying to close the post, a warning appears about unsaved changes
3. The user needs to add the featured image again for it to actually be applied

This suggests that while the UI shows the image as selected, the actual data isn't being properly saved or applied to the post.

## Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in the integration between the Google Photos library selection and the WordPress featured image functionality. When a user selects an image from Google Photos, the system likely:
1. Shows the image in the UI
2. Fails to properly update the post data with the selected image
3. Doesn't properly mark the changes as saved

## Files That Need Editing

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix the issue:

```
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/preview-container.jsx
client/my-sites/media-library/data-source.jsx
client/blocks/image-editor/image-editor-canvas.jsx
client/state/media/actions.js
```

The primary issue is likely in the `editor-featured-image` components which handle the selection and application of featured images. The `data-source.jsx` file handles the integration with external media sources like Google Photos. The `image-editor-canvas.jsx` may be involved in processing the selected image, and `media/actions.js` would handle the actual saving of the media to the post.
