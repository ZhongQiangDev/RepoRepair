I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue described is that there's an undecoded HTML entity in the "From Name" placeholder in the Store Email Settings page. The screenshot shows "&rsquo;s" appearing in the text instead of being properly decoded to an apostrophe.

This happens when the site title contains an encodable character (like an apostrophe in "Allendav's Store Test") and the From Name field is cleared. The placeholder should show the site title with properly decoded HTML entities, but instead it's showing the raw encoded entity.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem is likely in the code that handles the placeholder text for the From Name field in the email settings. The site title is being retrieved but HTML entities in it are not being properly decoded before being displayed as a placeholder.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/email/reducer.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/email/email-settings/index.js
client/lib/formatting/index.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/email/selectors.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/email/index.js
```

The issue is most likely in the email settings reducer where the site title is processed for the From Name placeholder. The reducer.js file appears to handle decoding HTML entities in the sender's name but there might be an issue with how it's implemented. The email-settings component would be responsible for rendering the field with the placeholder, and the formatting library would contain the functions needed for properly decoding HTML entities. The selectors file would retrieve the data from the state, and the main email index file would coordinate the components.

Claude Code: I've identified the files that would need to be edited to fix the issue with undecoded HTML entities in the From Name placeholder. The primary issue is likely in the email settings reducer where the site title is processed, with the email settings component being responsible for rendering the field with the placeholder.
