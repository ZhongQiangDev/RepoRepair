I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that products cannot be added to a Store if the category contains an ampersand ("&"). Specifically:
- If a product category contains an "&" (e.g., "Hats & Visors")
- When trying to save a product in that category, an error "There was a problem saving" appears
- This happens consistently for subsequent products in that category, or if the category already existed
- Products created via WP-Admin are unaffected, suggesting this is a Calypso (WordPress.com frontend) specific issue

This suggests there's likely an issue with how the ampersand character is being handled in the API request when saving products. The ampersand is a special character in URLs and needs proper encoding. The issue is probably in the code that handles product creation and category association.

## Cause Analysis

Based on the repository information, this appears to be an issue with how product categories containing ampersands are processed when creating or updating products. The problem is likely in the data layer that handles communication with the WooCommerce API, specifically in how category data is prepared or sent.

The most likely cause is improper encoding of the ampersand character when making API requests to create/update products with categories. Since WP-Admin works fine, the issue is specific to the Calypso interface.

## Files That Need Editing

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/data-layer/products/index.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/ui/products/actions.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/data-layer/ui/products/index.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/product-categories/utils.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/http-request.js
```

These files are the most relevant to fixing the issue because:

1. `client/extensions/woocommerce/state/data-layer/products/index.js` - This file handles product API requests, including creating and updating products. It likely needs to properly encode category data when sending to the API.

2. `client/extensions/woocommerce/state/ui/products/actions.js` - Contains action creators for product operations, which may need to properly handle categories with special characters.

3. `client/extensions/woocommerce/state/data-layer/ui/products/index.js` - Manages product action lists and handles category ID mapping, which could be affected by special characters.

4. `client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/product-categories/utils.js` - Contains utilities for product categories, which may need to properly handle ampersands in category names.

5. `client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/http-request.js` - Handles the actual HTTP requests to the WooCommerce API, which may need to ensure proper encoding of special characters.

The core issue is likely in how category data containing ampersands is being processed before being sent to the API, causing validation errors on the server side.
