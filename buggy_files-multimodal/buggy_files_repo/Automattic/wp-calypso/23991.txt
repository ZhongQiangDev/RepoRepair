I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue described is that when a user sets a Featured Image in a new post and then removes it, the post is incorrectly marked as "dirty" (having unsaved changes). This causes the "Are You Sure?" (AYS) dialog to appear when navigating away, even though there are no actual changes to save. Interestingly, this only happens with new posts, not when editing existing posts.

This suggests there's an issue with how the application tracks changes to the featured image, particularly for new posts. The system is not properly resetting the "dirty" state after removing a featured image that was just added.

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause is likely in how the featured image state is managed. When a featured image is added and then removed in the same editing session, the application should consider the post unchanged from its initial state. However, it appears that the removal operation is being tracked as a change that needs to be saved, even though it effectively returns the post to its original state (no featured image).

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx
client/state/posts/actions.js
client/post-editor/post-editor.jsx
client/lib/posts/post-edit-store.js
client/state/ui/editor/actions.js
```

These files are the most relevant to fixing the issue because:

1. `client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx` - This is the primary component handling featured image functionality, including adding and removing images. The issue occurs specifically with featured images, so this file is most likely to contain the code that needs modification.

2. `client/state/posts/actions.js` - Contains actions for post editing, including handling changes to post attributes. The featured image is a post attribute, and this file likely contains the logic for marking posts as "dirty" when attributes change.

3. `client/post-editor/post-editor.jsx` - The main post editor component that manages the overall state of post editing, including tracking changes and handling navigation away from the editor. This file would be involved in determining when to show the AYS dialog.

4. `client/lib/posts/post-edit-store.js` - Manages the state of post editing, including tracking whether a post has unsaved changes. This store would be responsible for determining if a post is "dirty" and needs saving.

5. `client/state/ui/editor/actions.js` - Contains editor-specific actions that might be involved in tracking the state of the editor, including whether there are unsaved changes that would trigger the AYS dialog.

The fix would likely involve modifying how the featured image state is tracked, ensuring that adding and then removing a featured image in the same session doesn't mark the post as dirty.
