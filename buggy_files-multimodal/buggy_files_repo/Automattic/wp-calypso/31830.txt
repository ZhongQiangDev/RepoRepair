I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that app banners are being shown within the mobile apps themselves. When a user is already using the WordPress mobile app and navigates to "My Sites" > select a site > "View My Site" > "Stats", they see an app banner at the bottom promoting the same app they're already using. This creates a confusing user experience.

The root cause is likely that the app banner component is being displayed unconditionally, without checking if the user is already within the mobile app. The app should detect when it's running in its own environment and hide these promotional banners.

## Files That Need Editing

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js
client/lib/mobile/index.js
client/state/ui/selectors.js
client/lib/viewport/index.js
```

The primary file is `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx` which contains the `AppBanner` component that renders the promotional banner. This component needs to be modified to check if it's running within the mobile app before displaying.

The `client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js` file contains utility functions for the app banner, including functions to determine if a banner should be dismissed or shown.

`client/lib/mobile/index.js` likely contains functions to detect if the code is running within the mobile app environment, which would be crucial for this fix.

`client/state/ui/selectors.js` may contain selectors related to the UI state, which could be used or modified to track whether we're in the mobile app.

`client/lib/viewport/index.js` contains utilities for detecting device types and viewport sizes, which might be used in conjunction with the app detection logic.
