I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that monthly Jetpack plans are showing error-like messages about expiring in a month in the Manage Purchases section, causing unnecessary user anxiety. The screenshot shows a notice with a red/error styling that makes it appear as if something is wrong, when in fact this is normal behavior for monthly plans.

The problem might be related to:
1. The styling of the notice (using error styling for non-error situations)
2. The wording of the message making it sound like a problem
3. The notice being shown at all for monthly plans where expiration is expected

The note mentions this might be related to using credits for the purchase, which currently prevents auto-renewal. If that's the case, the message should be more contextual about having a billable payment method on file.

## Files That Need Editing

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/notices.jsx
client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/index.jsx
client/me/purchases/purchase-item/index.jsx
client/lib/purchases/index.js
client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/plan-details/billing-period.jsx
```

These files are responsible for:

1. `client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/notices.jsx` - This file handles the display of notices related to purchases, including expiration notices. It likely contains the logic that determines when and how to show expiration warnings.

2. `client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/index.jsx` - The main component for managing purchases that would include the notices component and control when it's displayed.

3. `client/me/purchases/purchase-item/index.jsx` - Handles the display of individual purchase items in lists, which might include expiration warnings.

4. `client/lib/purchases/index.js` - Contains utility functions related to purchases, including functions that determine expiration status and whether to show warnings.

5. `client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/plan-details/billing-period.jsx` - Handles the display of billing period information, which is directly related to monthly plans and their renewal/expiration messaging.
