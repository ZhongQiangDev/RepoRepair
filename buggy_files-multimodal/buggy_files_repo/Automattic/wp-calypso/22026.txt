I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the spacing issue between the address loading indicator and unit inputs.

## Problem Analysis

1. **Wrong behavior**: The address loading indicator is touching the unit inputs on the shipping page, with no spacing between them.

2. **Cause analysis**: Based on the screenshot and description, this appears to be a CSS styling issue where there's insufficient margin or padding between the address loading indicator and the unit input fields. This is likely happening in a component that renders address forms with loading states.

3. **Related files**: Looking at the repository information, I need to identify files related to address input, shipping, and loading indicators. The most relevant would be components that handle address forms with loading states.

## Files That Need Editing

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/shipping/shipping-origin.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/components/address-view/index.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/components/store-address/index.js
client/my-sites/domains/components/domain-form-fieldsets/eu-address-fieldset.jsx
client/my-sites/domains/components/domain-form-fieldsets/us-address-fieldset.jsx
```

The most important file is likely `client/extensions/woocommerce/components/address-view/index.js` as it appears to be the core component for rendering address forms, which would include both the loading indicator and the unit input fields. The spacing issue would need to be fixed by adding appropriate CSS margin or padding between these elements.
