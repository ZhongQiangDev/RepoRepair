I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that during the Store signup flow, users are not required to verify their email addresses before proceeding. This is problematic because:

1. For countries not supported by Store on wpcom, users need a verified email for their WPCOM session to be valid for authentication against their wp-admin.
2. Currently, there's only a notice prompting users to verify their email, but it doesn't prevent them from proceeding without verification.
3. The proposed solution is to create a new verification step after the Address Page form that would:
   - Allow users from supported countries (US, CA) to proceed to the dashboard setup checklist
   - Require users from non-supported countries to verify their email before proceeding to WC setup in wp-admin

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
client/components/email-verification/email-verification-gate.jsx
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/dashboard/setup-notices.js
client/components/email-verification/index.js
client/lib/user/utils.js
client/components/email-verification/email-unverified-notice.jsx
```

The `email-verification-gate.jsx` is the most critical file as it's responsible for conditionally rendering content based on email verification status. Currently, it's showing a notice but not blocking progress.

The `setup-notices.js` in the WooCommerce extension is likely where the current notice is being displayed without enforcing verification.

The `index.js` file in the email-verification component handles the verification middleware and would need to be modified to enforce verification for specific flows.

The `utils.js` file contains the `needsVerificationForSite` function which determines when verification is required, and would need to be updated to include the Store signup flow.

The `email-unverified-notice.jsx` component displays the current non-blocking notice and would need to be modified or replaced with a blocking verification requirement for non-supported countries.
