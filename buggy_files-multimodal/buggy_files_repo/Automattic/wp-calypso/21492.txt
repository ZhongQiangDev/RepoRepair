I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Problem Analysis

### Wrong Behavior
When a non-admin user (subscriber) attempts to connect their site through Jetpack, after connection they're redirected to `/jetpack/connect/plans`, but instead of seeing the plans page, they see the JPC initial site entry screen. The URL shows `/jetpack/connect/plans` but the content doesn't match.

### Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be in the Jetpack Connect flow. After a successful connection, non-admin users are being redirected to the plans page, but the application is incorrectly rendering the initial site entry screen instead of the plans page. This suggests a problem with:

1. User role/permission checking in the Jetpack Connect flow
2. Conditional rendering logic for the plans page
3. Redirect handling after successful connection

The core issue is likely that the application is not properly handling the case where a non-admin user completes a connection. It's checking for admin status at the wrong point in the flow or not properly passing user role information through the connection process.

## Most Related Files

```
client/jetpack-connect/plans.jsx
client/jetpack-connect/controller.js
client/jetpack-connect/authorize.js
client/jetpack-connect/index.js
client/jetpack-connect/main.jsx
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `client/jetpack-connect/plans.jsx` - This file handles the plans page rendering and logic, which is where the issue is manifesting. It likely contains conditional logic that's incorrectly handling non-admin users.

2. `client/jetpack-connect/controller.js` - This file contains the controller functions for the Jetpack Connect routes, including handling redirects and rendering components based on user state.

3. `client/jetpack-connect/authorize.js` - This handles the authorization flow, which is a key part of the connection process and likely contains logic about what happens after successful connection.

4. `client/jetpack-connect/index.js` - This defines the routes for Jetpack Connect, including the plans route that's showing the wrong content.

5. `client/jetpack-connect/main.jsx` - This is the main component for the Jetpack Connect flow and likely contains logic for the initial site entry screen that's being incorrectly shown.

The issue is likely in how these components interact, particularly in how they determine what to render based on the user's role after a successful connection.
