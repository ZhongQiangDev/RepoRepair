I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when a user:
1. Sets a primary site to a free test site
2. Deletes that site
3. Tries to access the contact form via the help button

The expected behavior is to either show an error message or a site picker since there's no primary site selected.

The actual behavior is that nothing happens, and console errors appear indicating:
```
Cannot read property 'ID' of null
```

This suggests that the code is trying to access the ID property of a site object that is null, which happens when the primary site has been deleted but the code still tries to use it.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
client/blocks/help-contact/index.jsx
client/components/data/query-site-checklist/index.js
client/components/data/query-sites/index.jsx
client/components/sites-dropdown/index.jsx
client/components/site-selector/index.jsx
```

The primary issue is likely in the help-contact component, which is trying to access a property of a null site object. The other files are related to site selection, querying sites, and handling site data, which would be important for implementing a fallback when no primary site exists.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when a user tries to access the contact form through the help button in WordPress.com when they have no primary site selected. The expected behavior is to either show an error message or a site picker, but instead, nothing happens and console errors appear.

The error message indicates that the code is trying to read a property `ID` of `null`, suggesting that the code expects a site object but is receiving `null` instead. This happens when a user deletes their primary site and then tries to access the help/contact form.

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause appears to be that the contact form component is not handling the case where there is no primary site (i.e., `null` site). The code is trying to access `site.ID` without first checking if `site` exists.

## Files That Need to Be Modified

Based on the error message and repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
client/components/help/contact-form/index.jsx
client/me/help/contact/index.jsx
client/me/help/main.jsx
client/state/help/selectors.js
client/state/selectors/get-primary-site-id.js
```

The main issue is likely in the contact form component that's trying to access properties of a null site object. The other files are related to the help section and site selection, which would be involved in properly handling the case when no primary site exists.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the cause.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when a user:
1. Sets a primary site to a free test site
2. Deletes that site
3. Tries to access the contact form via the help button in wordpress.com/me

The expected behavior is to either show an error or a site picker, but instead, nothing happens and console errors appear. The error message indicates:
```
Cannot read property 'ID' of null
```

This suggests that the code is trying to access the `ID` property of an object that is `null`, likely the primary site that was deleted. The help/contact form is trying to use the primary site's ID, but since that site no longer exists, it fails.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information and the error message, these are the most relevant files:

```
client/me/help/help-contact/index.jsx
client/me/help/help-contact-form/index.jsx
client/lib/user/index.js
client/lib/sites-list/actions.js
client/my-sites/current-site/index.jsx
```

The issue is likely in the help contact form components that are trying to access the primary site's ID without properly checking if it exists. The user and sites-list modules are also relevant as they would be responsible for managing the primary site information.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the cause.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when a user tries to access the contact form via the help button in WordPress.com/me when they have no primary site selected. Instead of showing an error message or a site picker, nothing happens, and console errors appear indicating that the code is trying to access properties of a `null` object:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'ID' of null
```

This suggests that the code is expecting a site object to be available, but when a user has deleted their primary site, this object is `null`, and the code doesn't handle this case properly.

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause appears to be that when a user clicks the "contact us" button in the help section, the code attempts to use the primary site's ID to load the contact form. However, when there is no primary site (because it was deleted), the code doesn't have proper fallback logic to either:
1. Show an error message, or
2. Prompt the user to select a site before proceeding

Instead, it tries to access properties of a `null` object, resulting in the JavaScript error.

## Most Related Files

Based on the repository information and the error message, these are the most relevant files:

```
client/me/help/contact/index.jsx
client/me/help/main.jsx
client/state/help/selectors.js
client/state/selectors/get-selected-or-primary-site-id.js
client/state/selectors/get-site.js
```

The issue is most likely in the contact form component that's trying to access a site ID when none exists. The selectors related to getting the primary site or selected site would be involved in this process, and the help main component would be responsible for rendering the appropriate UI when errors occur.
