I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is about a "widow" in text display on the "Priority support" card in the Happiness Support component. A widow is a single word that appears alone on the last line of a paragraph, which is considered poor typography. In this case, the word "account." is appearing on its own line.

According to the note, the developer tried to apply `preventWidows()` to `this.getSupportText()` in `client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx` (line 171), but it didn't work because of the `<strong />` component in the text.

The `preventWidows()` function is designed to prevent widows by replacing the last space in a text string with a non-breaking space, but it doesn't work properly when the text contains HTML elements like `<strong>`.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information and the problem description, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx
client/lib/formatting/index.js
```

The primary file that needs to be modified is `client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx` since it contains the `getSupportText()` method mentioned in the note. The issue is that the current implementation of `preventWidows()` doesn't work with HTML elements like `<strong>`.

The `client/lib/formatting/index.js` file likely contains the `preventWidows()` function implementation, which might need to be enhanced to handle HTML elements properly, or an alternative approach might be needed in the Happiness Support component to apply widow prevention after the HTML has been rendered.
