I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when a user enters a URL with `/wp-admin` appended during the Jetpack Connect process. Instead of recognizing this as a site's admin URL and handling it appropriately, the system:

1. Incorrectly assumes Jetpack needs to be installed (even when it's already installed/activated)
2. Attempts to redirect to a malformed URL with a double `/wp-admin` path (`/wp-admin/wp-admin/plugin-install.php...`)
3. This results in a 404 error on the user's site

The root cause appears to be that the Jetpack Connect flow doesn't properly handle or normalize URLs that include `/wp-admin`. It needs to either strip this path component or handle such URLs differently in the connection flow.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
client/jetpack-connect/main.jsx
client/lib/url/index.js
client/jetpack-connect/controller.js
client/jetpack-connect/utils.js
client/jetpack-connect/index.js
```

The issue is most likely in the Jetpack Connect flow, particularly in how it processes and validates site URLs. The `main.jsx` file is the primary component handling the connection process and URL validation. The URL utility functions in `lib/url/index.js` would be needed to properly normalize the URLs. The controller and utility files handle the routing and connection logic that would need to be updated to properly handle admin URLs.
