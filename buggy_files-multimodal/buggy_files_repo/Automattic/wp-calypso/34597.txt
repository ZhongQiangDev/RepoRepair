I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issues.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem has two main issues:

1. **Issue 1**: Upgrade nudges (like "Ads Earnings" and "Ads Settings") are appearing for non-administrators and users without WordAds access, which shouldn't happen.

2. **Issue 2**: When a user removes all items from the cart, they're incorrectly given access to features they shouldn't have, leading to a broken checkout flow.

## Analyzing the Cause

The root causes appear to be:

1. For Issue 1: The application is not properly checking user permissions before displaying upgrade nudges. Non-administrators are seeing upgrade options they can't actually purchase.

2. For Issue 2: There's a permission check failure after cart items are removed. The application isn't re-validating user permissions after cart changes, allowing unauthorized access to restricted features.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that need to be edited:

```
client/lib/cart/store/cart-synchronizer.js
client/lib/cart/store/index.js
client/my-sites/checkout/cart/cart-item.jsx
client/lib/ads/utils.js
client/lib/upgrades/actions/cart.js
```

These files are most critical because:

1. `client/lib/cart/store/cart-synchronizer.js` - Handles synchronization between the cart and server, which is likely where permissions need to be re-validated after cart changes.

2. `client/lib/cart/store/index.js` - Manages the cart state and updates, which would need to trigger permission checks when items are removed.

3. `client/my-sites/checkout/cart/cart-item.jsx` - Handles individual cart items and their removal, which is directly related to the broken flow when all items are removed.

4. `client/lib/ads/utils.js` - Contains utilities for checking WordAds access permissions, which need to be enforced for non-administrators.

5. `client/lib/upgrades/actions/cart.js` - Manages cart actions like removing items, which should trigger permission validation.
