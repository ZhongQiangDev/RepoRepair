I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that would need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

### Wrong Behavior
Currently, only an Administrator of a site (WordPress.com or Jetpack) can purchase a plan, and once purchased, they are the owner and no one else can control that plan. The problem is that there's no way to transfer ownership of a purchased plan to another Administrator on the same site.

### Cause
The system doesn't have functionality to allow transferring plan ownership between administrators. The proposed solution is to make the Owner box clickable on the Purchases page, which would initiate a flow for transferring ownership to another Administrator on the site.

### Required Changes
We need to implement:
1. A way to make the Owner box clickable
2. A confirmation dialog with warnings about transfer implications
3. A mechanism to display a list of eligible Administrators
4. Backend functionality to transfer plan ownership
5. Email notifications to both the old and new owners
6. Activity log entries for the transfer

## Most Relevant Files

```
client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/purchase-meta.jsx
client/lib/purchases/index.js
client/state/purchases/actions.js
client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/index.jsx
client/lib/purchases/assembler.js
```

These files are the most critical for implementing the plan ownership transfer feature:

1. `client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/purchase-meta.jsx` - This file contains the `PurchaseMeta` component which displays purchase details including the owner information. This is where we need to make the Owner box clickable.

2. `client/lib/purchases/index.js` - Contains utility functions for handling purchases, including ownership-related functions. We'll need to add or modify functions here to support ownership transfers.

3. `client/state/purchases/actions.js` - Contains Redux actions for purchases. We'll need to add new actions to handle the transfer of ownership.

4. `client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/index.jsx` - The main component for managing purchases. We'll need to modify this to support the new ownership transfer flow.

5. `client/lib/purchases/assembler.js` - Handles the creation of purchase objects from API responses. We may need to update this to handle ownership changes in the data structure.
