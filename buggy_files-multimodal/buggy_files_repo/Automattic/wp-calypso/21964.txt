I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

### Wrong Behavior
When a user starts at a WPCC login page, clicks on "Create an account" link, then clicks on "Already have a WordPress.com account? Log in now." link, and finally reloads the login page, the client ID is lost. This causes the styling to be lost, showing the standard WordPress.com login page instead of the branded/styled login page.

### Cause Analysis
The issue occurs because when switching from the signup form back to the login form, the OAuth client ID is not being preserved in the URL. When the user then reloads the page, there's no client ID parameter in the URL, causing the application to render the default WordPress.com login page instead of the styled version that's specific to the OAuth client.

The problem is in the navigation flow between signup and login pages, where the client ID parameter needs to be maintained throughout the journey.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

```
client/signup/index.jsx
client/login/wp-login/login-links.jsx
client/lib/paths/login/index.js
client/signup/wpcom-login-form/index.jsx
client/login/wp-login/index.jsx
```

The most important files are those handling the navigation between signup and login forms, particularly focusing on how URLs are constructed when users click on the "Already have a WordPress.com account? Log in now." link. The `login/wp-login/login-links.jsx` file likely contains the link that needs to be modified to include the client ID, while the `lib/paths/login/index.js` file probably contains the utility function that constructs the login URL. The other files are related to the overall login/signup flow and may need adjustments to properly handle and preserve the client ID parameter.
