I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue involves the Reader feature in Jetpack when trying to load comments for a post where the JSON API is turned off. The problem is:

1. When opening a Jetpack post with the JSON API disabled, the replies endpoint returns a 403 error
2. Instead of handling this gracefully, the system repeatedly retries the request
3. This results in a flood of error notices being displayed to the user
4. A better approach would be to limit retries and show a single error message in the comments section, or set comments to 'off' in the API response

## Cause Analysis

The root cause appears to be inadequate error handling in the comments loading functionality. When the API returns a 403 error, the system doesn't properly detect this as a permanent failure condition and keeps retrying, leading to multiple error notices.

## Most Related Files

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
client/blocks/comments/post-comment-list.jsx
client/blocks/conversation-caterpillar/index.jsx
client/blocks/reader-full-post/index.jsx
client/blocks/comments/helper.jsx
client/blocks/comments/post-comment-with-error.jsx
```

The `post-comment-list.jsx` is likely the main file handling comment loading and would need to be modified to limit retries on 403 errors. The `conversation-caterpillar` component might be involved in expanding comments. The `reader-full-post` file is the main container for the post view where this issue occurs. The `helper.jsx` file likely contains utility functions for comment handling that might need updating. Finally, `post-comment-with-error.jsx` would be responsible for displaying error states in comments, which needs improvement to show a single error message instead of multiple notices.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the cause.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue described is that when opening a Jetpack post for a site that has the JSON API turned off, the replies endpoint returns a 403 error. This causes a "plague of error notices" to appear repeatedly, as shown in the screenshot.

The problem appears to be:
1. The system is trying to load comments for a Jetpack post
2. The JSON API is turned off on the site, causing a 403 error
3. Instead of handling this error gracefully, the system keeps retrying and displaying multiple error notices
4. There's no mechanism to limit retries or display a single error message in the comments section

## Cause Analysis

The root cause seems to be inadequate error handling in the comments loading functionality. When the JSON API is disabled, the system should:
1. Detect the 403 error
2. Limit retry attempts
3. Display a single error message in the comments section
4. Potentially set comments to 'off' in the API response

## Most Related Files

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files:

```
client/jetpack-connect/jetpack-connect-notices.jsx
client/components/data-poller/index.js
client/lib/wp/handlers/http-envelope-normalizer.js
client/lib/wpcom-undocumented/index.js
client/lib/network-connection/index.js
```

The `jetpack-connect-notices.jsx` file is most relevant as it handles displaying notices for Jetpack connections, which would include error notices when trying to load comments from a Jetpack site.

The `data-poller/index.js` file is important because it manages polling operations, which is likely what's causing the repeated error notices as it continues to retry failed requests.

The `http-envelope-normalizer.js` file handles HTTP responses and error normalization, which would be involved in processing the 403 error.

The `wpcom-undocumented/index.js` file likely contains the code that makes the API requests to fetch comments.

The `network-connection/index.js` file handles network connection status and could be involved in the retry logic.
I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue described is that when opening a Jetpack post for a site with the JSON API turned off, the replies endpoint returns a 403 error. This causes a "plague of error notices" to appear repeatedly, as shown in the screenshot. The system is likely retrying the failed request multiple times, causing multiple error notices to stack up.

The problem has three main components:
1. The system is trying to load comments for a Jetpack post where the JSON API is disabled
2. The request fails with a 403 error
3. Instead of handling this gracefully, the system keeps retrying and showing multiple error notices

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause appears to be inadequate error handling for comment loading when the JSON API is disabled. When the system tries to fetch comments and receives a 403 error (permission denied), it should:
1. Limit the number of retries
2. Display a single error message in the comments section
3. Ideally, detect that the JSON API is disabled and set comments to 'off' in the API response

## Most Related Files

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files:

```
client/my-sites/comments/comment-list/index.jsx
client/my-sites/comments/index.js
client/my-sites/comments/controller.js
client/my-sites/comments/comment/index.jsx
client/notices/index.js
```

The `comment-list/index.jsx` file is likely responsible for rendering the list of comments and handling loading states, including error states. The `index.js` and `controller.js` files manage the routing and initialization of the comments section. The `comment/index.jsx` file handles individual comment rendering and might be involved in retry logic. Finally, `notices/index.js` is responsible for displaying error notices, which are being excessively shown in this case.

## Problem Analysis

### Wrong Behavior
When opening a Jetpack post for a site that has the JSON API turned off, the replies endpoint returns a 403 error. This causes a flood of error notices to appear on the screen instead of gracefully handling the error.

### Cause Analysis
The issue occurs because:
1. When the JSON API is turned off on a Jetpack site, the comments endpoint returns a 403 error
2. The system is repeatedly retrying the failed request instead of limiting retries
3. Error notices are being displayed for each failed attempt instead of showing a single error message in the comments section
4. The system doesn't detect that the JSON API is disabled and adjust accordingly

### Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
client/state/data-layer/wpcom/read/sites/posts/replies/new/index.js
client/state/comments/actions.js
client/state/data-layer/wpcom/comments/index.js
client/state/data-layer/wpcom-http/pipeline/retry-on-failure/index.jsx
client/state/comments/reducer.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `client/state/data-layer/wpcom/read/sites/posts/replies/new/index.js` - Handles the API requests for post replies, which is directly related to the failing endpoint
2. `client/state/comments/actions.js` - Contains the action creators for comments, including error handling for failed requests
3. `client/state/data-layer/wpcom/comments/index.js` - Manages the data layer for comments, including error handling and retry logic
4. `client/state/data-layer/wpcom-http/pipeline/retry-on-failure/index.jsx` - Controls the retry behavior for failed HTTP requests
5. `client/state/comments/reducer.js` - Manages the state for comments, including error states

The fix would likely involve modifying these files to:
- Limit the number of retries for comment-related requests
- Improve error handling to display a single error message in the comments section
- Detect when the JSON API is disabled and adjust the UI accordingly
