I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

1. **Wrong Behavior**: After creating a Stripe Connect account, the green success banner (shown in the screenshot) is not being displayed.

2. **Cause Analysis**: Based on the PR review comment, there should be a success banner displayed after successfully connecting a Stripe account. The current implementation is missing this visual feedback to the user. This is likely related to the Stripe Connect integration in the WooCommerce payment settings.

3. **Files Most Related to the Cause**: Looking at the repository information, I need to identify files related to Stripe Connect account creation and success notifications.

The most relevant files would be those handling:
- Stripe Connect account creation/connection
- Success notifications/banners
- Payment method settings UI

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/payments/stripe/payment-method-stripe-complete-oauth-dialog.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/stripe-connect-account/reducer.js
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/stripe-connect-account/actions.js
client/components/banner/index.jsx
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/payments/payment-method-stripe.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:

1. `payment-method-stripe-complete-oauth-dialog.js` is likely responsible for handling the OAuth completion process and should show success feedback
2. `reducer.js` manages the state related to Stripe Connect account, including success states
3. `actions.js` contains the action creators that would dispatch success notifications
4. `banner/index.jsx` is the component that would be used to display the success banner
5. `payment-method-stripe.js` is the parent component that would integrate with the OAuth dialog and success states
