I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The problem is that the workspace is missing a watermark that shows the currently selected sprite or backdrop. This was a feature in Scratch 2.0 that helped users identify which sprite or backdrop they were working with, but it's currently not implemented in the current version.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
The issue requires adding a watermark to the blocks workspace that:
- Shows an image of the currently selected sprite or backdrop
- Has a maximum size of 48px by 48px (3rem by 3rem)
- Is positioned in the top-right corner, aligned with zoom controls
- Has 35% opacity
- Should be positioned below blocks (z-index)
- Needs RTL (right-to-left) language support

This functionality needs to be added to the blocks workspace component, which would need to:
1. Access the currently selected sprite/backdrop
2. Display its image as a watermark
3. Position it correctly with proper styling

## 3. Files most related to the cause

```
src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx
src/containers/blocks.jsx
src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx
src/components/sprite-selector-item/sprite-selector-item.jsx
src/containers/target-pane.jsx
```

These files are the most relevant because:

1. `src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx` - This is the main component that renders the blocks workspace where the watermark needs to be displayed. It would need to be modified to include the watermark element.

2. `src/containers/blocks.jsx` - This container component manages the blocks workspace and connects it to the Redux state. It would need to pass the selected sprite/backdrop information to the blocks component.

3. `src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx` - This container handles sprite selection state and would be a source of information about which sprite is currently selected.

4. `src/components/sprite-selector-item/sprite-selector-item.jsx` - This component renders individual sprite items and contains logic for displaying sprite thumbnails, which would be similar to what's needed for the watermark.

5. `src/containers/target-pane.jsx` - This container manages the overall target (sprite/backdrop) selection state and would be involved in passing the correct information about the selected target.
