I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The GitHub problem description indicates that there's a need to update the `scratch-paint` dependency from version `0.2.0-prerelease.20180621213404` to version `0.2.0-prerelease.20180626185754`. This is a dependency update rather than a bug fix, but the commit message "Redo fill logic (#525)" suggests there were changes to the fill functionality in the scratch-paint library.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
The issue is simply that the project is using an older version of the scratch-paint dependency, and needs to be updated to take advantage of the new features, fixes, or performance improvements in the newer version. Specifically, the commit message indicates changes to the fill logic in PR #525 of the scratch-paint repository.

## 3. Files most related to the cause
Based on the repository information provided, the following files would need to be edited to update the scratch-paint dependency:

```
package.json
package-lock.json
```

The `package.json` file would need to be updated to change the version of the scratch-paint dependency from `0.2.0-prerelease.20180621213404` to `0.2.0-prerelease.20180626185754`. The `package-lock.json` file would also need to be updated to reflect this change.

These are the only files that would need to be directly edited. After updating these files, running `npm install` or `yarn install` would download and install the updated dependency.
