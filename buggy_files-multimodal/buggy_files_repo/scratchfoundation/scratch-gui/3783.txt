I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The GitHub problem description indicates that the dependency `scratch-blocks` needs to be updated from version `0.1.0-prerelease.1542223417` to `0.1.0-prerelease.1542293672`. The description also mentions "Add RTL layout to new extension library," suggesting that the update includes support for right-to-left (RTL) layouts in the extension library component.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
The issue appears to be that the current version of scratch-blocks doesn't properly support RTL layouts for the extension library. The update to the newer version would add this functionality, but the project needs to be configured to properly use and integrate this updated dependency.

## 3. Files most related to the cause

```
webpack.config.js
src/containers/extension-library.jsx
src/components/library-item/library-item.jsx
src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js
src/containers/blocks.jsx
```

These files are the most likely to need modifications because:

1. `webpack.config.js` - This file would need to be updated to reference the new version of scratch-blocks and potentially include any new build configurations needed for RTL support.

2. `src/containers/extension-library.jsx` - This is the container component for the extension library that needs RTL layout support. It would need to be updated to properly handle RTL layouts with the new scratch-blocks version.

3. `src/components/library-item/library-item.jsx` - This component renders individual items in libraries, including the extension library. It would need updates to properly display items in RTL mode.

4. `src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js` - This file generates the XML for the toolbox, which may need adjustments to support RTL layout in the extension blocks.

5. `src/containers/blocks.jsx` - This container manages the blocks workspace and would need to be updated to properly initialize and configure the updated scratch-blocks with RTL support.
