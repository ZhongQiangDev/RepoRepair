I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the colorblind-friendly settings issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that setting switches (like shown/hidden toggle or rotation style settings) currently use color to indicate which option is active:
- Active state: The icon is colored in
- Inactive state: The icon is grayed out

When viewed in grayscale (as a colorblind user might see it), it becomes impossible to distinguish which option is selected because both states appear similar in grayscale.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The current implementation relies solely on coloring the icon differently to indicate selection state. This is insufficient for accessibility purposes. Instead of just changing the icon's color, the solution proposes changing the background color of the selected option, making it visually distinct even in grayscale.

The proposed solution is to:
- Add a colored background to the selected option
- Keep the unselected option with a white (not gray) background
- This creates sufficient contrast even in grayscale view

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to implement the colorblind-friendly setting switches:

```
src/components/direction-picker/direction-picker.jsx
src/components/sprite-info/sprite-info.jsx
src/components/button/button.jsx
src/components/icon-button/icon-button.jsx
src/components/action-menu/action-menu.jsx
```

The `direction-picker.jsx` and `sprite-info.jsx` files are most critical as they likely contain the rotation style settings and shown/hidden switches mentioned in the problem description. The `button.jsx` and `icon-button.jsx` files would contain the base button components that need modification to support background highlighting for selected states. The `action-menu.jsx` file may contain related menu components that use similar selection mechanisms.
