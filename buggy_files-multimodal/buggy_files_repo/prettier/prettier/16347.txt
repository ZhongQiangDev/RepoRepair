I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that empty lines are being removed in markdown YAML frontmatter. Specifically, in the example, the empty lines between items in the `blogs` array are being removed in the output, while they should be preserved.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Looking at the input and output, we can see that:
- The input has empty lines between items in the `blogs` array
- The output has removed these empty lines, making the items directly adjacent
- Other empty lines (like between `docs` and `portfolios` sections) are preserved correctly

This suggests there's an issue with how Prettier handles empty lines specifically within array items in YAML frontmatter. The problem is likely in the markdown parser or the YAML handling code that processes frontmatter in markdown files.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
src/utils/front-matter/print.js
src/language-yaml/printer-yaml.js
src/language-yaml/print/mapping-item.js
src/language-yaml/utils.js
```

The issue is most likely in these files because:

1. `src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js` - This is the main printer for markdown files and would handle how frontmatter is processed within markdown documents.

2. `src/utils/front-matter/print.js` - This file specifically handles printing frontmatter, which is where our issue occurs.

3. `src/language-yaml/printer-yaml.js` - Since the frontmatter is in YAML format, this file would be responsible for how YAML content is printed, including handling of empty lines between array items.

4. `src/language-yaml/print/mapping-item.js` - This file handles printing of mapping items in YAML, which could affect how array items are formatted.

5. `src/language-yaml/utils.js` - Contains utility functions for YAML processing that might be involved in handling whitespace and empty lines.

The issue is likely in how the YAML printer handles empty lines between array items, particularly in the context of frontmatter in markdown files.
