I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that when a file contains only:
1. A directive (like `'use strict';`)
2. Followed by a newline
3. Followed by a comment (like `// comment`)

Prettier adds an extra trailing newline at the end of the file. The file ends with two newlines instead of just one.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue appears to be in how Prettier handles the combination of directives followed by comments, specifically with the babylon parser. The problem is likely in how line breaks are managed when printing these specific node types in sequence.

Based on the old details in the issue, the hardline might be coming from the printer.js file, and there might be an issue with the trim logic in the alignment size handling.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/document/doc-printer.js
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
src/document/doc-builders.js
src/main/core.js
src/common/end-of-line.js
```

The issue is most likely in the document printing logic, specifically how hardlines are handled at the end of files when there's a directive followed by a comment. The `doc-printer.js` file contains the `trimOut` function which handles trailing whitespace, and the `printer-estree.js` file would handle the specific JavaScript AST nodes (directives and comments). The `doc-builders.js` file contains utilities for building document structures, while `core.js` handles the overall formatting process. Finally, `end-of-line.js` manages line ending characters which could be relevant to this issue.
