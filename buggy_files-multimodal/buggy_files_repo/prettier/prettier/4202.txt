I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that when Prettier formats markdown tables, it's creating excessively long lines in the table separator row. Instead of using the simple three-dash pattern (`| :---: | :---: |`), it's creating very long lines that match the width of the content (865 characters in the example). This is particularly problematic for tables containing HTML content like all-contributors tables.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue occurs because Prettier is trying to normalize markdown tables by making the separator row match the width of the content in each column. However, there's no limit on how long these lines can get. When a table contains HTML content (like contributor tables with image tags, links, etc.), these lines become excessively long, making the markdown harder to read and edit.

The fix would involve detecting when table column content is too long and falling back to the simpler three-dash pattern instead of trying to match the content width.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js
src/language-markdown/index.js
src/language-markdown/embed.js
src/doc/doc-printer.js
```

The `printer-markdown.js` file is most important as it would contain the logic for formatting markdown tables, including how the separator rows are generated. This is where we'd need to add a check for column content length and modify the behavior to use simple separators for long content.

The `parser-markdown.js` file is next most important as it handles parsing markdown into an AST, which would include identifying table structures.

The `index.js` and `embed.js` files provide supporting functionality for the markdown language support.

Finally, `doc-printer.js` contains general document printing utilities that might be involved in how table rows are formatted and printed.
