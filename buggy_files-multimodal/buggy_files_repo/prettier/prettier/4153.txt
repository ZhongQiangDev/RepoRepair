I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that Prettier fails to detect the language of a fenced code block in Markdown when there are attributes following the language specification. For example:

````md
```js {cmd=node .line-numbers}
console.log(     "hello world"   );
```
````

Prettier correctly formats code blocks with just a language (`js`), but doesn't format blocks where the language is followed by attributes (`{cmd=node .line-numbers}`).

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is in how Prettier parses and identifies the language in fenced code blocks. Currently, it seems to only recognize the language when it's followed by whitespace or the end of the line. It doesn't properly handle cases where the language is followed by attributes (like `{cmd=node .line-numbers}`).

The parser needs to be modified to extract just the language part (e.g., `js`) from the opening fence line, ignoring any attributes that follow it.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js
src/language-markdown/embed.js
src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
```

The `parser-markdown.js` file is likely the most important as it handles the parsing of Markdown files and would need to be modified to correctly extract the language from fenced code blocks even when attributes are present.

The `embed.js` file is also important as it's responsible for determining which parser to use for embedded code blocks based on the language.

The `printer-markdown.js` file might need adjustments to ensure proper formatting of code blocks with attributes.
