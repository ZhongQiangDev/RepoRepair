I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue involves TypeScript generics formatting where an empty array `[]` is incorrectly formatted with a comma inside it. 

In the example:
```tsx
type aabbccdd<a> = []
type kjhudifkalmcnf<obj extends Record<string, unknown>, aaddffgg extends string[] = aabbccdd<obj>> = aaddffgg extends []? never: never
```

Prettier 2.5.0 incorrectly formats it as:
```tsx
type aabbccdd<a> = [];
type kjhudifkalmcnf<obj extends Record<string, unknown>, aaddffgg extends string[] = aabbccdd<obj>> = aaddffgg extends [
  ,
]
  ? never
  : never;
```

The issue is that an empty array `[]` is being formatted with a comma inside it `[,]`, which is syntactically incorrect in TypeScript.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be related to:
1. The print-width setting (120)
2. The length of the identifier (specifically mentioned in the issue)
3. How Prettier handles empty arrays in TypeScript generics

This is likely a bug in how Prettier formats TypeScript code, specifically when dealing with empty arrays in conditional type expressions. The issue only occurs under specific conditions (print-width: 120 and specific identifier length).

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue are:

```
src/language-js/print/type-annotation.js
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
src/language-js/clean.js
src/language-js/utils.js
src/language-js/needs-parens.js
```

The issue is most likely in the TypeScript/Flow type annotation printing logic, which would be primarily handled in these files. The `type-annotation.js` file would be the most important as it specifically handles printing type annotations, including array types and conditional types in TypeScript. The `printer-estree.js` file contains the main printing logic for JavaScript/TypeScript AST nodes, while the other files provide supporting utilities for cleaning, formatting, and determining parentheses needs.
