I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves inconsistent formatting of comments in `switch` statements. Specifically:
- For `case` statements with inline comments (`case Keyword.impl: // impl<T> Growling<T> for Wolf {}`), the comment remains on the same line
- For `default` statements with inline comments (`default: // expression;`), the comment is moved to the next line

This inconsistency creates a poor user experience as similar constructs are formatted differently.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue appears to be in how Prettier handles comments in `switch` statements, particularly the difference in treatment between `case` and `default` labels. The formatter is likely applying different rules to these similar constructs, causing the inconsistent behavior.

The problem is likely in the JavaScript/TypeScript formatting logic, specifically in how comments are attached to and printed with `case` and `default` statements in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
src/language-js/comments.js
src/language-js/clean.js
src/language-js/needs-parens.js
src/common/util.js
```

The `printer-estree.js` file is most important as it contains the core logic for printing JavaScript/TypeScript AST nodes, including `switch` statements and their `case`/`default` labels. This is where the formatting rules for these constructs would be defined.

The `comments.js` file handles how comments are attached to AST nodes and is crucial for understanding how comments are processed and positioned.

The `clean.js` file preprocesses the AST before printing, which could affect how comments are handled.

The `needs-parens.js` file determines when parentheses are needed, which could indirectly affect formatting.

The `util.js` file contains utility functions that might be used in comment handling and formatting decisions.
