I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves Prettier's formatting of nested code blocks and raw HTML in Markdown files. When using "Format on Save" in VS Code:
- Each time the file is saved, additional indentation is added to nested code blocks and raw HTML
- This causes the indentation to progressively increase with each save
- For code blocks, the issue is intermittent
- For raw HTML, the issue consistently occurs on every save

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue appears to be in how Prettier handles indentation in Markdown files, particularly for nested content like HTML tables within list items. The formatter is incorrectly applying additional indentation on each save instead of maintaining a consistent indentation level.

Based on the example, when an HTML table is nested within a numbered list item, Prettier is adding more spaces to the beginning of each line on every save, pushing the content further right each time.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
src/language-markdown/embed.js
src/language-html/printer-htmlparser2.js
src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js
src/doc/doc-printer.js
```

The issue is most likely in the Markdown printer (`printer-markdown.js`), which handles how Markdown content is formatted, particularly with nested elements. The `embed.js` file handles embedded content like code blocks and HTML within Markdown. The HTML printer (`printer-htmlparser2.js`) would be involved in formatting the HTML table. The Markdown parser and document printer are also relevant as they handle the parsing and final printing of the document structure.
