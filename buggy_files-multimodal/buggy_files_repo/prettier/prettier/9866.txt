I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves unstable JSX formatting with the Unicode character `\u3000` (ideographic space). As shown in the GIF and code examples, Prettier alternates between two different formats when formatting the same JSX code:

1. First format: Keeps the ideographic space (`\u3000`) on the same line as the JSX elements
2. Second format: Adds a line break before the ideographic space

This creates an unstable formatting loop where running Prettier repeatedly keeps switching between these two formats, which is undesirable behavior.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem appears to be related to how Prettier handles whitespace characters in JSX, specifically the ideographic space character (`\u3000`). This character is being treated inconsistently - sometimes as part of the text content that should stay inline, and other times as whitespace that can trigger line breaks.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
src/language-html/utils.js
src/language-html/printer-html.js
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
src/language-js/embed.js
src/common/util.js
```

The issue is primarily related to JSX formatting, which involves both HTML-like syntax handling and JavaScript embedding. The `utils.js` and `printer-html.js` files in the HTML language module would be most critical since they handle whitespace sensitivity and line breaks in HTML-like syntax (including JSX). The JavaScript printer and embed files would be involved since JSX is processed through them. Finally, the common utilities might need adjustments for proper Unicode character handling.
