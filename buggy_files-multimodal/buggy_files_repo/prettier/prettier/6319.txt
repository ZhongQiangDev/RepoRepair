I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the pipeline operator support issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is that Prettier 1.17.1 doesn't support the "Smart" and "F#" proposals for the pipeline operator. When trying to use the Smart pipeline syntax like `5 |> # * 2`, Prettier throws a syntax error: `Unexpected character '#' (1:6)`.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The pipeline operator (`|>`) is an ECMAScript proposal that has multiple variants:
- Minimal proposal: Simple function application (`x |> f`)
- Smart proposal: Uses `#` as a placeholder (`x |> # * 2`)
- F# proposal: Similar to the Smart proposal

Prettier currently only supports the minimal proposal but fails to parse code using the Smart or F# proposals that use the `#` placeholder syntax. This is likely because the Babel parser configuration in Prettier doesn't have the appropriate plugins enabled for these pipeline operator variants.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/language-js/parser-babel.js
src/common/internal-plugins.js
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
src/language-js/clean.js
src/language-js/needs-parens.js
```

The most important file is `src/language-js/parser-babel.js` because it contains the Babel parser configuration that needs to be updated to support the Smart and F# pipeline operator proposals. This file likely needs to be modified to include the appropriate pipeline operator plugin with the correct configuration.

The `src/common/internal-plugins.js` file is also important as it manages the parser plugins that Prettier uses.

The remaining files (`printer-estree.js`, `clean.js`, and `needs-parens.js`) would need updates to properly format and handle the new pipeline syntax, including proper parentheses placement and AST node cleaning.
