I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is about Prettier 2.8.0 adding spaces in Angular Pipes, which was not thoroughly discussed with the Angular community. The problem is:

**Input:**
`html
{{ (user$ | async).credit | currency:'CAD':'symbol-narrow':'4.2-2' }}
{{ (user$ | async).items | slice:1:5 }}
`

**Current Output (with unwanted spaces):**
`html
{{ (user$ | async).credit | currency : 'CAD' : 'symbol-narrow' : '4.2-2' }}
{{ (user$ | async).items | slice : 1 : 5 }}
`

**Expected Output (without spaces):**
`html
{{ (user$ | async).credit | currency:'CAD':'symbol-narrow':'4.2-2' }}
{{ (user$ | async).items | slice:1:5 }}
`

The issue is that Prettier is adding spaces between the pipe name and its arguments, and between the arguments themselves. This contradicts Angular's official documentation style.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem is in how Prettier formats Angular pipe expressions. The code that handles this formatting is adding spaces around the colon (`:`) separators in pipe arguments. This was likely implemented to address issue #13058, but it wasn't properly discussed with the Angular community.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/language-html/embed/angular-interpolation.js
src/language-html/embed/angular-attributes.js
src/language-js/print/angular.js
src/language-html/print/interpolation.js
src/language-js/print/binaryish.js
```

The first two files are directly related to handling Angular templates and interpolations. The `angular-interpolation.js` file is likely responsible for processing the `{{ }}` expressions that contain pipes. The `angular-attributes.js` file handles Angular-specific attributes which may also contain pipes.

The `print/angular.js` file contains the `printAngular` function which processes Angular-specific syntax nodes, including pipe expressions.

The `print/interpolation.js` file (though not explicitly listed in the repository info, it's likely to exist) would handle the interpolation expressions in templates.

Finally, `print/binaryish.js` contains functions related to formatting binary-like expressions, which may include pipe operators since they're similar in structure to binary operators.

The fix would likely involve modifying how spaces are added around pipe arguments, particularly for string and number literals as suggested in the compromise solution.

Claude Code: I notice that I mentioned a file "src/language-html/print/interpolation.js" which wasn't explicitly listed in the repository information. Since I can't be certain this file exists, let me revise my answer with files that are definitely in the repository:

```
src/language-html/embed/angular-interpolation.js
src/language-html/embed/angular-attributes.js
src/language-js/print/angular.js
src/language-js/print/binaryish.js
src/language-js/print/misc.js
```
