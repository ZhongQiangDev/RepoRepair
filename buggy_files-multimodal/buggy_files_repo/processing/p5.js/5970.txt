I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when drawing a textured triangle followed by an untextured square with lighting enabled in WebGL mode. On Android devices, the square doesn't appear.

The root cause is in the shader attribute handling:
1. When drawing a textured triangle, UV information is stored in texture registers in the lightingShader
2. When subsequently drawing the untextured square, the shader still has the texture register enabled
3. The texture data only has 3 vertices (for the triangle), but the square needs 4 vertices
4. While most environments handle this gracefully by filling missing data with zeros, some Android devices treat this as an error and don't render the object

The solution involves disabling unused attribute registers when they're not needed for the current drawing operation.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

```
src/webgl/p5.RenderBuffer.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
src/webgl/p5.Shader.js
```

The primary file that needs modification is `src/webgl/p5.RenderBuffer.js`, which contains the `_prepareBuffer` function that handles buffer preparation for shader attributes. This is where we need to add code to disable registers for unused attributes.

The other files provide context and may need minor adjustments to support the fix, as they handle shader binding, attribute enabling, and WebGL rendering pipeline management.
