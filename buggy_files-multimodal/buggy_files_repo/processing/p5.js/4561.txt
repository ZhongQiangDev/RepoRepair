I'll analyze the problem and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The GitHub problem description highlights two main issues with the `validateParameters` function in the Friendly Error System (FES):
1. **Performance slowdown**: The function runs every time a p5 function is called, causing a performance hit.
2. **Repetitive logging**: The FES floods the console with the same error messages when a function is called repeatedly with invalid parameters.

## Analyzing the Cause
The causes appear to be:
1. `lookupParamDocs` is using a linear search on `data.json` instead of object lookups, which is inefficient.
2. `data.json` contains unnecessary data (1.7MB vs 400KB needed), bloating the library size.
3. Parameter validation is repeated even for identical argument sequences, causing redundant work.
4. There's no caching mechanism to store previous validation results.
5. The console is flooded with identical error messages when the same invalid function call is repeated.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/core/friendly_errors/validate_params.js
src/core/friendly_errors/fes_core.js
docs/preprocessor.js
src/core/friendly_errors/file_errors.js
src/core/friendly_errors/stacktrace.js
```

The first file would contain the `validateParameters` function that needs optimization. The second file would likely contain the core FES functionality. The third file is responsible for processing documentation data which includes the generation of parameter data. The fourth and fifth files are likely related to the error handling and reporting system that needs modification to prevent duplicate error messages.
