I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The GitHub issue describes adding more error messages to FES's (Friendly Error System) `fesErrorMonitor`. The `fesErrorMonitor` catches errors that the browser shows, and the task is to add more errors to the current list of errors in the browser_errors.js file, along with friendly error messages and unit tests.

From the screenshots provided, it appears the task involves adding new browser error patterns to be caught and translated into more user-friendly messages.

## Cause of the Issue

The current implementation of the Friendly Error System doesn't have enough error patterns to catch and provide helpful messages for certain browser errors. The screenshots show examples of errors that need to be added to the system.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/core/friendly_errors/browser_errors.js
src/core/friendly_errors/fes_core.js
src/core/friendly_errors/file_errors.js
src/core/friendly_errors/validate_params.js
test/unit/core/friendly_errors.js
```

The most important file is `browser_errors.js` which contains the list of browser errors that need to be expanded. The `fes_core.js` file likely contains the core functionality of the Friendly Error System, including the `fesErrorMonitor` mentioned in the issue. The `file_errors.js` and `validate_params.js` files are related components of the FES that might need to be referenced or modified. Finally, unit tests will need to be added or updated in the `friendly_errors.js` test file.
