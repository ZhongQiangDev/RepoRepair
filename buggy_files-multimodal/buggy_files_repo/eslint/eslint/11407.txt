Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves the `implicit-arrow-linebreak` autofixer incorrectly adding extra characters when fixing arrow function linebreaks, particularly when comments are present. The autofixer is generating invalid JavaScript code by:
- Adding extra closing parentheses
- Incorrectly handling comments within arrow functions
- Creating syntax errors in the fixed code

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be the autofixer's incorrect handling of:
- Comment placement within arrow functions
- Parentheses balancing when fixing linebreaks
- Edge cases involving comments before arrow function bodies
- Incorrect AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) traversal when applying fixes

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files for this issue:

```
lib/rules/implicit-arrow-linebreak.js
lib/util/source-code-fixer.js
lib/util/fix-tracker.js
lib/util/source-code.js
lib/rules/arrow-body-style.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `implicit-arrow-linebreak.js` is the primary rule file causing the issue
- `source-code-fixer.js` handles the actual application of fixes to the source code
- `fix-tracker.js` manages and validates fix commands
- `source-code.js` provides core functionality for source code manipulation
- `arrow-body-style.js` contains related arrow function formatting logic that may interact with the issue
