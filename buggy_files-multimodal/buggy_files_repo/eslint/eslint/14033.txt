Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When using `--fix` with ESLint, if a variable is declared with `let` and initialized to `undefined`, the auto-fix incorrectly transforms it to `const foo;` instead of `const foo = undefined;`
- This creates a JavaScript syntax error since `const` declarations must be initialized

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue occurs due to incorrect order of rule application during auto-fixing
- The `prefer-const` rule is converting `let` to `const` without considering the `no-undef-init` rule that removes `undefined` initialization
- This creates an invalid state where a `const` declaration has no initializer
- The rules need to be applied in the correct order to prevent this invalid transformation

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/rules/prefer-const.js
lib/rules/no-undef-init.js
lib/rules/utils/fix-tracker.js
lib/source-code/source-code.js
lib/shared/config-validator.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `prefer-const.js` contains the rule that converts `let` to `const`
- `no-undef-init.js` contains the rule that removes `undefined` initialization
- `fix-tracker.js` handles coordination of multiple fixes
- `source-code.js` provides core functionality for source code manipulation
- `config-validator.js` validates rule configurations and their interactions

The fix would likely involve modifying how these rules interact during auto-fixing to ensure proper ordering or preventing invalid transformations.
