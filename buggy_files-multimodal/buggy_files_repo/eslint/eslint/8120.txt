Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `no-unused-vars` rule with `ignoreRestSiblings` flag is not working properly inside function arguments. Specifically, when using rest parameters with object destructuring in function arguments, unused variables are still being flagged as errors even though they should be ignored according to the `ignoreRestSiblings` configuration.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the `no-unused-vars` rule processes rest parameters in function argument destructuring patterns. The `ignoreRestSiblings` flag is likely not being properly applied when analyzing variables within function parameter contexts, even though it works correctly for regular variable declarations.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/rules/no-unused-vars.js
lib/util/source-code-util.js
lib/eslint.js
lib/config/config-validator.js
lib/config/config-file.js
```

The `lib/rules/no-unused-vars.js` is the primary file containing the rule implementation and would need to be modified to properly handle rest siblings in function parameters. The other files support the configuration and validation of the rule options, but the core issue lies in the main rule implementation.
