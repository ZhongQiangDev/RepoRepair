Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves incorrect alignment of object properties when using the `key-spacing` rule with `align: 'value'` in JSX objects. The rule is causing undesired formatting of object properties within JSX style attributes, making the code less readable.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the `key-spacing` rule with `align: 'value'` is being applied too aggressively within JSX contexts. The rule is treating JSX style objects the same way as regular JavaScript objects, leading to awkward alignment that doesn't respect the JSX context's special formatting needs.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lib/rules/key-spacing.js
lib/rules/jsx-quotes.js
lib/rules/indent.js
lib/rules/object-curly-spacing.js
lib/rules/space-before-blocks.js
```

The `key-spacing.js` is the primary file as it contains the core logic for the key spacing rule that's causing the issue. The other files are related to JSX formatting and spacing rules that interact with object literals in JSX contexts.
