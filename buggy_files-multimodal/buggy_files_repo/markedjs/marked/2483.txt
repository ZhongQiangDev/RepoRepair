I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The bug report describes an issue where a fenced code block that follows a list item is not properly recognized as a code block when the code block contains a blank line. The example shows:

```
- abc
```ruby
a

b
```
```

In this case, the code block with a blank line between "a" and "b" is not being properly recognized as a code block when it follows a list item. However, if there's no blank line in the code block, it works correctly.

## Analyzing the Cause

This is likely an issue with how the Markdown parser handles indentation and blank lines within code blocks that follow list items. In CommonMark (as shown by the CommonMark Dingus link in the issue), a code block following a list item should be properly recognized even if it contains blank lines.

The issue is probably in the tokenization or lexing process, where the parser is incorrectly interpreting the blank line as breaking the code block context when it appears after a list item.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Lexer.js
lib/marked.esm.js
lib/marked.umd.js
src/Parser.js
```

The issue is most likely in the tokenization and lexing logic, particularly in how fenced code blocks are handled when they follow list items and contain blank lines. The `Tokenizer.js` and `Lexer.js` files would be the primary places to look for and fix this issue, as they handle the parsing of Markdown syntax into tokens. The compiled files (`marked.esm.js` and `marked.umd.js`) would also need to be updated after fixing the source files. The `Parser.js` file might also be involved if there's an issue with how tokens are processed after lexing.
