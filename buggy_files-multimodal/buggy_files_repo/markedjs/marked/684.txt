I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue involves markdown list rendering behavior. Specifically:
- When a bulleted list is immediately followed by a numbered list (with no blank line), the numbered list continues the numbering from the bulleted list (shown in first screenshot)
- With one blank line between lists, the numbered list still doesn't start at 1 (shown in second screenshot)
- Only with two blank lines between lists does the numbered list render correctly (shown in third screenshot)

The user is questioning why two blank lines are required between different list types, as this doesn't seem to be standard markdown behavior.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

This appears to be an issue with how the markdown parser (marked.js) handles list continuations. The parser is likely treating the numbered list as a continuation of the bulleted list when there isn't sufficient separation between them. 

The core issue is in the list tokenization logic - the parser needs to better distinguish between separate lists versus continuation of the same list. This would involve examining how list items are identified and grouped during the lexing/parsing process.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
lib/marked.js
marked.min.js
```

The issue is most likely in the core parsing logic of the marked.js library. The main implementation file `lib/marked.js` would contain the list parsing logic that needs to be fixed. The minified version `marked.min.js` is just a compressed version of the same code.

The demo file (`docs/demo/demo.js`) is less relevant as it's just using the library rather than implementing the parsing logic itself.
