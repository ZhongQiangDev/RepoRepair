I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with comments not being fully supported.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

From the GitHub issue description, the problem is that comments with `--!>` at the ending are not properly supported in the marked library (version 1.1.1). The screenshots show that GitHub correctly renders HTML comments with this syntax, but the marked library does not.

The issue specifically relates to HTML comments in markdown. Standard HTML comments use `<!-- comment -->` syntax, but it appears that comments ending with `--!>` (instead of the standard `-->`) are not being properly handled by the marked parser.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is likely in the HTML comment parsing logic within the marked library. The parser is probably looking for the standard HTML comment closing pattern `-->` but not recognizing the alternative `--!>` pattern that is valid in some contexts.

This would be in the tokenizer or lexer components that handle HTML and comment parsing. The issue is specifically with how the library identifies and processes HTML comment blocks.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Lexer.js
lib/marked.js
lib/marked.esm.js
src/marked.js
```

The `Tokenizer.js` file is most critical as it likely contains the regex patterns or parsing logic for HTML comments. The issue is probably in the `html` or `tag` methods that handle HTML content.

The `Lexer.js` file is next most important as it uses the tokenizer to process the markdown input and would be involved in how HTML comments are processed.

The other files (`marked.js` and its compiled versions) would need to be updated after fixing the core parsing logic to ensure the fix is propagated throughout the library.
