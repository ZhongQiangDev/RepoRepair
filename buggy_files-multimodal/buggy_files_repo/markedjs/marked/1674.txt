I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the crash when rendering an empty checkbox list item.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is a crash that occurs when rendering an empty checkbox list item in the marked.js library. The error message is:
> `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of undefined`

This suggests that the code is trying to access a property 'type' on an object that is undefined.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
Based on the error and the reproduction steps (rendering `- [ ] ` followed by an empty line), the issue appears to be in the checkbox list item processing. When a checkbox list item is empty (has no content after the checkbox), the code is likely trying to access properties of the non-existent content, resulting in the TypeError.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files to fix the issue:

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Lexer.js
src/Parser.js
src/Renderer.js
lib/marked.js
```

The issue is most likely in the Tokenizer.js file, which handles parsing markdown elements like checkboxes and list items. The Lexer.js file is responsible for breaking down the markdown into tokens, and Parser.js processes these tokens. The Renderer.js file handles the actual HTML output. The lib/marked.js file is the compiled version that includes all these components.

The crash occurs when trying to access a property of an undefined object, which suggests that the tokenization or parsing of empty checkbox list items isn't properly handling the case where there's no content after the checkbox.
