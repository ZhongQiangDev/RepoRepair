I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is about how spaces are handled in the lexer's output when parsing Markdown lists. Specifically:
- When there's a space between a list and a paragraph, the space appears inside the last `list_item` rather than as a separate token at the first level of the semantic tree.
- The expected behavior is that the space node should be at the first level of the tree, between the List and the next Paragraph.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

Looking at the screenshot and description, the issue is in the lexer's tokenization process. When parsing a list followed by a paragraph, the lexer is incorrectly including the space/newline between them as part of the last list item, rather than treating it as a separate token at the root level.

This is likely happening in the list tokenization logic, where the parser needs to determine where a list ends and the next block element begins. The current implementation is too greedy and captures trailing whitespace as part of the list item.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/Lexer.js
src/Tokenizer.js
lib/marked.js
src/marked.js
lib/marked.esm.js
```

The issue is most likely in the `Lexer.js` and `Tokenizer.js` files, which handle the tokenization of Markdown text. The `Lexer.js` file contains the `blockTokens` function that processes block-level tokens, and the `Tokenizer.js` file has the `list` function that specifically handles list parsing. The other files are included because they integrate these components and might need adjustments to properly handle the fixed behavior.
