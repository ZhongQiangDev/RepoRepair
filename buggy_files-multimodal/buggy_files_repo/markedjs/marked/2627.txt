I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The issue is that when there's an escaped square open bracket (`\[`) inside bold text (`**...**`) near the right border of the bold text, and there's a closing brace (`]`) after the bold text ends, the bold formatting is not being recognized properly.

Example: `**strong text\[**\]` should render as "**strong text\[**]" (with "strong text[" in bold), but it's not being rendered correctly.

## Analyzing the Cause

This appears to be an issue with how the Markdown parser handles escaped characters within emphasis/strong formatting. The parser is likely misinterpreting the escaped bracket as part of a link or other structure, causing it to fail to properly close the bold formatting.

The core issue is in the tokenization logic that handles emphasis (bold/strong text) and how it interacts with escaped characters, particularly when those escaped characters are brackets that could be misinterpreted as part of other Markdown syntax.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, the following files are most likely to contain the code that needs to be modified:

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Lexer.js
src/Parser.js
lib/marked.esm.js
lib/marked.umd.js
```

The issue is most likely in the tokenization logic in `src/Tokenizer.js`, which handles parsing the Markdown syntax including emphasis (bold text) and escaped characters. The `src/Lexer.js` file is also important as it coordinates the tokenization process. The `src/Parser.js` file handles converting tokens into HTML output.

The compiled files (`lib/marked.esm.js` and `lib/marked.umd.js`) would also need to be updated after fixing the source files, but the actual fix should be made in the source files.
