I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The bug report shows that users need to escape parentheses with backslashes (`\(`) in Markdown text for them to be properly parsed. Without the backslash, the parser doesn't correctly handle the parentheses. This is not standard Markdown behavior, as parentheses should generally be treated as literal characters unless they're part of a specific syntax (like links).

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue appears to be in the Markdown parsing logic of the marked library. Specifically, it's likely related to how the lexer or parser handles parentheses in regular text. The parser might be incorrectly interpreting unescaped parentheses as part of a syntax pattern (like a link or reference) when they should be treated as literal characters in this context.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, the files most likely needing modification are:

```
lib/marked.js
marked.min.js
```

The issue is most likely in the core parsing logic in `lib/marked.js`, which is the main implementation file. The `marked.min.js` is the minified version that would also need to be updated after fixing the source code.

The demo files (`docs/demo/demo.js` and `docs/demo/worker.js`) are for testing and demonstration purposes and likely don't contain the core parsing logic that needs to be fixed.
