Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Lighthouse incorrectly reports that a minified JS file (amp-date-picker-0.1.js) is not minified
- The tool overestimates potential savings from minification
- This occurs because the file contains a copyright notice with carriage returns and whitespace

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from how Lighthouse analyzes JavaScript files for minification
- The presence of copyright notices with whitespace is causing Lighthouse's minification detection to falsely identify the file as unminified
- The core issue appears to be in how Lighthouse calculates token lengths and estimates potential savings when parsing fails
- The problem specifically relates to the byte efficiency audits for unminified JavaScript

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unminified-javascript.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/simulator.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/scripts.js
lighthouse-core/lib/traces/trace-parser.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- unminified-javascript.js is the primary audit file that handles JavaScript minification detection and savings calculations
- simulator.js handles the simulation of potential savings from optimizations
- network-request.js manages the network requests and response data analysis
- scripts.js gathers JavaScript content for analysis
- trace-parser.js helps process the performance traces and data needed for accurate analysis

These files would need to be modified to better handle cases where JavaScript files contain copyright notices or other necessary whitespace while still being properly minified.
