Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue is that performance metrics (First contentful paint, First meaningful paint, etc.) are not visible in the Timeline view in a user-friendly way. While pwmetrics provides a UI, seeing these metrics against the actual timeline would be more valuable for analysis.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that Lighthouse's performance metrics are not being injected into the trace data in a format that can be visualized in the Timeline view. The metrics need to be converted into trace events and properly injected into the trace data before it's saved, so they can be displayed as markers in the Timeline.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/lib/traces/tracing-processor.js
lighthouse-core/runner.js
lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js
lighthouse-core/lib/traces/devtools-timeline-model.js
lighthouse-core/config/config.js
```

Reasoning:
- tracing-processor.js is most important as it handles trace data processing and analysis
- runner.js orchestrates the entire Lighthouse run including trace collection
- asset-saver.js handles saving trace data and artifacts
- devtools-timeline-model.js manages timeline model integration
- config.js provides configuration for what metrics to collect and how to process them

These files would need to be modified to properly inject performance metrics as trace events that can be visualized in the Timeline view.
