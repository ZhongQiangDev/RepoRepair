Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The problem shows that Google Ads is injecting unwanted user timing marks into the performance measurements, as shown in the screenshot. These irrelevant timing marks could pollute the performance metrics and make it harder to analyze the actual application performance.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue stems from not having proper filtering of user timing marks in the performance measurement system. Third-party scripts (like Google Ads) can inject their own user timing marks, which are then captured alongside the application's legitimate timing marks. There needs to be a mechanism to filter out these unwanted measurements based on certain criteria (like prefix or source).

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js
lighthouse-core/formatters/user-timings.js
lighthouse-core/lib/traces/tracing-processor.js
lighthouse-core/lib/traces/devtools-timeline-model.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-recorder.js
```

Reasoning:
- `user-timings.js` (audit) is the main file handling user timing measurements and contains the filtering logic that needs to be modified
- `user-timings.js` (formatter) handles how these timing measurements are displayed and could help in filtering presentation
- The tracing processor and timeline model files handle the raw performance data collection where the timing marks originate
- The network recorder helps track where these measurements come from, which could be useful for filtering based on source
