Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- NO_FCP (No First Contentful Paint) occurs when the tab is in the background
- Cannot measure performance metrics
- Issue persists regardless of remote server or localhost
- CLI works fine, suggesting it's specific to the extension

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to Chrome's behavior of throttling background tabs
- When running Lighthouse via the extension in a background tab, it cannot properly measure FCP
- This is likely due to Chrome's resource management policies for background tabs
- The CLI works because it runs in a dedicated Chrome instance without background tab throttling

3. Most Related Files:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
lighthouse-core/lib/tracehouse/trace-processor.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/trace-elements.js
lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/lantern-first-contentful-paint.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
1. first-contentful-paint.js (audit) is directly responsible for measuring and reporting FCP metrics
2. first-contentful-paint.js (computed) handles the actual computation of FCP values
3. trace-processor.js processes trace events which are essential for FCP measurement
4. trace-elements.js gathers trace data needed for FCP calculation
5. lantern-first-contentful-paint.js provides simulated FCP estimates when direct measurement fails

These components work together to measure FCP, and their interaction with Chrome's background tab behavior is likely causing the reported issue.
