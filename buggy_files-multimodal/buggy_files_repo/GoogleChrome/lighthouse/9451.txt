Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- During the offline pass, the desktop version of the page loads instead of showing the offline page
- Network requests show `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` flags as `false`, which shouldn't be possible when offline
- The start URL doesn't load offline but the current page does

2. Cause Analysis:
The core issue appears to be that the offline simulation isn't being properly enforced during the audit. Specifically:
- The service worker's offline handling isn't being properly tested
- The network conditions aren't being properly simulated as offline
- There's a discrepancy between how the start URL and current page are handled in offline mode

3. Most Related Files:
The key files involved in offline testing and service worker verification would be:

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/offline.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/service-worker.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `offline.js` - Directly handles offline simulation and verification
2. `service-worker.js` - Gathers service worker information needed for offline functionality
3. `start-url.js` - Specifically tests the start URL in offline mode
4. `emulation.js` - Contains the network emulation logic including offline state
5. `driver.js` - Core driver that coordinates the gathering process and network conditions

These files together control how Lighthouse simulates offline conditions and verifies service worker behavior, which are central to the reported issue.
