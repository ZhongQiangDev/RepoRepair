Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Lighthouse hangs indefinitely at the "Loading page & waiting for onload" step
- This occurs consistently across both native audit and Lighthouse extension v2.8.0
- The issue persists despite previous HSTS-related fixes

2. Cause Analysis:
- The problem appears to be related to page loading and onload event handling
- Since it hangs at waiting for onload, this suggests either:
  - The page's onload event is never firing
  - Lighthouse's timeout or page load detection mechanism is failing
- The issue is likely in the core page loading and evaluation logic rather than specific audit rules

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the analysis, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/html-without-javascript.js
lighthouse-core/index.js
lighthouse-core/runner.js
lighthouse-cli/run.js
lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js
```

These files are chosen because:
- html-without-javascript.js handles core page loading behavior and JavaScript execution states
- index.js contains the main Lighthouse execution logic
- runner.js manages the overall audit process including page loading
- run.js handles the CLI execution and Chrome instance management
- critical-request-chains.js analyzes request chains that might affect page loading

The issue is most likely in the page loading and evaluation logic within these core files, particularly around timeout handling and load event detection.
