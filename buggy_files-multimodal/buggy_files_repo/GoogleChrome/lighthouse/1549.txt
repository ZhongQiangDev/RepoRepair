Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- User timing marks are showing negative numbers in the performance timeline
- This is incorrect since timing marks should show positive durations relative to navigation start

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in how user timing marks are being processed and normalized relative to the navigation start time
- The negative numbers suggest the timestamps are being calculated incorrectly, likely due to improper handling of the reference point (navigation start time) when processing user timing events
- This would be handled in code that processes user timing events and converts them to display values

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):

```
lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js
lighthouse-core/lib/traces/tracing-processor.js
lighthouse-core/formatters/user-timings.js
lighthouse-core/lib/event-helpers.js
lighthouse-core/lib/web-inspector.js
```

Reasoning:
- `user-timings.js` (audit) is the primary file handling user timing measurements and their processing
- `tracing-processor.js` handles trace data processing which includes timing events
- `user-timings.js` (formatter) handles how the timing data is formatted for display
- `event-helpers.js` provides utility functions for processing event data
- `web-inspector.js` provides core functionality for timeline and performance data handling

These files would be involved in the processing chain that converts raw user timing data into displayed values, and the bug causing negative numbers would likely be in their interaction.
