Let me help analyze this issue.

1. Wrong Behavior:
The report page is blank when running Lighthouse, both from command line and as a browser extension, even though the execution appears successful.

2. Cause Analysis:
Based on the screenshot and repository information, this appears to be a report rendering issue. The problem likely stems from either:
- Report generation failure in the core renderer
- Issues with the HTML template or report UI features
- Problems with report data processing before rendering

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-ui-features.js
lighthouse-extension/app/src/popup.js
lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `report-generator.js` is the core file responsible for converting audit results into HTML reports
- `report-renderer.js` handles the actual DOM rendering of the report data
- `report-ui-features.js` manages the UI interactions and display features
- `popup.js` handles the extension's report generation and display
- `lighthouse-report-viewer.js` provides the viewer functionality for displaying reports

The issue is most likely originating from either the report generation or rendering process, which is why the first two files are most critical to investigate.
