Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Lighthouse doesn't handle Out-of-Process iframes (OOPIFs) properly
- While Chrome DevTools can discover and analyze network requests from iframes using Target.sendMessageToTarget and Target.receivedMessageFromTarget, Lighthouse appears to only analyze requests from the main frame

2. Cause Analysis:
- The root cause appears to be that Lighthouse's network request gathering system doesn't implement the Chrome DevTools Protocol's target discovery and messaging system for iframes
- This means Lighthouse is missing network requests that occur within iframes, leading to incomplete analysis
- The functionality would need to be implemented in the gathering phase of Lighthouse's operation

3. Most Relevant Files (ordered by importance):

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/network-recorder.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/chrome-console-messages.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-analyzer.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- network-recorder.js: Primary file for recording network activity and managing request lifecycle
- network-request.js: Core class for handling individual network requests
- chrome-console-messages.js: Handles Chrome DevTools Protocol communication
- network-node.js: Represents network requests in dependency graph
- network-analyzer.js: Analyzes network requests and their relationships

These files would need to be modified to implement iframe target discovery and network request gathering from those targets.
