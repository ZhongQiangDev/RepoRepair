Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Lighthouse is unable to automatically check the font-display value for multiple font URLs loaded from Google Fonts and Disqus
- These warnings appear during audits of iframes, suggesting font-display checks are not working properly for fonts loaded within iframes

2. Cause Analysis:
- The CSSUsage artifact doesn't have any stylesheets referencing these fonts, as mentioned in the issue
- This likely occurs because the font-display audit is not properly gathering CSS usage data from within iframes
- The core issue seems to be in how Lighthouse gathers and processes CSS data across frame boundaries

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, here are the most relevant files ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/css-usage.js
lighthouse-core/audits/font-display.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/iframe-elements.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gather-runner.js
lighthouse-core/config/config.js
```

Reasoning for selection:
- css-usage.js: Primary gatherer for CSS usage data, which is failing to capture stylesheet references from iframes
- font-display.js: The audit that's generating the warnings and relies on CSS usage data
- iframe-elements.js: Responsible for gathering iframe information, which is crucial for cross-frame analysis
- gather-runner.js: Orchestrates the gathering process and could need updates for proper iframe handling
- config.js: May need configuration updates to properly handle cross-frame gathering
