Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The user agent reported in Lighthouse's "Runtime settings" doesn't match the actual user agent seen in the web server's access logs during the test
- This inconsistency appears in both Lighthouse Extension and Chrome DevTools versions, but not in webpagetest.org

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be related to how Lighthouse reports and uses user agents during testing
- There seems to be two different user agents being used:
  - One reported in the runtime settings
  - Another actually used when making requests
- This suggests either:
  - A mismatch in how the user agent is being set vs reported
  - Multiple user agents being used at different stages of the testing process

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling user agents and runtime settings:

```
lighthouse-core/gather/connections/extension.js
lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/chrome-console-messages.js
lighthouse-core/config/config.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gather-runner.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `extension.js` handles the connection and communication with Chrome, including user agent settings
- `emulation.js` manages device emulation settings including user agent configuration
- `chrome-console-messages.js` deals with Chrome-specific messaging and settings
- `config.js` handles configuration settings including runtime settings display
- `gather-runner.js` orchestrates the gathering process which includes applying and using these settings

The fix would likely involve synchronizing the user agent reporting and usage across these components to ensure consistency.
