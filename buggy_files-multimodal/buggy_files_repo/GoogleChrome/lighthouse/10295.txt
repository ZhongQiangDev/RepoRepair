Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The lighthouse audit tool is failing with an error "version.match is not a function" when detecting library versions on some websites, particularly Magento 2 sites.
- This suggests the version detection mechanism is failing to properly handle certain version string formats.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The error indicates that the code is trying to call .match() on a version value that is not a string
- This is likely happening because Magento 2 uses require.js and JS bundling which may affect how Chrome Library Detector identifies library versions
- The version detection code is expecting version values to be strings but is receiving a different data type

3. Most Relevant Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in version detection and library analysis:

```
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/base-node.js
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-recorder.js
```

Reasoning:
- stack-collector.js is directly responsible for gathering information about JavaScript libraries used on a page
- js-libraries.js handles the auditing of JavaScript libraries
- base-node.js and network-node.js handle dependency tracking which is important for bundled JavaScript
- network-recorder.js monitors network activity which could affect how bundled resources are detected

The fix would likely need to focus on stack-collector.js and js-libraries.js to ensure proper type checking and handling of version values before attempting string operations.
