Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- DevTools incorrectly shows "no emulation" for mobile runs in the Lighthouse report
- This is misleading since mobile emulation should be active and indicated

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue stems from #14515 which changed `getEmulationDescriptions` to return "no emulation" when `screenEmulation.disabled` is true
- This setting is being incorrectly set to true in `devtools-entry.js`
- The emulation description logic needs to properly reflect when mobile emulation is active

3. Most Related Files (ordered by importance):
```
core/lib/emulation.js
report/renderer/util.js
core/gather/driver/prepare.js
types/lhr/settings.d.ts
core/gather/gatherers/viewport-dimensions.js
```

Reasoning for file selection:
- `core/lib/emulation.js` is most important as it handles emulation settings and configuration
- `report/renderer/util.js` contains the `getEmulationDescriptions` function that was modified
- `core/gather/driver/prepare.js` handles device emulation preparation
- `types/lhr/settings.d.ts` defines the screen emulation settings types
- `core/gather/gatherers/viewport-dimensions.js` gathers viewport information which is related to emulation
