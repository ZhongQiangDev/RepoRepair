Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- When running Lighthouse reports using headless Chrome, the performance numbers may not be representative of real user experience
- Users are not being warned about this limitation when viewing the report

2. Cause Analysis:
- Performance metrics collected in headless Chrome can differ from regular Chrome due to different resource constraints and environment
- The report generator currently doesn't check or indicate whether the report was generated using headless Chrome
- This information needs to be prominently displayed to users, preferably at the top of the report

3. Most Related Files:
The key files that would need to be modified to implement this warning are:

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
lighthouse-cli/run.ts
lighthouse-core/index.js
lighthouse-core/lib/sentry.js
```

Reasoning:
- report-generator.js: Main file for generating the report structure and content
- report-renderer.js: Handles the rendering of report components and would need to add the warning
- run.ts: Contains the logic for running Lighthouse and detecting headless Chrome
- index.js: Core entry point that handles configuration and execution flags
- sentry.js: Handles error reporting and warnings, could be used to track headless Chrome usage

These files would need to be modified to detect headless Chrome usage and display an appropriate warning in the report.
