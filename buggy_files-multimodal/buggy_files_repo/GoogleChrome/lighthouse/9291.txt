Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The i18n (internationalization) text is not being translated when running the Lighthouse CLI command `node lighthouse-cli www.example.com --view`
- The error message shown in the image appears to be an untranslated string identifier rather than the actual localized message

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be in the i18n message resolution system
- When running in CLI mode, the system is failing to properly resolve the message IDs into their localized strings
- This is likely a problem with either:
  - The i18n initialization in CLI context
  - The message lookup/resolution process
  - The connection between CLI flags and locale settings

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information and the nature of the issue, here are the most relevant files:

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
lighthouse-cli/cli-flags.js
lighthouse-cli/bin.js
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/util.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- `i18n.js` is the core internationalization module handling message resolution
- `cli-flags.js` handles CLI arguments which could affect locale selection
- `bin.js` is the main CLI entry point where i18n should be initialized
- `swap-locale.js` handles locale switching functionality
- `util.js` contains UI string utilities that might be involved in message display
