I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The problem shows a JavaScript syntax highlighting issue where constants in a destructuring assignment are incorrectly recognized as keywords. In the example:

`javascript
const { $from, $from } = selection;
`

The variables `$from` are highlighted as keywords (blue color in the screenshot) when they should be highlighted as variables/constants.

This is a syntax highlighting issue in Prism.js, which is the syntax highlighting library used in the repository. The issue specifically relates to how JavaScript variables with special characters (like `$`) are tokenized and styled.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue is likely in the JavaScript language definition in Prism.js. The tokenizer is incorrectly categorizing variables that start with `$` as keywords instead of variables or identifiers. This could be due to:

1. An incorrect regex pattern in the JavaScript language definition
2. Missing or incorrect token type assignment for variables with special characters
3. A conflict between different token patterns where the keyword pattern is taking precedence over the variable pattern

## Files That Need to Be Edited

```
components/prism-javascript.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-jsx.js
prism.js
```

The most important file is likely `components/prism-javascript.js` (or a similar file that defines JavaScript syntax), as it would contain the core language definition for JavaScript. The `components/prism-js-extras.js` file might contain additional JavaScript-specific highlighting rules. The `components/prism-core.js` contains the core functionality of Prism, and `components/prism-jsx.js` might be relevant if the issue also affects JSX syntax. Finally, `prism.js` is the main file that combines all components.
