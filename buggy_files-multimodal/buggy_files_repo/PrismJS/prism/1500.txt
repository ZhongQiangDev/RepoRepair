I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the SQL comment highlighting issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem shows that in SQL code, when a comment line (`-- this is a comment`) appears between two SQL statements, the syntax highlighting incorrectly treats everything after the comment as part of the comment. In the screenshot, the second SQL INSERT statement is highlighted as if it were still part of the comment, when it should be highlighted as SQL code.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
This appears to be an issue with how Prism.js handles SQL comments. Specifically, the SQL language definition in Prism.js likely has an incorrect regex pattern for single-line comments that doesn't properly terminate at the end of the line. The `--` comment in SQL should only apply until the end of the current line, but the highlighter is treating it as continuing to the end of the code block.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant files would be those related to SQL language definition in Prism.js. However, I don't see a specific `prism-sql.js` file in the provided repository information. The core files that would need to be examined are:

```
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-markup.js
```

Note: The actual file that would need to be edited is likely `components/prism-sql.js`, but it wasn't included in the repository information provided. The SQL language definition file would contain the regex patterns for SQL syntax highlighting, including comments. The issue is specifically with how the `--` comment pattern is defined in that file.
