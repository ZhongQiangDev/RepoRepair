I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with C++ single quote separators in numeric literals.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that Prism.js doesn't properly highlight C++ numeric literals that contain single quotes as separators. For example, in C++, `1'000'000` is a valid integer literal (equivalent to `1000000`), but Prism is incorrectly highlighting parts of these numbers as strings rather than recognizing the entire token as a number.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is in the regular expression patterns used for number detection in C++ syntax highlighting. The current regex patterns for numbers in C++ don't account for the single quote (`'`) character as a valid digit separator in numeric literals. This causes Prism to incorrectly tokenize these numbers, breaking them into separate parts and highlighting some segments as strings.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, the most relevant files that would need to be edited are:

```
components/prism-c.js
components/prism-cpp.js
```

The issue is primarily with how C++ numeric literals are defined. Since C++ extends the C language in Prism (as mentioned in the problem description with `extend('c')` call), we need to modify both the C and C++ language definitions. The C file would contain the base number regex pattern, and the C++ file would extend it.

The problem description mentions trying to modify the regex in `components/prism-cpp.js` to include single quotes in every place where digits could be matched, which is the correct approach. The regex needs to be updated to recognize single quotes as valid separators within numeric literals.
