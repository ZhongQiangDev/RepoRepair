I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to add Mermaid language support to Prism.js.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that Prism.js currently doesn't support syntax highlighting for Mermaid, which is a language for creating diagrams using text and code. Users want to be able to highlight Mermaid code blocks in the same way other languages are highlighted.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
To add a new language to Prism.js, several files need to be modified:
- A new language definition file needs to be created for Mermaid
- The language needs to be registered in the components index
- The language should be added to any relevant configuration files

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
components/prism-mermaid.js
components/index.js
components.json
prism.js
gulpfile.js/index.js
```

The most important file would be `components/prism-mermaid.js`, which needs to be created to define the Mermaid language syntax highlighting rules. This file doesn't exist yet and would need to be created from scratch.

The `components/index.js` file would need to be updated to include the new Mermaid language in the loadable languages.

The `components.json` file likely contains metadata about all supported languages and would need to be updated to include Mermaid.

The core `prism.js` file might need modifications to recognize the new language.

The `gulpfile.js/index.js` file handles the build process and might need updates to include the new language component in the build.
