I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves Visual Basic comments not highlighting correctly when line continuation characters are used. In Visual Basic, the underscore character (`_`) at the end of a line indicates that the statement continues on the next line. The screenshot shows that when a comment (starting with `'`) uses a line continuation, the syntax highlighting breaks - the second line is not properly highlighted as a comment.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is likely in how Prism.js tokenizes Visual Basic comments. Currently, it seems that the tokenizer treats each line as a separate entity and doesn't recognize that a comment with a line continuation should be treated as a single token spanning multiple lines. The tokenizer needs to be modified to detect the underscore at the end of a commented line and continue the comment highlighting to the next line.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, I need to find the file that defines the Visual Basic language syntax for Prism.js. However, the Visual Basic language definition file isn't explicitly listed in the provided repository information. Based on Prism.js's structure, language definitions are typically in files named `prism-[language].js` in the components directory.

Since we don't see a specific Visual Basic file in the provided information, I'll list the most likely files that would need to be edited or created:

```
components/prism-vb.js
components/prism-visual-basic.js
components/prism-basic.js
prism.js
components/prism-core.js
```

The most likely scenario is that a file named `prism-vb.js` or `prism-visual-basic.js` exists in the components directory but wasn't included in the repository information. This file would need to be modified to handle line continuations in comments. If such a file doesn't exist, it would need to be created.

If there's no dedicated Visual Basic language file, then the core Prism.js file might contain the Visual Basic language definition, or it might need to be added.
