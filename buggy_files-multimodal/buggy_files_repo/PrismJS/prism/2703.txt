I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves F# syntax highlighting in Prism.js. Specifically, when using the multiplication operator as a function with parentheses `(*)`, the syntax highlighter incorrectly treats it as the start of a multi-line comment `(*...*)` instead of recognizing it as a function.

## Analyzing the Cause
In F#, multi-line comments are denoted by `(* ... *)`, similar to OCaml. However, F# also allows using operators as functions by wrapping them in parentheses, like `(*)` for multiplication. The current Prism.js implementation for F# is incorrectly interpreting `(*)` as the start of a comment rather than recognizing it as a function application of the multiplication operator.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Looking at the repository information, I need to find the file that defines the F# language syntax highlighting rules. Since the problem is specifically with F# syntax highlighting, I need to look for the F# language definition file in the components directory.

```
components/prism-fsharp.js
```

This is the only file that would need to be edited to fix the issue. The file would contain the regex patterns for F# syntax highlighting, including the pattern for multi-line comments that needs to be modified to exclude the `(*)` case when it's used as a function.
