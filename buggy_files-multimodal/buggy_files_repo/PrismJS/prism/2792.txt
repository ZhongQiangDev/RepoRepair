I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with ANSI-C quoting highlighting in Bash.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem involves incorrect syntax highlighting for ANSI-C quoting in Bash. In the example, a string that uses `$'...'` syntax (ANSI-C quoting) contains escape sequences like `\n` that are not being highlighted properly. The reference image from zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting shows how it should look, with proper highlighting of the escape sequences.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue appears to be in the Bash language definition for Prism.js. The current implementation likely doesn't properly handle ANSI-C quoted strings (strings that start with `$'`) or doesn't correctly highlight escape sequences within these strings. The `\n` escape sequences are tripping up the highlighting, suggesting that the regex patterns for string handling in Bash need to be updated to properly recognize and highlight ANSI-C quoting.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

```
components/prism-bash.js
components/prism-core.js
```

The primary file that needs to be edited is `components/prism-bash.js`, which contains the language definition for Bash syntax highlighting. This file would need to be updated to properly handle ANSI-C quoting and escape sequences within these quotes.

The `components/prism-core.js` file might also be relevant as it contains the core functionality of Prism.js, but the issue is most likely specific to the Bash language definition rather than the core functionality.
