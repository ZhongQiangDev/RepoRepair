I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that F# type annotations are not being highlighted in the syntax highlighting. In the provided screenshot, we can see that type annotations (like `: int`) are not receiving any special highlighting, whereas in the desired result (Visual Studio screenshot), these type annotations are highlighted differently.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue is likely in the F# language definition for Prism.js. The syntax highlighting rules for F# are not properly configured to recognize and highlight type annotations. Type annotations in F# typically follow a colon (`:`) and specify the data type of a variable or function return value.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Looking at the repository information, I need to identify where the F# language definition would be located. Since this is a Prism.js issue, and Prism.js organizes language definitions in separate files, I would expect to find an F# language definition file.

However, the repository information provided doesn't explicitly mention an F# language file. Based on the pattern of other language files (like `prism-ruby.js`, `prism-kotlin.js`, etc.), I would expect the F# language definition to be in a file named something like `prism-fsharp.js`.

The most relevant files would be:

```
components/prism-fsharp.js
components/index.js
prism.js
```

Note: Since the repository information doesn't explicitly show an F# language file, I'm making an educated guess that it would be named `prism-fsharp.js` based on the naming pattern of other language files. If this file doesn't exist, then the issue might be that F# support needs to be added entirely, or it might be included in another language file.
