I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with cshtml code highlighting.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that Prism.js is incorrectly highlighting various parts of Razor/cshtml code. Specifically:
- Helper syntax (`@helper TrialHelper(string name)`) is not properly highlighted
- C# attributes and expressions within HTML attributes (like `@Localize.GetLabelHtml("PLACEHOLDER")`) are highlighted incorrectly
- The syntax highlighting doesn't match what Visual Studio shows for the same code

## Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the screenshots, I can see that:
1. The C# code blocks and expressions are not being properly recognized
2. The `@helper` directive is not being highlighted as a keyword
3. The C# expressions inside HTML attributes are not being parsed correctly
4. The nested structure of Razor/cshtml (mixing HTML and C#) is causing issues with the tokenizer

This suggests problems with the cshtml language definition in Prism.js, particularly how it handles:
- Razor syntax (`@` expressions)
- Helper directives
- Nested C# code within HTML attributes
- The overall tokenization of mixed HTML/C# content

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
components/prism-cshtml.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-csharp.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-markup-templating.js
```

The `components/prism-cshtml.js` file is the primary file that needs to be modified as it contains the specific language definition for cshtml/Razor. The issue is likely in how it defines patterns for Razor syntax elements.

The `components/prism-markup.js` and `components/prism-csharp.js` files are also important as cshtml combines HTML markup with C# code, and the interaction between these language definitions might be causing issues.

The `components/prism-core.js` contains the core tokenization logic that might need adjustments to properly handle the mixed language nature of cshtml.

Finally, `components/prism-markup-templating.js` is relevant because Razor is essentially a templating language that embeds C# within HTML, and this file handles how templating languages are processed.
