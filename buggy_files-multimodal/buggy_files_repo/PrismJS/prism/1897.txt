I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The issue is with Markdown syntax highlighting in Prism.js, specifically with how italic punctuation is handled. The problem shows that when using nested formatting like `*__foo__*` or `_**bar**_`, the italic markers (`*` or `_`) are being applied too greedily, causing incorrect highlighting as shown in the screenshot.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is in the regular expression pattern used for matching italic text in Markdown. The current pattern is too greedy and doesn't properly handle nested formatting. The suggested fix in the issue description proposes modifying the pattern to be more specific about what it matches, particularly by using a lookbehind assertion and properly grouping the punctuation.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, the most relevant files are:

```
components/prism-markdown.js
```

This is the only file that needs to be modified to fix the issue. The problem is specifically with the Markdown language definition in Prism.js, and the fix involves updating the regular expression pattern for italic text as suggested in the issue description.

The issue is related to how Prism.js handles Markdown syntax highlighting, and the `prism-markdown.js` file contains the patterns for Markdown formatting, including the problematic italic pattern that needs to be fixed according to the proposed solution in the issue description.
