I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem shows that Prism.js is incorrectly identifying the `type` attribute in a TypeScript interface as a keyword. In the example, the interface property `type?: string;` is being highlighted as if `type` were a TypeScript keyword rather than a property name.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is likely in the TypeScript language definition for Prism.js. The syntax highlighter is incorrectly treating the word "type" as a keyword in all contexts, including when it's used as a property name in an interface or type definition. 

This happens because "type" is indeed a TypeScript keyword (used for type declarations like `type MyType = string`), but it should not be highlighted as a keyword when used as a property name in an interface or object.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
components/prism-typescript.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-clike.js
components/prism-javascript.js
```

The primary file that needs modification is `components/prism-typescript.js` since it contains the TypeScript-specific language definition. The issue is likely in how keywords are defined or how property names are detected in TypeScript interfaces.

The `prism-js-extras.js` file is also important as it extends JavaScript highlighting with additional features that might affect TypeScript.

The other files provide the foundation for JavaScript-like language highlighting that TypeScript builds upon, so they might contain relevant patterns that need adjustment to fix this specific issue.
