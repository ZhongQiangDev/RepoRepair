I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that quotes inside HTML attribute values are being highlighted as punctuation in the language-markup component of Prism.js. In the example:
```html
<google-chart data='[["Month", "Days"], ["Jan", 31]]'></google-chart>
```
The quotes inside the `data` attribute value are highlighted as punctuation, which may not be the intended behavior.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is likely in how Prism.js processes HTML attribute values. When parsing HTML markup, the syntax highlighter is treating quotes inside attribute values as punctuation tokens rather than as part of the string content. This suggests that the HTML attribute value tokenization logic needs to be modified to handle nested quotes differently.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
components/prism-markup.js
prism.js
```

The `components/prism-markup.js` file is the most important because it contains the logic for HTML attribute handling and syntax highlighting. This is where the tokenization rules for HTML attributes are defined, including how quotes within attribute values are processed.

The `prism.js` file is also relevant as it contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization pipeline and hooks that might affect how attribute values are processed.

The issue specifically relates to how quotes inside HTML attribute values are tokenized, and these files contain the logic responsible for that behavior.
