I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with JavaScript numeric separators.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that Prism.js is not correctly highlighting JavaScript numeric literals that use numeric separators (underscores). For example, numbers like `1_000_000_000_000` and `1_019_436_871.42` are not being properly highlighted as numeric literals.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
JavaScript numeric separators (introduced in ES2021) allow underscores (`_`) to be used as separators in numeric literals to improve readability of large numbers. The current Prism.js implementation likely doesn't recognize these underscores as valid parts of numeric literals in its regex patterns for number detection.

The issue would be in the JavaScript language definition files where number patterns are defined. The regex patterns for detecting numbers need to be updated to account for underscores as valid separators within numeric literals.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified:

```
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-javascript.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-jsx.js
components/prism-typescript.js
```

Note: While `components/prism-javascript.js` isn't explicitly listed in the repository information you provided, it would be the primary file to modify since it would contain the JavaScript language definition. The other files are listed based on their likely relevance to JavaScript syntax highlighting, with core functionality files and JavaScript-related extensions being the most important.
