I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that the Prism.js highlight demo on the project homepage is broken. Specifically, when scrolling down to about 90% of the page, a back tick breaks the following code. The screenshot shows that the syntax highlighting is breaking at a code example that contains backticks.

## Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the test page URL and the screenshot, I can see this is happening in a JavaScript code example that contains template literals (using backticks). The issue appears to be in how Prism.js handles backticks within code examples, particularly when they're used to demonstrate template literals in JavaScript.

The problem is likely in the core JavaScript language definition or in the template string handling. Based on the screenshot, it seems that a backtick within a code example (possibly within a comment that's explaining template literals) is being incorrectly interpreted as the start or end of a template string, breaking the syntax highlighting.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
components/prism-javascript.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-clike.js
plugins/file-highlight/prism-file-highlight.js
```

The issue is most likely in `prism-javascript.js` which defines the JavaScript language syntax highlighting rules, particularly around template strings. The `prism-core.js` file contains the core tokenization logic. The `prism-markup.js` file might be relevant if the issue involves how code is displayed within HTML. The `prism-clike.js` file is the base for JavaScript highlighting. Finally, the file highlight plugin might be involved if the issue occurs when loading example code.
