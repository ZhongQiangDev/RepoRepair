I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with Smalltalk empty strings.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that Prism.js is not correctly handling empty strings in Smalltalk syntax highlighting. In the example:
```
anObject withEmptyString: ''  shouldNotBeGreenHere: 'shouldBeGreenHere'
```
The empty string `''` is not being properly recognized and highlighted, while the non-empty string `'shouldBeGreenHere'` is correctly highlighted.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
Based on the screenshots provided:
- In Prism.js (incorrect behavior), the empty string `''` is not being highlighted as a string, causing the subsequent text to be incorrectly highlighted.
- In Rouge (correct behavior), both the empty string `''` and the non-empty string `'shouldBeGreenHere'` are properly highlighted.

This suggests that the issue is in the regular expression pattern used to match Smalltalk strings in Prism.js. The pattern likely doesn't properly account for empty strings (two consecutive single quotes with nothing in between).

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Since this is specifically about Smalltalk syntax highlighting, we need to look for the file that defines the Smalltalk language grammar in Prism.js. Although the repository information doesn't explicitly mention a Smalltalk-specific file, based on the naming convention of other language files (e.g., `prism-ruby.js`, `prism-java.js`), the most relevant file would be:

```
components/prism-smalltalk.js
```

This file would contain the language definition for Smalltalk, including the string pattern that needs to be fixed. Since this file isn't explicitly mentioned in the repository information, it's the only file I can confidently identify as needing modification.
