I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that in Ruby code, interpolation within regex literals using the `/foo#{bar}/` syntax is not being properly highlighted, while interpolation in regex using the `%r{foo#{bar}}` syntax works correctly.

Looking at the screenshot, we can see that in the first example (`/foo#{bar}/`), the `#{bar}` part is not highlighted as interpolation, while in the second example (`%r[foo#{bar}]`), the `#{bar}` part is correctly highlighted.

This suggests that the Ruby language definition in Prism.js doesn't properly handle string interpolation within the standard regex literal syntax (`/.../`), but does handle it correctly in the alternative `%r` syntax.

## Files to Edit

Based on the repository information, the most relevant file would be the one that defines Ruby syntax highlighting rules. Since the issue is specifically with regex interpolation in Ruby, I need to look at the Ruby language definition file:

```
components/prism-ruby.js
```

This is the only file that needs to be modified to fix this issue. The problem is likely in how regex patterns are defined in the Ruby language definition, specifically how interpolation is handled within the standard regex literal syntax (`/.../`).
