I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that Java doesn't highlight single-package package names. In the example, `package baz;` and `import foo.Bar;` are shown, but the package name "baz" and the package part of the import "foo" are not being highlighted properly, as shown in the screenshot.

## Analyzing the Cause
This appears to be an issue with the Java syntax highlighting in Prism.js. Specifically, the Java language definition likely doesn't properly handle single-word package names in package declarations and imports. The syntax highlighting rules for namespaces/packages in Java need to be updated to correctly identify and highlight these single-word package names.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
components/prism-java.js
components/prism-core.js
components/index.js
```

The `components/prism-java.js` file is the most important as it contains the Java language definition for Prism.js, including the patterns for highlighting package names and imports. This is where the fix would need to be implemented.

The `components/prism-core.js` file is the core of Prism.js and might be relevant if there are fundamental issues with how token patterns are processed.

The `components/index.js` file handles loading language definitions, which might be useful if the Java language definition needs to be reloaded or if dependencies need to be managed.
