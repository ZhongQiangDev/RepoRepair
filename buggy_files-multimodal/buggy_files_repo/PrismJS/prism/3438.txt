I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that URL strings in CSS are being highlighted incorrectly. In the expected behavior, the entire URL string should be highlighted as a single unit, but in the actual behavior, parts of the URL are being highlighted differently, breaking the URL into separate segments.

## Analyzing the Cause
Looking at the example:
`
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');
`

The issue appears to be with how Prism.js is tokenizing URL strings in CSS. The URL contains special characters like `:`, `/`, `?`, `=`, `;`, and `&` which might be incorrectly recognized as operators or punctuation rather than being treated as part of the URL string.

This is likely happening in the CSS language definition where the URL pattern isn't properly handling all the characters that can appear in a URL string.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
components/prism-css.js
components/prism-css-extras.js
plugins/autolinker/prism-autolinker.js
```

The primary file that needs to be edited is `components/prism-css.js` as it contains the core CSS language definition for Prism.js, including how URLs are tokenized. The issue is likely in the regex pattern for URLs that's not properly handling all valid URL characters.

The `components/prism-css-extras.js` file might also need modification as it extends the CSS language definition with additional patterns.

The `plugins/autolinker/prism-autolinker.js` could be relevant if it's interfering with URL highlighting by trying to convert URLs into links.
