I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The GitHub problem description is requesting language support for PlantUML in the Prism.js syntax highlighter. PlantUML is a text-based format for creating UML diagrams. Currently, it appears that Prism.js doesn't have built-in support for highlighting PlantUML syntax.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The cause is simply that PlantUML language support hasn't been implemented yet in the Prism.js library. To add support for a new language in Prism.js, we need to:

1. Create a new language definition file for PlantUML
2. Define the appropriate syntax patterns (keywords, comments, strings, etc.)
3. Register the language with Prism

Based on the example provided in the description, we need to highlight PlantUML-specific keywords like `@startuml`, `@enduml`, `participant`, `actor`, etc., and support for the arrow syntax (`->`) used in sequence diagrams.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, I need to identify the most relevant files for implementing a new language in Prism.js:

```
components/prism-core.js
gulpfile.js/index.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-clike.js
gulpfile.js/components.js
```

Explanation:

1. `components/prism-core.js` - This is the core file of Prism.js that contains the fundamental functionality for language definitions and syntax highlighting.

2. `gulpfile.js/index.js` - This file contains build tasks including minification and processing of language components. It's important for integrating a new language component into the build process.

3. `components/prism-markup.js` - This provides a reference for how markup languages are implemented, which is relevant since PlantUML has some markup-like characteristics.

4. `components/prism-clike.js` - Many language definitions in Prism extend from C-like syntax. While PlantUML isn't C-like, this file provides a good reference for how language definitions are structured.

5. `gulpfile.js/components.js` - This file likely handles the registration and configuration of language components, which would be necessary for adding PlantUML support.

To implement PlantUML support, we would need to create a new file `components/prism-plantuml.js` that defines the language grammar and registers it with Prism.
