I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem description shows that Markdown image syntax (`![emoji](https://content.markdowner.net/emoji/g/64/1f44d.png)`) is not being properly rendered. The image is shown as raw Markdown syntax rather than being displayed as an actual image.

## Analyzing the Cause
This appears to be a feature request to add support for Markdown image tokens in the Prism.js syntax highlighter. Currently, the Markdown language definition in Prism.js likely doesn't have proper handling for image syntax, which uses the `![alt text](url)` format.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
components/prism-markdown.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/autoloader/prism-autoloader.js
components/index.js
prism.js
```

The `components/prism-markdown.js` file is the most important as it would contain the language definition for Markdown and would need to be updated to properly handle image syntax. The other files are supporting files that might need adjustments to ensure the new image token functionality works correctly throughout the system.
