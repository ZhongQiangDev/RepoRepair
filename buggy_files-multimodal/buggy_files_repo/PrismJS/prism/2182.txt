I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that Prism.js doesn't correctly highlight Elixir attributes that end with a question mark (`?`). As shown in the screenshot and code example, attributes like `attribute?` are not being properly recognized as tokens in the syntax highlighting.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The issue is in the regular expression pattern used to identify attribute names in Elixir. According to the GitHub issue, the current pattern doesn't include the optional question mark at the end of attribute names. The suggested fix is to change the pattern from what's currently in the code to `'attr-name': /\w+?\?:(?!:)/,` to properly match attribute names that end with a question mark.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information provided, the most important file that needs to be edited is:

```
components/prism-elixir.js
```

This is the only file that needs to be modified to fix the issue. The file contains the Elixir language definition for Prism.js, and specifically the regular expression pattern for attribute names needs to be updated to include the optional question mark at the end.
