I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that TypeScript keywords like `infer` and `type` are being incorrectly highlighted as keywords when they appear as part of identifiers (like `inference` or `typeDefs`) in import statements. This is incorrect behavior, as these should only be highlighted as keywords when they're used as actual keywords, not when they're part of variable names.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is likely in the TypeScript/TSX syntax highlighting rules in Prism.js. The regex patterns for keywords like `infer` and `type` are probably not properly bounded, meaning they match these words even when they're part of larger identifiers. The patterns need to be modified to only match these words when they're standalone keywords (using word boundaries or similar techniques).

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
components/prism-typescript.js
components/prism-tsx.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-core.js
```

The issue is most likely in `prism-typescript.js` since that's the primary file defining TypeScript syntax highlighting rules. The `prism-tsx.js` file extends TypeScript for JSX syntax and might also need modification. The `prism-js-extras.js` file contains additional JavaScript highlighting rules that might affect TypeScript, and `prism-core.js` contains the core functionality that all language definitions build upon.
