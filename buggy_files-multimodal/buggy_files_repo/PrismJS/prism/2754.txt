I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with JSX component syntax highlighting when spreading props.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that in JSX components, when using the spread operator to pass props (e.g., `<Button {...{onClick, disabled}}>`), the syntax highlighting breaks. The example shows that while regular prop assignment (`onClick={onClick}`) is highlighted correctly, the spread syntax causes incorrect highlighting.

## Analyzing the Cause
The problem appears to be in Prism's JSX language definition. When parsing JSX attributes, the syntax highlighter doesn't properly handle the spread operator syntax (`{...object}`) within component attributes. This is likely because the regex patterns or token definitions for JSX attributes don't account for this specific syntax pattern.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
components/prism-jsx.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-javascript.js
```

The `components/prism-jsx.js` file is the most critical as it contains the JSX language definition and would need to be modified to properly handle the spread operator in component attributes. The other files provide supporting functionality that might need adjustments to ensure the fix works correctly throughout the syntax highlighting pipeline.
