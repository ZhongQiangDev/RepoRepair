I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with D language string highlighting.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves incorrect string highlighting in the D programming language. Specifically:
- When single quotes are used within double-quoted strings (e.g., `"It's"`), the syntax highlighting breaks incorrectly.
- The issue is visible in the provided screenshot where the string highlighting is interrupted at the apostrophe.
- Additionally, the description mentions backtick strings (``) which should be treated as WYSIWYG strings in D (similar to raw strings in other languages).

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The cause appears to be in the D language definition for Prism.js. The syntax highlighter is likely:
1. Incorrectly interpreting single quotes within double-quoted strings as string terminators
2. Not properly handling backtick strings as WYSIWYG strings
3. Missing or having incorrect regex patterns for D language string literals

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, the most relevant files would be those related to D language syntax highlighting. Since Prism.js organizes language definitions in separate files, we need to find the D language component.

```
components/prism-d.js
prism.js
components/index.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-clike.js
```

The most important file would be `components/prism-d.js` which would contain the D language definition. If this file doesn't exist in the provided information, it means it's either missing from the repository or wasn't included in the description. In that case, we would need to create this file or modify the core files to add D language support.

The `prism.js` file is the main file that includes all language definitions. The `components/index.js` file manages language loading. The `components/prism-core.js` contains the core functionality, and `components/prism-clike.js` might be relevant if D language definition extends from C-like languages.
