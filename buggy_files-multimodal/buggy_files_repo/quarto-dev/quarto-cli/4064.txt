I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that when using percentage values for `width` and `height` in a RevealJS presentation format, the presentation doesn't appear (blank screen). However, when using pixel values, it works correctly.

Looking at the example:
`yaml
format: 
  revealjs:
    theme: default
    width: "100%"
    height: "100%"
`

The problem appears to be that percentage values need to be quoted in YAML, but somewhere in the Quarto processing pipeline, these quoted values aren't being handled correctly when generating the RevealJS presentation.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue is likely in how Quarto processes and passes the `width` and `height` parameters to the RevealJS template. When percentage values are quoted in the YAML front matter, the quotes might be retained in the final output, causing RevealJS to not recognize them as valid CSS percentage values.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information provided, here are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-theme.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-plugin.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-multiplex.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-title.ts
```

The most important file is likely `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts` as it appears to be the main file handling RevealJS format configuration. This file would contain the logic for processing the format options and passing them to the RevealJS template.

The other files are related to different aspects of RevealJS formatting and might also be involved in processing these parameters, especially if they handle theme or layout-related configurations.
