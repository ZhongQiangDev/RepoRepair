I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves the combination of `.panel-tabset` and `.nav-fill` classes not working correctly in the prerelease version (1.3.146) compared to the previous version (1.2.335). 

In the older version, the tabs fill the entire width of the container, but in the newer version, they don't. The user found a workaround by nesting the classes differently:
`
:::{.nav-fill}
:::{.panel-tabset}
`
instead of 
`
:::{.panel-tabset .nav-fill}
`

This suggests that the issue is related to how these CSS classes are being processed or applied in the HTML output. The problem is likely in the code that handles Bootstrap-related classes in panel-tabsets.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue appears to be that the `.nav-fill` class is not being properly applied to the navigation element in the tabset when specified alongside `.panel-tabset`. This is likely due to changes in how class attributes are processed or how the HTML for tabsets is generated in the newer version.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/format/html/format-html-bootstrap.ts
src/format/html/format-html.ts
src/core/html.ts
src/resources/formats/html/quarto.js
src/command/render/pandoc-html.ts
```

The issue is most likely in the HTML formatting and Bootstrap integration code, particularly in how panel-tabsets are processed and how CSS classes are applied to the navigation elements. These files handle HTML formatting, Bootstrap integration, and DOM manipulation, which are all relevant to the tabset rendering issue.
