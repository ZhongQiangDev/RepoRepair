I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that when using a URL for the `source` parameter in `code-tools` (e.g., `source: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/index.md`), the code-tools menu doesn't appear in the rendered HTML output. However, when using `source: true`, the code-tools menu appears correctly.

This suggests that the code responsible for processing the `code-tools` configuration isn't properly handling URL values for the `source` parameter. The system likely expects either a boolean value or isn't correctly processing URL strings.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/command/render/codetools.ts
src/format/html/format-html-shared.ts
src/command/render/render.ts
src/command/render/render-shared.ts
src/command/render/defaults.ts
```

The primary file is `src/command/render/codetools.ts` which contains the `codeToolsPostprocessor` function and `resolveCodeTools` function that handle code tools configuration. This is where the issue with URL handling for the `source` parameter likely exists.

The other files are supporting files that interact with the code tools functionality and may need minor adjustments to properly handle URL values throughout the rendering pipeline.
