I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Understanding the Problem

The issue is that using `hash-type: number` in a revealjs presentation causes misalignment on the title slide, while `hash-type: title` works fine. The screenshots show that with `hash-type: number`, the title content is shifted to the left side of the slide rather than being centered properly.

## Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be related to how the hash-type setting affects the layout or styling of the title slide in revealjs presentations. Based on the screenshots, it seems that when `hash-type: number` is used, it's causing the title slide content to lose its centering.

This is likely happening because:
1. The `hash-type` parameter is affecting how the presentation is initialized
2. This is specifically impacting the title slide's layout or CSS classes
3. The issue only occurs with the "number" value, not with "title"

## Most Relevant Files

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-title.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins/support/support.js
src/core/hash.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-plugin.ts
```

The primary issue is likely in the title slide handling code in `format-reveal-title.ts` or in how the hash-type parameter affects the initialization in `format-reveal.ts`. The support plugin might be applying different classes based on the hash-type. The `hash.ts` file would contain the core hash handling logic, and the plugin file might be involved in how different hash types are processed.
