I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves non-standard URLs (containing commas and other punctuation) that display correctly inline within a blog post but don't display properly in the image grid view. Specifically:

1. The image with URL `http://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57bf31396a6acdf3485df7f9/5:4/w_1028,c_limit/koji-steak-1.jpg` displays fine in the post content
2. But this same image doesn't display correctly in the grid view

The problem appears to be related to how Quarto handles URLs with special characters (like commas) when generating image previews for the grid view.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue is likely related to how Quarto processes image URLs when generating thumbnails or previews for the grid view. The URL contains special characters (commas, slashes) that might not be properly encoded or handled when used in the grid context, even though they work fine in the main content.

## Most Relevant Files

Based on the repository information, these are the most likely files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing.ts
src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing-shared.ts
src/resources/projects/website/listing/quarto-listing.js
src/core/url.ts
src/core/http.ts
```

These files are responsible for handling URLs, image processing, and grid/listing views in Quarto. The issue is most likely in how URLs are processed when generating the grid view, particularly in the listing components that handle image previews.
