I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the excessive vertical space before definition/theorem environments in LaTeX output.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves excessive vertical space appearing before definition/theorem/etc. environments in LaTeX output. From the description and images, we can see:

1. There's too much vertical space before environments like definitions, theorems, and examples
2. The generated LaTeX code includes `\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{def-def}{}}%` before these environments
3. There's also an issue with the QED symbol (proof box) placement being too low, caused by an empty line between the end of the proof text and the `\end{proof}` tag

## Cause of the Problem

1. The main cause appears to be the insertion of `\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{def-def}{}}%` before definition/theorem environments, which is adding unwanted vertical space
2. The secondary issue with the QED symbol is caused by an empty line before `\end{proof}` in the generated LaTeX

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/command/render/filters.ts
src/command/render/pandoc.ts
src/resources/filters/quarto-pre.lua
src/resources/filters/quarto-post.lua
src/command/render/latexmk/latex.ts
```

The first two files are most critical as they handle the rendering process and filter application in Quarto. The Lua filter files likely contain the code that's inserting the problematic LaTeX commands. The last file deals with LaTeX-specific processing which could be relevant for the QED symbol placement issue.
