I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves callout blocks in Quarto documents when rendered to PDF. There are two main problems:

1. **Markdown in callout captions is not processed**: When using markdown formatting (like code backticks, bold text) in callout captions, the markdown is not processed and appears as raw text in the PDF output.

2. **Special characters in captions cause LaTeX errors**: Characters like commas (`,`) in captions are causing LaTeX errors because they're inserted directly into the LaTeX command without proper escaping, causing them to be interpreted as new options in the tcolorbox environment.

## Cause of the Issue

The root cause is in the Lua filter that handles callout blocks for PDF output. The filter:
1. Uses `pandoc.utils.stringify()` on the caption content, which converts it to plain text without processing markdown
2. Inserts the caption text directly into the LaTeX command without proper escaping or wrapping in braces

## Files That Need to Be Modified

Based on the repository information and the proposed changes in the GitHub issue, here are the most relevant files:

```
src/resources/filters/quarto-pre/callout.lua
```

This is the only file that needs to be modified to fix the issue. The proposed changes in the GitHub issue show two specific modifications needed:

1. Wrap the title in braces in the `latexCalloutBoxDefault` function to prevent LaTeX from interpreting commas as new options:
`diff
title = '{' .. caption .. '}',
`

2. Replace `pandoc.utils.stringify()` with `pandoc.write()` in the `calloutLatex` function to properly process markdown in the caption:
`diff
caption = pandoc.write(pandoc.Pandoc(pandoc.Para(caption)), FORMAT)
`

These changes will ensure that markdown in callout captions is properly processed and that special characters in captions don't cause LaTeX errors.
