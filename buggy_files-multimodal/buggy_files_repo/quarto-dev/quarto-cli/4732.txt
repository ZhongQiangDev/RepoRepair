I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that when using the `embed` engine in a Quarto revealjs document, the embedded code from an external file is not displayed in the output. Specifically:

1. When using `{embed, file = "code.R"}` in a revealjs document, the code is not shown in the HTML output
2. The generated HTML contains an empty div with the data-file attribute but no content
3. The same embed functionality works correctly in non-revealjs formats

This suggests an issue with how the `embed` engine from knitr is processed specifically in the revealjs format.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem appears to be related to how the knitr embed engine is handled during the rendering process for revealjs presentations. The embed engine is responsible for including external file content, but something in the revealjs-specific processing is preventing the embedded content from being properly rendered.

Based on the repository information, the issue likely involves:
1. How knitr's embed engine is processed in Quarto
2. How revealjs format specifically handles or fails to handle embedded content
3. The rendering pipeline for code blocks in presentations

## Most Related Files

```
src/core/knitr.ts
src/command/render/render.ts
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
src/command/render/codetools.ts
src/command/render/pandoc-dependencies-html.ts
```

The `src/core/knitr.ts` file is most important as it likely contains the core functionality for handling knitr-specific features including the embed engine.

The `src/command/render/render.ts` file is critical as it manages the overall rendering process and would be involved in how different engines are processed.

The `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts` file is specifically related to the revealjs format, which is where the issue is occurring.

The `src/command/render/codetools.ts` file handles code display and processing, which would be relevant to how embedded code is rendered.

The `src/command/render/pandoc-dependencies-html.ts` file deals with HTML dependencies and transformations, which could affect how embedded content is processed in the final HTML output.
