I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with markdown styling in table captions.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that Quarto does not process markdown syntax (like _italics_ or ^superscript^) in table captions, while it does correctly process the same syntax in figure captions.

From the provided example and .md file excerpt, we can see that:
1. The table caption is wrapped in a div with class `tbl-cap` but the markdown syntax is not being processed
2. The figure caption is correctly processing the same markdown syntax
3. The issue appears to be in how table captions are handled during the rendering process

## Cause of the Issue

The problem likely occurs during the HTML post-processing phase. Table captions are being placed inside a div that isn't being processed for markdown syntax, while figure captions are properly processed. This suggests that the code responsible for handling table captions isn't applying markdown processing to the caption text.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/command/render/pandoc.ts
src/command/render/codetools.ts
src/command/render/render-files.ts
src/command/render/layout.ts
src/core/pandoc/pandoc-attr.ts
```

The issue is most likely in the Pandoc rendering pipeline, particularly in how table captions are processed compared to figure captions. The `pandoc.ts` file contains the core rendering logic, while `codetools.ts` handles code-related elements including tables. The `render-files.ts` file manages the overall rendering process, and `layout.ts` deals with document layout including captions. Finally, `pandoc-attr.ts` handles Pandoc attributes which may affect how captions are processed.
