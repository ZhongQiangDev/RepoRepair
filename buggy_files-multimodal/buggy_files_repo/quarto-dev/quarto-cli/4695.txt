I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that links in `index.qmd` files aren't being resolved properly when published to Confluence. Specifically:

1. When a user creates links in an `index.qmd` file (like `[January](2022-01.qmd)` and `[March](2022-03.qmd)`), they work fine in local preview.
2. However, when published to Confluence, these links don't appear at all.

This suggests a problem with how relative links in `index.qmd` files are processed during the Confluence publishing process.

## Cause Analysis

The issue likely stems from how the Confluence publisher handles links in `index.qmd` files. The problem appears to be specific to Confluence output, as the links work correctly in local preview. This suggests that either:

1. The link resolution mechanism for Confluence publishing isn't properly handling links in `index.qmd` files
2. There might be a transformation issue when converting Quarto markdown to Confluence's storage format
3. The Confluence publisher might be treating `index.qmd` files differently than other files

## Files That Need Editing

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/publish/confluence/confluence-helper.ts
src/publish/confluence/api/index.ts
src/publish/confluence/confluence.ts
src/publish/confluence/api/types.ts
src/publish/common/publish.ts
```

The issue is most likely in the Confluence publishing code, particularly in how it processes links in `index.qmd` files. The `confluence-helper.ts` file contains functions for updating links and transforming content, making it the most likely place for the fix. The other files support the Confluence publishing process and might need adjustments depending on the exact nature of the fix required.
