I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue occurs when using Theorems and Proofs with code blocks but without a header/label. This causes the Lua filter to error out with:

```
Error running filter /Applications/quarto/share/filters/crossref/crossref.lua:97: bad argument #1 to 'insert' (table expected, got nil)
```

The error happens specifically in the crossref.lua filter at line 97, where it's trying to insert something into a table that is nil. This suggests that when a theorem or proof block contains a code block but doesn't have a proper header/label, the filter fails to handle this case correctly.

The error message indicates that the issue is in the crossref Lua filter, which is responsible for handling cross-references in Quarto documents. The filter is expecting a table to insert content into, but is receiving nil instead.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/core/pandoc/filters.ts
src/command/render/crossref.ts
package/src/common/prepare-dist.ts
package/src/common/package-filters.ts
src/command/render/render-files.ts
```

The first two files are directly related to the crossref filter functionality in Quarto. The `crossref.ts` file likely contains the configuration and setup for the crossref filter, while `filters.ts` would handle the general filter processing.

The `prepare-dist.ts` and `package-filters.ts` files are related to how filters are packaged and distributed with Quarto, which would be important if we need to modify how the filter is built or included.

The `render-files.ts` file is likely involved in the rendering process that uses these filters, and might need adjustments to handle error cases better.
