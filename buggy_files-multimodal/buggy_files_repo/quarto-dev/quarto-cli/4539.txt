I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem involves a Quarto document with a GT table that uses a spanner (column grouping header). When a caption is added to the table using Quarto's `tbl-cap` option, the table formatting breaks. The images show:

- Current output: The table appears with incorrect formatting - the spanner header is misaligned and the caption is not properly displayed.
- Desired output: A properly formatted table with the spanner header correctly aligned and the caption properly displayed.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue appears to be related to how Quarto processes GT tables with spanners when a caption is added. Based on the description, this is "either CSS or our table processing failing in the presence of spanners. Maybe a combination of both, since it only happens when we inject a caption."

This suggests that when Quarto adds a caption to a GT table, it's either:
1. Not properly handling the HTML structure of GT tables with spanners
2. Applying CSS that conflicts with GT's spanner styling
3. Incorrectly modifying the table structure when injecting the caption

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
src/format/html/format-html-shared.ts
src/format/html/format-html.ts
src/core/html.ts
src/command/render/pandoc.ts
src/core/handlers/base.ts
```

These files are most likely to contain the code responsible for:
1. Processing HTML tables and adding captions
2. Handling GT table output specifically
3. Managing HTML transformations and styling
4. Processing table elements during rendering
5. Handling base table formatting and caption injection

The issue is likely in how these files interact with GT table output, particularly when both spanners and captions are present.
