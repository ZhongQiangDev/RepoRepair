I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with code annotations in C/C++ and VHDL.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue is that code annotations for C/C++ and VHDL aren't being properly rendered. When users add annotations like `-- <1>` in VHDL or `// <1>` in C/C++, the system detects these annotations but doesn't replace them with the expected circle numbering. However, the same annotation system works correctly for R and Python code.

From the screenshots, we can see that:
1. In R and Python code blocks, the annotations are properly rendered as circled numbers
2. In C/C++ and VHDL code blocks, the annotations remain as comments with `<1>`, `<2>`, etc.

This suggests there's an issue with how the code annotation processor handles different programming languages.

## Files Most Likely Needing Edits

Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix the issue:

```
src/format/html/format-html.ts
src/core/handlers/base.ts
src/command/render/codetools.ts
src/core/lib/partition-cell-options.ts
src/core/handlers/types.ts
```

The issue is most likely in the code annotation processing logic in `format-html.ts` or `codetools.ts`, which probably doesn't properly handle the comment syntax for C/C++ and VHDL. The `partition-cell-options.ts` file contains functions for handling language-specific comments, and `base.ts` contains core handlers for processing code blocks. The `types.ts` file defines interfaces that might need to be updated to support these languages properly.
