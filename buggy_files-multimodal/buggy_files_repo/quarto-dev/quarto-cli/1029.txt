I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves a clash between the `aside` class and `r-stretch` in Reveal.js presentations. When a slide contains both:
1. A single figure (which gets the `r-stretch` class automatically)
2. An `aside` block

The problem is that:
- The figure is stretched too much
- The `aside` content overlaps with the bottom of the figure
- If the figure has a caption, the caption appears below the `aside` content

The desired behavior is that `aside` contents should have priority and always take the bottom part of the slide, while the figure should only stretch to the top of the `aside` block.

## Cause of the Issue

The issue is likely caused by how Reveal.js handles the automatic stretching of single figures on a slide and how it positions `aside` elements. The `r-stretch` class is making the figure take up all available vertical space without respecting the space needed by the `aside` element.

## Files That Need to Be Modified

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix this issue:

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins/support/support.js
src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/highlight/plugin.js
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-plugin.ts
src/resources/formats/revealjs/plugins/line-highlight/line-highlight.js
```

The most important file is likely `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts` as it contains the `applyStretch` function that handles stretching images in slides. This would need to be modified to respect the presence of `aside` elements.

The `support.js` file contains initialization logic for Reveal.js presentations and would be involved in handling layout elements like asides.

The other files are related to Reveal.js plugins and might need adjustments to ensure proper interaction between stretched elements and asides.
