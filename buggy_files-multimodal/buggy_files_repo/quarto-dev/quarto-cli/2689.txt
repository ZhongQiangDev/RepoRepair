I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The GitHub problem description shows an image where cross-references are being displayed in a document when they shouldn't be. The issue is that there needs to be support for `crossref: false` in formats to disable cross-referencing functionality.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The problem appears to be that when a user specifies `crossref: false` in their format configuration, the system is still processing and displaying cross-references. This suggests that the code isn't properly checking for or respecting this configuration option.

Based on the repository information, this likely involves the cross-reference filtering and activation logic in the rendering pipeline. The system needs to check if cross-referencing has been explicitly disabled before applying cross-reference processing.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

After analyzing the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited to fix the issue:

```
src/command/render/crossref.ts
src/command/render/render-contexts.ts
src/command/render/pandoc.ts
src/command/render/render-files.ts
src/config/format.ts
```

The most important file is `src/command/render/crossref.ts` as it contains the `crossrefFilterActive` function which determines whether cross-referencing should be active. This function needs to be modified to properly respect the `crossref: false` setting in formats.
