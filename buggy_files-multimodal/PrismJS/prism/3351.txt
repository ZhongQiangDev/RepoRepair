I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with "UUID" being incorrectly highlighted in Java code.

## Problem Analysis

The issue is that in Java code highlighting, the class name "UUID" is being rendered as plain text instead of being properly highlighted as a class name token. According to the screenshot and description, when importing Java classes like:

`java
import java.util.UUID;
`

"UUID" should be highlighted as a class name (like other imported classes), but it's currently being rendered as plain text.

## Cause Analysis

This is likely an issue with the Java language definition in Prism.js. The Java syntax highlighting rules probably don't correctly identify "UUID" as a class name. This could be due to:

1. An incomplete pattern for matching class names in Java imports
2. A specific issue with how "UUID" is being processed compared to other class names
3. A regex pattern that doesn't properly capture all valid Java class names

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information, the most relevant files for fixing this issue would be:

```
components/prism-java.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-clike.js
components/prism-markup.js
plugins/autoloader/prism-autoloader.js
```

The `prism-java.js` file is the most important as it contains the Java-specific syntax highlighting rules. This is where the class name pattern for Java would be defined, and it's the most likely place where the fix would need to be implemented to properly highlight "UUID" as a class name.
