I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that in shell session code highlighting, the `#` character is being incorrectly identified as a "shell-symbol" token, leading to incorrect highlighting. In the screenshot, we can see that the `#` in a URL (specifically in "https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changes.html#pre-1-0-9-manifest-spoofing-vulnerability") is highlighted as if it were a shell prompt symbol, which is incorrect.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is likely in the shell session language definition in Prism.js. The shell session highlighter is incorrectly identifying the `#` character within URLs as a shell prompt symbol (like `$` or `#`). The pattern used to match shell symbols is probably too broad and doesn't properly exclude `#` characters that appear in contexts like URLs.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
components/prism-shell-session.js
components/prism-bash.js
prism.js
```

The `components/prism-shell-session.js` file is most important because it contains the specific language definition for shell sessions, including the patterns for identifying shell symbols like `$` and `#`. This is where the incorrect pattern that's causing the issue would be located.

The `components/prism-bash.js` file is relevant as a secondary file because shell sessions often use bash syntax highlighting for the commands, and there might be interactions between these two language definitions.

The `prism.js` file is included as it's the core file that processes all language definitions and applies the highlighting, though the specific issue is more likely in the shell-session component.
