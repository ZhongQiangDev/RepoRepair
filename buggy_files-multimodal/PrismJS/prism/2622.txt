I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to add support for Apex language in Prism.js.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The issue is that there's no support for Apex language in Prism.js. Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language used in Salesforce development. The user is asking whether it's worth adding a new language definition for Apex, given that it's syntactically similar to Java.

## Analyzing the Cause
The user suggests that Apex could be implemented as an alias of the Java language definition, since they're syntactically similar. They propose a simple solution:

`javascript
// prism-apex.js
;(function (Prism) {
  Prism.languages.apex = Prism.languages.java
})(Prism)
`

This would create a new language definition for Apex that inherits all rules from Java. The user is wondering if this approach is appropriate or if a more comprehensive solution is needed.

## Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the files that would need to be edited to add support for Apex:

`
components/prism-java.js
components/index.js
prism.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/show-language/prism-show-language.js
`

The most important file is `components/prism-java.js` since Apex is syntactically similar to Java and would inherit its syntax highlighting rules. The `components/index.js` file would need to be updated to include Apex in the list of available languages. The `prism.js` file is the core file that might need adjustments to recognize the new language. The `components/prism-core.js` contains the core functionality for language definitions. Finally, `plugins/show-language/prism-show-language.js` would need to be updated to display "Apex" instead of "Java" when showing the language name in the toolbar.
