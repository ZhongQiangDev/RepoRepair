I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior

The problem is related to CSS syntax highlighting in Prism.js. Specifically, when a CSS value is specified together with the `!important` statement, the `important` flag is not being recognized as a token with the type `important`. This means it's not getting the proper syntax highlighting.

From the screenshot, we can see that `!important` is not being highlighted differently from the rest of the value.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause

The issue is likely in how Prism.js tokenizes CSS code. The CSS language definition in Prism.js needs to properly recognize the `!important` statement when it appears immediately after a CSS value without any whitespace.

The tokenizer is probably not correctly identifying `!important` as a separate token when it's directly adjacent to a value. This would be in the CSS language definition part of Prism.js.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, these are the most relevant files that would need to be edited:

```
prism.js
components/prism-css.js
```

I've listed only two files because:

1. `prism.js` is the main file that contains the CSS syntax highlighting IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) as mentioned in the repository information. This file likely contains the core CSS language definition.

2. There might be a separate `components/prism-css.js` file (though it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the repository information) that would contain the specific CSS language definition. This is a common pattern in Prism.js where language definitions are separated into component files.

The issue is specifically with CSS token recognition, so these would be the primary files to check and modify to fix the problem with the `!important` token recognition.
