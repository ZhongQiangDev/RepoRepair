I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue with Swift syntax highlighting.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that certain Swift keywords are not being properly highlighted in the syntax highlighter. Specifically, the `isolated` keyword (shown in the image) is not being highlighted as a keyword when it appears in front of function body parameter types.

## Analyzing the Cause
The cause is likely that the Swift language definition in Prism.js is missing some keywords in its pattern matching rules, particularly keywords that can appear in specific contexts like function parameter types. The `isolated` keyword is a relatively newer addition to Swift (introduced with Swift concurrency features) and needs to be added to the keyword list or pattern in the Swift language definition.

## Files That Need to Be Edited
The most important file would be the Swift language definition file. Based on the repository information provided, the Swift language definition file isn't explicitly listed, but it would follow the naming pattern of other language files:

```
components/prism-swift.js
```

This is the only file that would need to be modified to fix this issue. The fix would involve adding the `isolated` keyword to the appropriate pattern in the Swift language definition.
