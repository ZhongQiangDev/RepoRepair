I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that Prism.js currently doesn't support G-code syntax highlighting. The user is requesting to add "G-code" syntax highlighting with the language identifier of `gcode`.

## 2. Analyzing the Cause
The cause is simply that G-code language support hasn't been added to Prism.js yet. The user has provided a very simple implementation that already exists in another repository (https://github.com/kmoser77/prismjs-reprap-gcode). This implementation defines basic syntax highlighting for G-code commands, properties, and comments.

## 3. Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the repository information, these are the files that would need to be edited to add G-code support:

```
components/prism-core.js
components/index.js
```

The implementation would require:
1. Creating a new file `components/prism-gcode.js` with the provided implementation
2. Updating the language index to include the new language

The core file might need to be checked to ensure proper integration, but the main work would be creating the new language definition file and ensuring it's properly registered in the index.
