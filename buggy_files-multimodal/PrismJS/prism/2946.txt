I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The issue involves reST (reStructuredText) syntax highlighting in Prism.js. Specifically:

1. When a link element and verbatim elements are on the same line, they are not properly detected and the entire text is rendered as italic.
2. When split into two lines, the elements render correctly.

The problem occurs with this syntax:
`rst
`ALTER ROLE <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-alterrole.html>`_ or ``ALTER_ROLE``
`

This suggests an issue with the reST language definition in Prism.js, specifically with how it handles links and verbatim text when they appear on the same line.

## Cause of the Issue

The problem is likely in the regular expressions or tokenization rules for reST links and verbatim text. When these elements appear on the same line, the pattern matching is failing to correctly identify both elements, causing the entire line to be incorrectly tokenized as a single element (appearing as italic).

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Based on the repository information, the most relevant files would be those related to reST language definition in Prism.js:

```
components/prism-rest.js
components/prism-core.js
prism.js
```

The primary file to edit would be `components/prism-rest.js` which would contain the language definition for reStructuredText, including the patterns for links and verbatim text. This is where the fix would need to be implemented.

The other files are included as they might be involved in the core tokenization process, but the main issue is almost certainly in the reST-specific language definition.
