Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The formatter in ESLint doesn't support async operations
- Specifically, when trying to use shiki (an async syntax highlighter) in a formatter, it fails because ESLint's formatter API is synchronous only

2. Cause Analysis:
- ESLint's formatter API is designed to be synchronous, expecting formatters to return strings immediately
- The core issue is in the formatter interface definition and handling in ESLint's CLI engine
- This prevents using modern async tools like shiki for syntax highlighting in formatters

3. Most Related Files:
```
lib/cli-engine/cli-engine.js
lib/cli.js
lib/eslint/eslint.js
lib/source-code/source-code.js
lib/cli-engine/formatters/html.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- cli-engine.js contains the core formatter loading and execution logic
- cli.js handles the main CLI operations including formatter output
- eslint.js contains the main ESLint class that processes and formats results
- source-code.js handles source code processing which formatters need to access
- html.js is an example built-in formatter showing the current synchronous pattern

The fix would need to modify these files to support async formatter operations, particularly in the CLI engine and formatter interface.
