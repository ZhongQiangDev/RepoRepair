Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The `no-constant-condition` rule is reporting error ranges that are too broad. Instead of just highlighting the constant condition (e.g., "true"), it's highlighting the entire statement or expression containing the constant condition.

2. Cause Analysis:
The issue appears to be in how the rule reports error locations. When reporting violations, it's using the entire node's range (IfStatement or ConditionalExpression) rather than specifically targeting the constant condition's range. This results in overly broad error highlighting in editors and IDEs.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling this issue:

```
lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js
lib/report-translator.js
lib/linter.js
lib/cli-engine.js
lib/source-code-util.js
```

The `no-constant-condition.js` is the primary rule implementation file that needs modification. The `report-translator.js` handles error reporting and location information. The `linter.js` contains core linting logic and rule application. The `cli-engine.js` orchestrates the linting process. The `source-code-util.js` provides utilities for source code analysis and location handling.

The fix would primarily involve modifying the error reporting in `no-constant-condition.js` to use the specific range of the constant condition rather than the entire statement's range.
