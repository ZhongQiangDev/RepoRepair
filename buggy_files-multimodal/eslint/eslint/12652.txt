Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves incorrect formatting of object properties when using the `key-spacing` rule with `align: 'value'` option in JSX objects. The rule is causing undesired alignment of values in JSX style objects, making the code less readable.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be that the `key-spacing` rule's alignment logic is being applied too aggressively to JSX style objects. The rule is trying to align values across multiple lines even when it would make more sense to keep the original formatting, especially in JSX contexts where style objects have their own conventional formatting patterns.

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files that would need to be modified to fix this issue:

```
lib/rules/key-spacing.js
lib/rules/object-curly-spacing.js
lib/rules/object-property-newline.js
```

The `key-spacing.js` file is the primary file that needs modification as it contains the core logic for handling key spacing and alignment. The `object-curly-spacing.js` and `object-property-newline.js` files are also relevant as they work in conjunction with key-spacing rules to determine overall object formatting, especially in JSX contexts.
