Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
The issue involves incorrect indentation in JSX code when using parentheses around binary expressions. Specifically, when using `&&` with parentheses in JSX, the indentation is incorrectly flagged as an error in ESLint 4.1.0, while it worked fine in 4.0.

2. Cause Analysis:
The root cause appears to be a regression in how indentation is calculated for JSX expressions containing binary expressions with parentheses. The indentation rule is not properly handling the combination of:
- JSX syntax
- Binary expressions (like `&&`)
- Parentheses around those expressions
- Nested indentation levels

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these are the most relevant files for fixing this indentation issue:

```
lib/rules/indent.js
lib/rules/indent-legacy.js
lib/rules/jsx-quotes.js
lib/rules/no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs.js
lib/rules/space-before-blocks.js
```

The `indent.js` and `indent-legacy.js` files are most critical as they directly handle indentation rules and calculations. The JSX-specific handling would be primarily in these files. The other files are related to spacing and formatting rules that could interact with indentation in JSX contexts.
