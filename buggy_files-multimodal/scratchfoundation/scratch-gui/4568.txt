I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the slider monitor issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that in Scratch 3.0, slider monitors have a fixed range of 0-100, and users cannot change the min/max values by right-clicking the slider monitor. This functionality existed in Scratch 2.0 and is currently missing in 3.0, even though the custom range is being imported from 2.0 projects.

## Analyzing the Cause
The issue is likely in the monitor component that renders sliders. The code needs to be modified to:
1. Allow right-clicking on slider monitors to open a context menu
2. Add options to change min/max values in that context menu
3. Update the slider's range when these values are changed
4. Persist these changes to the project state

## Most Related Files
After analyzing the repository information, here are the most important files that would need to be edited:

```
src/components/monitor/monitor.jsx
src/containers/monitor.jsx
src/reducers/monitor-layout.js
src/lib/monitor-adapter.js
src/containers/monitor-list.jsx
```

The `monitor.jsx` files are the most critical as they handle the rendering and interaction with monitors, including the slider type. The `monitor.jsx` component likely needs to be updated to handle right-click events and display a context menu with min/max options.

The `monitor-layout.js` reducer would need modifications to store and update the min/max values in the state.

The `monitor-adapter.js` file is important for processing monitor data before rendering, and would need to handle the custom min/max values.

Finally, `monitor-list.jsx` may need updates to ensure the modified monitors are properly rendered with their custom ranges.
