I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Analysis of the Problem

The GitHub problem description indicates that the repository needs to update the `autoprefixer` dependency from version 8.6.5 to version 9.0.0. This is a major version update that includes breaking changes, such as:

1. Dropping Node.js 4 and Node.js 9 support
2. Removing IE and "dead" browsers from Babel's targets
3. Using Browserslist 4.0 for target browser specifications
4. Using PostCSS 7.0

## Cause of the Issue

The repository is using an outdated version of autoprefixer (8.6.5) as a devDependency. The update to version 9.0.0 involves breaking changes, particularly around browser targeting and PostCSS compatibility.

## Files That Need to Be Edited

Looking at the repository information, the most relevant files would be those that:
1. Define the dependency version
2. Configure autoprefixer
3. Use PostCSS plugins

```
webpack.config.js
package.json
```

The `webpack.config.js` file is the most important as it contains the configuration for PostCSS plugins, including autoprefixer. This file shows that autoprefixer is being used as part of a function that returns an array of PostCSS plugins.

The `package.json` file (though not explicitly shown in the repository information) would need to be updated to change the version specification for the autoprefixer dependency.

These are the only files that would need to be modified to update the autoprefixer version. The webpack.config.js might need adjustments to accommodate any breaking changes in the autoprefixer API, while package.json would need the version number updated.
