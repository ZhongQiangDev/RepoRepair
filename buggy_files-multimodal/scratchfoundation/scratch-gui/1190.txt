I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The GitHub problem description is about updating the `scratch-vm` dependency from version `0.1.0-prerelease.1513627112-prerelease.1513627124` to version `0.1.0-prerelease.1513710334-prerelease.1513710351`. This is a dependency update PR created by Greenkeeper.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
The key changes in the new version of scratch-vm include:
- Adding a separator to extension block definition
- Updating webpack to version 3.10.0

Additionally, there's a comment about implementing "run without screen refresh" in custom procedures modal, which depends on a scratch-blocks issue (#1277).

## 3. Files most related to the cause
Based on the repository information provided, the files that would need to be edited to fix this issue are:

```
package.json
package-lock.json
src/components/custom-procedures/custom-procedures.jsx
src/containers/custom-procedures.jsx
webpack.config.js
```

The reasoning for these files:

1. `package.json` - This file needs to be updated to reference the new version of scratch-vm.
2. `package-lock.json` - This file will need to be updated to reflect the dependency changes.
3. `src/components/custom-procedures/custom-procedures.jsx` - This file is directly mentioned in the PR description regarding implementing "run without screen refresh" in the custom procedures modal.
4. `src/containers/custom-procedures.jsx` - This is the container component for custom procedures that would need to be updated to support the new functionality.
5. `webpack.config.js` - Since one of the changes in the new scratch-vm version is updating webpack to 3.10.0, this configuration file might need adjustments to work with the new webpack version.
