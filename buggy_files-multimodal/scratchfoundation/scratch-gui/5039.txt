I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Identifying the Wrong Behavior
The problem is that when a user right-clicks on a sprite after dragging it to another space, the duplicate menu (context menu) does not appear. Instead, the OS's default context menu appears. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior where the duplicate menu should appear when right-clicking a sprite.

## Analyzing the Cause
Based on the GIF and description, this appears to be an issue with the context menu handling in the sprite selector component. The problem likely occurs because:

1. After dragging a sprite, the event handling for right-clicks is not properly intercepted
2. The application is failing to prevent the default browser context menu
3. The custom context menu trigger is not being properly activated after a drag operation

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/components/sprite-selector-item/sprite-selector-item.jsx
src/components/context-menu/context-menu.jsx
src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx
src/lib/drag-recognizer.js
src/components/sprite-selector/sprite-list.jsx
```

The `sprite-selector-item.jsx` files are most critical as they handle the sprite item rendering and interactions, including right-click events. The `context-menu.jsx` file manages the custom context menu that should appear instead of the OS menu. The `drag-recognizer.js` likely contains logic that might be interfering with right-click detection after drag operations. Finally, the `sprite-list.jsx` file coordinates the overall sprite list behavior and might need adjustments to properly handle post-drag context menu interactions.
