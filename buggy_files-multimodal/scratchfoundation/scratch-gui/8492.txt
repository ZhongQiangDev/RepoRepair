I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue described is that when using the sound recording modal, if a user drags the sound selection handles and the mouse goes outside the modal, the modal closes unexpectedly, causing the user to lose their work.

This is a classic issue with modals and mouse events. When a user starts dragging inside a modal but then moves the mouse outside the modal's boundaries, the modal is incorrectly interpreting this as a click outside the modal (which typically closes modals). However, since the user is in the middle of a drag operation, the modal should remain open until the drag operation is completed.

The problem description mentions that updating react-modal might solve this issue, referencing a similar fix in another repository. This suggests that the issue is related to how the modal component handles mouse events, particularly during drag operations.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/components/modal/modal.jsx
src/components/audio-trimmer/audio-selector.jsx
src/components/record-modal/record-modal.jsx
src/containers/audio-selector.jsx
src/lib/drag-recognizer.js
```

### Reasoning:

1. **src/components/modal/modal.jsx**: This is the core modal component that likely handles the closing behavior when clicking outside. It's probably using react-modal under the hood and needs to be updated to prevent closing during drag operations.

2. **src/components/audio-trimmer/audio-selector.jsx**: This component handles the selection handles that the user is dragging when the issue occurs. It's directly involved in the drag operation that's being interrupted.

3. **src/components/record-modal/record-modal.jsx**: This is the specific modal implementation for sound recording that's experiencing the issue. It likely needs to be updated to use an improved modal configuration.

4. **src/containers/audio-selector.jsx**: This container component manages the state and behavior of the audio selection, including the drag operations. It might need modifications to properly handle mouse events that go outside the modal.

5. **src/lib/drag-recognizer.js**: This utility handles drag recognition and might need adjustments to properly communicate with the modal to prevent it from closing during active drag operations.
