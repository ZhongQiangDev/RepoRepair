I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files most related to implementing a navigation bar in the GUI.

## 1. Identifying the wrong behavior
The problem description states that a navigation bar needs to be designed and integrated into the GUI, even if most features are marked as "Coming Soon". This suggests that currently there is no navigation bar in the GUI, which is the wrong behavior.

## 2. Analyzing the cause
The cause is simply that the navigation bar component hasn't been fully implemented yet. Based on the repository information, there appears to be some navigation-related components (like MenuBar), but they need to be properly integrated into the GUI to create a complete navigation experience.

## 3. Files most related to the cause

```
src/components/menu-bar/menu-bar.jsx
src/components/gui/gui.jsx
src/components/language-selector/language-selector.jsx
src/components/box/box.jsx
src/components/button/button.jsx
```

The `menu-bar.jsx` is most important as it appears to be the main component for the navigation bar. The `gui.jsx` file is where this menu bar would need to be integrated into the overall GUI. The `language-selector.jsx` is a component that would likely be part of the navigation bar. The `box.jsx` and `button.jsx` files provide the basic UI components needed for building the navigation elements.
