I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the files that need to be edited to fix the issue.

## Problem Analysis

The issue described is that on iPads, when clicking the add sprite/costume/backdrop button, the library is loaded with the search bar focused, which automatically triggers the iPad's keyboard to appear. This is problematic because:

1. The keyboard takes up half the screen on iPads
2. This leaves very little space to see the actual sprites/costumes/backdrops
3. The automatic keyboard popup creates a poor user experience on touch devices

The root cause appears to be that the search input field in the library component is automatically focused when the library opens, which is triggering the on-screen keyboard on iPads.

## Files Most Related to the Cause

Looking at the repository information, I need to identify which files handle the library component, particularly focusing on how the search input is managed when the library opens.

```
src/components/library-item/library-item.jsx
src/components/library/library.jsx
src/containers/sprite-library.jsx
src/containers/costume-library.jsx
src/containers/backdrop-library.jsx
```

Note: I don't see `src/components/library/library.jsx` in the provided repository information, but based on the component naming patterns and the issue description, this would likely be the main component that needs modification. The search bar focus behavior would most likely be in this component. The other files I've listed are the most relevant from the available information, as they handle the different types of libraries mentioned in the issue (sprite, costume, and backdrop).
