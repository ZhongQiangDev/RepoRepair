Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- Flexbox elements in react-pdf don't stretch to fill the full page size
- The layout shows uneven spacing and elements not expanding properly compared to the equivalent HTML/CSS implementation

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with how flexbox layout calculations are handled in react-pdf's layout engine
- The problem likely stems from how flex properties and container dimensions are processed and applied during layout calculation
- The core issue seems to be in the layout engine's handling of flex-grow and container sizing

3. Most Related Files:
The most relevant files for this flexbox layout issue would be:

```
packages/layout/src/node/setFlexDirection.js
packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js
packages/layout/src/node/setDisplay.js
packages/layout/src/node/getDimension.js
packages/stylesheet/src/expand/flex.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. setFlexDirection.js handles the core flexbox direction property which is fundamental to layout behavior
2. resolveDimensions.js manages the overall dimension calculations and layout resolution
3. setDisplay.js controls how flex containers are displayed and initialized
4. getDimension.js retrieves computed dimensions which affects how elements stretch
5. flex.js handles the parsing and expansion of flex properties that determine how elements grow and shrink

These files together form the core of how flexbox layout is implemented and calculated in react-pdf, and would need to be modified to fix the stretching behavior.
