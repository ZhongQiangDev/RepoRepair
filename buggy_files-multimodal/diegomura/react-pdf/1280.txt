Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The flexBasis property is not working after upgrading from v1.6.14 to v2.0.8
- The layout is not respecting the specified percentage values (50%, 25%, 25%) for text elements in a flex container

2. Cause Analysis:
- This appears to be an issue with how percentage-based flexBasis values are being processed in the layout engine
- The problem likely stems from either:
  a) The flex basis calculation logic not properly handling percentage values
  b) The style resolution system not correctly transforming percentage values into absolute values
  c) The Yoga layout engine integration not properly applying flexBasis values

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in handling flex basis calculations and style processing:

```
packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `setYogaValue.js` handles setting Yoga node properties including flex basis
- `expand.js` processes and expands style properties including flex-related ones
- `resolveDimensions.js` handles dimension calculations and layout resolution

The issue is likely centered in `setYogaValue.js` where percentage-based flex basis values should be properly processed and applied to the Yoga layout engine.
