Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The type definition for Image source object in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` doesn't support a function that returns a Promise<string>, despite the documentation stating this is supported.
- This causes TypeScript compilation errors when trying to use async functions as image sources.

2. Cause Analysis:
- The type definition in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` is incomplete, missing the function type `() => Promise<string>` in the `SourceObject` union type.
- The documentation states that image sources can be functions returning strings or promised strings, but the type definition only supports direct strings, buffer objects, and HTTP request objects.
- This mismatch between documentation and type definitions causes TypeScript to reject valid usage patterns.

3. Most Related Files:
```
packages/types/image.d.ts
packages/image/src/resolve.js
packages/image/src/cache.js
packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js
packages/layout/src/image/getSource.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
1. `packages/types/image.d.ts` contains the actual type definitions that need to be updated
2. `packages/image/src/resolve.js` handles image source resolution including functions and promises
3. `packages/image/src/cache.js` manages image caching which interacts with source resolution
4. `packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js` handles fetching images from various sources including functions
5. `packages/layout/src/image/getSource.js` extracts and normalizes image sources

The fix would primarily involve updating the SourceObject type in `image.d.ts` to include the function type that returns a Promise<string>.
