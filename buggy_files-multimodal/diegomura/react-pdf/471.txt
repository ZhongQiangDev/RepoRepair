Let me analyze this step by step:

1. Wrong Behavior:
- The styled components extension/inheritance is not working as expected
- All text elements render with the same style instead of having different colors and border styles
- ExampleText2 and ExampleText3 should inherit and override styles from their parent components but don't

2. Cause Analysis:
- The issue appears to be with how styled components inheritance is implemented in @react-pdf/styled-components
- Looking at the rendered PDF and console output, the style inheritance chain is broken
- The style resolution system is not properly merging or cascading styles from parent styled components
- This suggests an issue in either the style processing or the component inheritance mechanism

3. Most Related Files:
Based on the repository information, these files are most likely involved in the styled components implementation and style processing:

```
src/stylesheet/index.js
src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js
src/utils/styles.js
src/elements/Text.js
src/elements/Base.js
```

These files are ordered by importance because:
- stylesheet/index.js handles the core style processing and resolution
- transformStyles.js manages style transformations and inheritance
- styles.js contains utilities for style merging/flattening
- Text.js implements the text component that needs to handle the styles
- Base.js provides foundational styling capabilities that all components inherit

The issue likely stems from how styles are being processed and merged during the styled component inheritance chain, particularly in the stylesheet processing system.
