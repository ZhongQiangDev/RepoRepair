I'll analyze the GitHub problem description following the requested format.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Deprecation warning appears when rendering PDF: "Buffer() is deprecated due to security and usability issues"
**Cause**: The code is using the legacy `Buffer()` constructor which has been deprecated in Node.js since version 10. This constructor has known security and usability issues, particularly with handling user input that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Future compatibility risk with newer Node.js versions
**Cause**: The code relies on the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor which will be removed in future Node.js versions. This means the PDF rendering functionality will break completely when using newer Node.js versions that remove this constructor.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential security vulnerabilities in PDF rendering
**Cause**: The use of `Buffer()` constructor can lead to security issues because it doesn't properly initialize memory, potentially exposing sensitive data that was previously stored in the allocated memory space. This is one of the main reasons why Node.js deprecated this constructor.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the use of deprecated `Buffer()` constructor in the PDF rendering process, likely within the @react-pdf/renderer (version 1.5.4) or @react-pdf/styled-components (version 1.4.0) dependencies. This causes three main problems:
1. Deprecation warnings in current Node.js versions
2. Risk of future breakage when the constructor is removed
3. Potential security vulnerabilities

The solution would involve updating the code to use the newer Buffer methods (Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from()) as recommended in the deprecation warning. This would likely require either updating the react-pdf dependencies to newer versions that have fixed this issue or submitting a pull request to fix the underlying code.
