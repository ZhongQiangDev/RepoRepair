Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TypeError occurs when using the "flex" CSS property with a single value (flex: 1)
**Cause**: The code is likely trying to use String.split() method on a number value (1) instead of a string, indicating that the CSS parser in react-pdf v2.0.13 is not properly handling single-value flex properties.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Flexbox functionality is broken in react-pdf v2.0.13
**Cause**: The CSS parser appears to be expecting flex property values in a specific string format (possibly space-separated values like "1 1 auto"), but fails to handle shorthand single-value notation which is valid CSS.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Regression in CSS handling from previous versions
**Cause**: The update to version 2.0.13 likely introduced changes in how CSS properties are parsed or processed, breaking previously working flex implementations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from react-pdf v2.0.13's CSS parser mishandling the flex property shorthand notation. When users try to use the common "flex: 1" syntax, the parser attempts to split the numeric value as if it were a string, resulting in a TypeError. This appears to be a regression bug introduced in version 2.0.13 that affects the fundamental flexbox functionality. The parser needs to be updated to properly handle both single-value and multi-value flex property declarations according to CSS specifications.
