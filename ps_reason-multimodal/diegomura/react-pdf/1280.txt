Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The flexBasis property is not being applied correctly in version 2.0.8, causing the text elements to not occupy their specified percentage widths (50%, 25%, 25%)
**Cause**: This appears to be a regression issue in version 2.0.8 where the flexBasis percentage values are not being properly interpreted or applied to Text components within the flex container

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text elements are compressed/collapsed instead of maintaining their proportional spacing
**Cause**: The Text components may be defaulting to their intrinsic content width rather than respecting the flexBasis percentages, suggesting a possible change in how flex properties are inherited or applied to Text components specifically in v2.0.8

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of proper flex layout distribution compared to v1.6.14
**Cause**: The upgrade from v1.6.14 to v2.0.8 likely introduced changes in the flex layout engine or how style properties are processed, particularly affecting how percentage-based flexBasis values are handled

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from a regression in version 2.0.8 that affects how flexBasis percentage values are processed and applied to Text components within a flex container. The problem manifests in three ways: incorrect application of flexBasis properties, compression of text elements, and overall loss of proper flex layout distribution. This appears to be a breaking change between versions 1.6.14 and 2.0.8, specifically impacting how flex layout properties interact with Text components.
