Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The flexbox elements in React-PDF are not stretching to fill the full page width, leaving unwanted white space on the sides.
**Cause**: React-PDF's flexbox implementation appears to be handling the flex container's width calculation differently from standard browser behavior. The flex container is not automatically expanding to fill its parent container's width as it would in a regular browser environment.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout in React-PDF differs from the equivalent HTML/CSS implementation shown in the CodeSandbox example.
**Cause**: React-PDF uses a custom implementation of CSS layout rules through yoga-layout, which may not perfectly mirror browser implementations of flexbox. This can lead to inconsistencies between browser rendering and PDF rendering of seemingly identical flex layouts.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Content appears to be constrained to a narrower width than the available space.
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect width specifications in the parent containers. In React-PDF, containers might need explicit width declarations or specific flex properties to achieve full-width behavior, unlike browsers which handle this automatically in many cases.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from differences between React-PDF's layout engine and standard browser rendering. The main problems are related to:
1. Inconsistent flexbox width calculations
2. Different default behavior between React-PDF and browser implementations
3. Possible missing explicit width declarations needed specifically for React-PDF

To fix these issues, the solution would likely involve adding explicit width specifications and adjusting flex properties to force the desired full-width behavior in React-PDF's context.
