Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Margin auto alignment is not working correctly in v2 compared to v1, causing elements to be misaligned
**Cause**: Based on the diff image, there appears to be a regression in how margin: auto is handled in the layout engine between v1 and v2 versions of react-pdf. The right side (v2) shows elements not being centered properly while the left side (v1) shows correct centering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Layout inconsistency between v1 and v2 versions
**Cause**: The example code at knobs/index.js line 20 suggests there may be changes in how the layout system processes auto margins in the newer version, possibly due to:
- Changes in the underlying layout algorithm
- Different interpretation of CSS-like margin:auto property
- Potential regression in flexbox-like layout calculations

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual regression in component positioning
**Cause**: The snapshot test differences indicate that the automatic margin calculations that previously worked for centering elements in v1 are not being applied or calculated correctly in v2, suggesting a possible breaking change in the layout engine's margin handling logic.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a regression in how margin:auto is handled in react-pdf v2.0.0 compared to v1. The problem manifests as incorrect centering and positioning of elements, likely due to changes in the layout engine's handling of automatic margins. This affects the visual presentation of documents created with react-pdf v2, causing elements that should be centered to appear misaligned. The issue seems to be specifically related to the layout calculation system and how it processes margin:auto declarations, rather than being a platform-specific or environment-related problem.
