Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: On iPads, when opening the sprite/costume/backdrop library, the keyboard automatically pops up
**Cause**: The search bar in the library is automatically focused when the library opens, triggering the iOS keyboard to appear. This is likely due to the default behavior of input fields getting focus on component mount/render.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor visibility of sprites/library content on iPad
**Cause**: The iOS keyboard takes up approximately half of the screen space, leaving limited viewing area for the actual library content. This is compounded by the iPad's already limited screen size compared to desktop.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from poor UX optimization for iPad users, where automatic keyboard triggering creates two problems:
1. Unwanted keyboard popup that disrupts the user experience
2. Reduced usable screen space for viewing library content

The root cause appears to be the automatic focus behavior of the search input field. This should likely be modified to only show the keyboard when the user explicitly taps the search field, rather than on library open. This would improve the user experience on iPad devices by:
- Maintaining full screen visibility of library content by default
- Giving users control over when they want to use the search functionality
- Preventing unexpected UI behavior

The issue seems to be primarily a UX/UI problem rather than a functional bug, but it significantly impacts the usability of the application on iPad devices.
