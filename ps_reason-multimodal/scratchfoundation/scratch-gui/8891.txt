Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The active/inactive states of setting switches are only distinguished by color (colored vs. grayscale)
**Cause**: The current design relies solely on color-filling to indicate the selected state, making it difficult or impossible for colorblind users to distinguish between active and inactive states when viewed in grayscale

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor contrast between active and inactive states
**Cause**: Using gray for inactive states and colored-in icons for active states doesn't provide sufficient visual distinction when converted to grayscale values, as both states appear similar in tone

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of alternative visual indicators for state changes
**Cause**: The design doesn't incorporate additional visual cues (like background changes, patterns, or shapes) that could help users identify the current state without relying on color perception

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from an accessibility problem where the setting switches' states are primarily distinguished through color differences. This creates three interconnected problems: color-dependent state indication, insufficient contrast, and absence of alternative visual indicators. These issues make it difficult for colorblind users to interact with the interface effectively. The proposed solution to use background color changes instead of icon coloring provides better visual distinction and accessibility, as it creates a clearer contrast between active and inactive states even when viewed in grayscale.
