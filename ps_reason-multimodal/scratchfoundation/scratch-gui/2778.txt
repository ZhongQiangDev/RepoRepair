Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Project is using an outdated version of autoprefixer (8.6.5) that doesn't include latest features and improvements
**Cause**: The current version range in the project's dependencies doesn't cover the new major version 9.0.0

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential compatibility issues with Node.js 4 and 9
**Cause**: Autoprefixer 9.0 has dropped support for Node.js 4 and 9 since these versions no longer receive security updates

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Possible issues with IE and "dead" browsers support
**Cause**: The new version has removed Internet Explorer and other browsers without security updates from Babel's targets

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential compatibility issues with RubyRacer and Sprockets 3 in Rails applications
**Cause**: Autoprefixer Rails 9.0 has dropped support for RubyRacer and Sprockets 3

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Possible outdated Can I Use DB warnings
**Cause**: Browserslist 4.0 (included in Autoprefixer 9.0) will now warn if Can I Use DB hasn't been updated in over 6 months

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around breaking changes in Autoprefixer 9.0, including dropped support for older Node.js versions, IE and dead browsers, and certain Rails components. The update brings significant changes through Browserslist 4.0 and PostCSS 7.0, requiring careful consideration of compatibility with existing project infrastructure. Projects need to ensure they meet the new minimum requirements and update their browser targeting configuration accordingly.
