Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Version mismatch between current and new scratch-vm dependency
**Cause**: The project is using an older version (0.1.0-prerelease.1513627112-prerelease.1513627124) while a newer version (0.1.0-prerelease.1513710334-prerelease.1513710351) is available but not covered by the current version range settings

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential compatibility issues with custom procedures modal
**Cause**: The implementation of "run without screen refresh" feature in custom procedures modal requires additional dependencies and may not work properly without the related scratch-blocks update (referenced in issue #1277)

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential build failures after update
**Cause**: The dependency update includes 4 new commits with changes to extension block definition and webpack updates, which could cause integration issues if the project's test coverage is not comprehensive

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around version management and compatibility. The core problem is the outdated scratch-vm dependency that needs updating, but this update brings changes to extension block definitions and webpack configurations. The implementation of new features like "run without screen refresh" in custom procedures depends on other components (scratch-blocks), making it a potentially complex update that requires careful testing and verification. The success of the update largely depends on the project's test coverage and build pipeline robustness.
