Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Modal unexpectedly closes when dragging mouse outside its boundaries
**Cause**: The modal component (react-modal) likely has a default behavior that closes it when clicking/dragging outside its boundaries. This is a common UX pattern for modals, but in this case it's interfering with the sound recording functionality that requires mouse dragging actions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: User loses unsaved work when modal closes
**Cause**: There appears to be no work preservation mechanism (like auto-save or confirmation dialog) when the modal unexpectedly closes. The sound recording state is likely being reset or cleared when the modal unmounts.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Sound selection handles interaction is interrupted
**Cause**: The modal's click-outside-to-close behavior is taking precedence over the sound selection handles' drag functionality, preventing users from completing their intended editing actions when the mouse moves beyond the modal boundaries.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from react-modal's default behavior conflicting with the sound editor's functionality. The modal closes when the mouse is dragged outside its boundaries, which interrupts the sound editing process and causes loss of work. This can be fixed by:
1. Updating react-modal to a version that better handles drag interactions
2. Implementing a work preservation mechanism
3. Modifying the modal's behavior to prevent closing during active drag operations

The reference to a similar fix in scratch-www (PR #2987) suggests this is a known issue with a potential solution through a react-modal update.
