Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Console warning appears when trying to use ref with ComboBox component
**Cause**: The ComboBox component was rewritten from a class component to a functional component, and functional components cannot directly accept refs. The component is not properly forwarding refs using React.forwardRef().

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to access ComboBox component via ref
**Cause**: The component implementation lacks ref forwarding functionality that would allow parent components to access the ComboBox's internal DOM node or methods. Unlike TextInput component which properly implements ref forwarding, ComboBox doesn't have this implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between TextInput and ComboBox components in terms of ref handling
**Cause**: While other Carbon components like TextInput properly implement ref forwarding (as shown in the referenced GitHub link), the ComboBox component wasn't updated to maintain this consistency when it was converted to a functional component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the ComboBox component's conversion from a class component to a functional component without properly implementing ref forwarding. This causes three related problems: console warnings, inability to access the component via refs, and inconsistency with other Carbon components. The solution would be to implement React.forwardRef() in the ComboBox component, similar to how it's implemented in the TextInput component. This would resolve the warning, enable ref functionality, and maintain consistency across the Carbon component library.

To fix this, the ComboBox component needs to be wrapped with React.forwardRef() and properly forward the ref to the underlying DOM element or component structure, similar to how it's implemented in the TextInput component that was referenced in the issue description.
