Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the issues and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing Progress Bar Component in Carbon Design System
**Cause**: The Carbon Design System currently only has a Progress Indicator component for showing steps in a wizard-like process, but lacks a dedicated Progress Bar component for showing percent-complete status of operations.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited Progress Status Information
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't have a standardized way to display important progress information like:
- Estimated time remaining
- Process speed
- Current operation details
This leads to inconsistent implementations across different teams.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent Visual Design
**Cause**: Without a standardized Progress Bar component in the design system, teams might implement their own versions with different:
- Color schemes
- Typography
- Spacing and layout
- Animation behaviors
This creates inconsistency across IBM products.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of Accessibility Considerations
**Cause**: Without a standardized component, individual implementations might not properly address accessibility requirements like:
- ARIA labels
- Color contrast ratios
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is the absence of a standardized Progress Bar component in the Carbon Design System. This leads to several problems:
1. Teams having to create custom implementations
2. Inconsistent user experiences across IBM products
3. Potential accessibility issues
4. Missing standardized way to display progress-related information

The solution requires developing a new Progress Bar component that:
- Follows Carbon Design System guidelines
- Supports all necessary progress information display
- Ensures accessibility compliance
- Provides consistent behavior and styling across implementations
