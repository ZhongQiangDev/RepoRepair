Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: SideNav remains expanded after clicking a SideNavLink
**Cause**: The SideNav component is not programmed to automatically collapse when a navigation link is clicked. This is because the `expanded` state is only controlled by the `onClickSideNavExpand` handler connected to the HeaderMenuButton, with no additional event handling for SideNavLink clicks.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Clicking on the overlay does not close the SideNav
**Cause**: There is no click event handler attached to the overlay area. The only way to collapse the SideNav is through the HeaderMenuButton's `onClickSideNavExpand` handler. The overlay is purely visual and lacks the expected interaction functionality.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Clicking on the menu bar area does not close the SideNav
**Cause**: Similar to the overlay issue, the Header component is not configured to handle click events that should collapse the SideNav. The `isSideNavExpanded` state is only toggled through the HeaderMenuButton component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from incomplete event handling in the UI Shell implementation. The SideNav's expanded state is currently only controlled by the HeaderMenuButton, while standard UX patterns expect the SideNav to collapse when:
1. Clicking a navigation link
2. Clicking the overlay
3. Clicking anywhere in the header/menu bar area

To fix these issues, additional click event handlers need to be implemented for the SideNav, overlay, and header areas, all of which should trigger the collapse behavior by setting `isSideNavExpanded` to false. This would align with common mobile navigation patterns and improve the overall user experience.
