Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple tooltips appearing simultaneously when one button has focus and another is hovered
**Cause**: The tooltip system is not handling the interaction states properly - it's showing tooltips for both focus and hover states independently without considering other active tooltips

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Tooltip overlap creating visual clutter and poor user experience
**Cause**: The buttons' close proximity (48px size) combined with the lack of tooltip management causes tooltips to occupy the same space without any positioning logic to prevent overlap

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potentially redundant accessibility implementation
**Cause**: The current implementation may be overcomplicating accessibility by showing tooltips on focus when aria-label could be sufficient for screen readers

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent tooltip behavior between focus and hover states
**Cause**: The tooltip system lacks a clear hierarchy or rules for when tooltips should be shown or hidden based on different interaction states (focus vs hover)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from poor tooltip management in the Carbon Components implementation. The system needs to:
1. Implement proper tooltip state management to ensure only one tooltip is visible at a time
2. Establish clear rules for tooltip behavior during different interaction states
3. Simplify accessibility implementation by potentially removing focus-triggered tooltips in favor of aria-labels
4. Add logic to handle tooltip positioning or visibility when multiple interactive elements are close together

The solution could either be to hide the focused tooltip when hovering another button or to remove the focus-triggered tooltip behavior entirely while maintaining accessibility through aria-labels.
