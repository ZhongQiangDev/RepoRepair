Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided screenshot, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The breadcrumb component has hyperlinks that are missing proper link text or alternative text.
**Cause**: The hyperlinks in the breadcrumb component have been implemented without providing either visible text content or appropriate aria-labels/alt text for screen readers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple DAP (Digital Accessibility Platform) violations are being reported for the same issue across different breadcrumb components.
**Cause**: This appears to be a systematic issue in the skeleton implementation where the basic accessibility requirements for hyperlinks are not being met in the component's base structure.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The accessibility checker (DAP IBM Accessibility) is flagging these as Level A violations.
**Cause**: The implementation doesn't comply with WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 2.4.4 (Link Purpose), which requires that the purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around accessibility violations in the breadcrumb component's hyperlinks. The component is failing to provide proper text or alternative text for its links, which is essential for screen readers and accessibility compliance. This appears to be a fundamental implementation issue in the skeleton component that needs to be addressed by either:
1. Adding visible text content to the links
2. Providing appropriate aria-labels for screen readers
3. Including alt text for any image-based links

These changes are necessary to meet WCAG accessibility standards and pass DAP validation checks.
