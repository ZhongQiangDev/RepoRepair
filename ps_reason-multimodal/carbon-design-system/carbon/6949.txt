Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from this pagination component issue.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination component displays "NaN-NaN of 200 items" when "All" is selected
**Cause**: The pagination component expects numeric values for calculations but receives a text value ("All") instead. When trying to perform mathematical operations with a non-numeric value, JavaScript returns NaN (Not a Number).

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination component doesn't support custom text labels for page size options
**Cause**: The current implementation only accepts an array of numbers for pageSizes prop (`pageSizes=[5, 10, 15, 25]`). There's no built-in way to map these numbers to custom display text, making it impossible to show labels like "All" while maintaining the actual numeric value.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to properly handle the "show all" functionality in the pagination
**Cause**: The component's architecture assumes each page size option will be a fixed number, without considering edge cases like showing all items. This limitation in the design prevents proper handling of dynamic total-items scenarios.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The page navigation becomes inconsistent when "All" is selected
**Cause**: Since the pagination calculations (like total pages, current page range) are based on the page size value, using a non-numeric or special value breaks these calculations, resulting in incorrect navigation behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from the pagination component's rigid design that only accepts numeric values for page sizes. This creates multiple problems when trying to implement an "All" option: display issues (NaN values), calculation errors in pagination logic, and lack of support for custom labels. The component needs to be redesigned to support both numeric values and special cases like "All" through a more flexible data structure that separates the display text from the actual values (like the suggested `pageSizeList` format). This would maintain proper pagination calculations while allowing for custom labels.
