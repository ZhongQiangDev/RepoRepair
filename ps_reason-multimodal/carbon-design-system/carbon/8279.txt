Based on the GitHub problem description and provided GIFs, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When using shift+click for multi-selection, the last selected tile becomes deselected even though it should remain selected according to the `selected` props.
**Cause**: The issue stems from the Tile component's click handler not properly respecting the `selected` props value. Instead of using the props value to determine the selection state, it's automatically toggling the state on click, which conflicts with the shift+click multi-selection logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent selection behavior between single click and shift+click operations
**Cause**: The code at the referenced location (Tile.js lines 239-247) is handling the click event without properly distinguishing between regular clicks and shift+clicks. The selection state management doesn't properly account for the shift key modifier in the click handler logic.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The selection state becomes out of sync with the parent component's intended state
**Cause**: There appears to be a state management issue where the local state in the Tile component is overriding the controlled state from the parent component through props. This violates the React principle of controlled components where the parent should be the source of truth for the selection state.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around improper state management in the SelectableTile component. The component is not properly respecting the `selected` props passed from the parent component, especially during shift+click operations. The click handler is implementing a toggle behavior that conflicts with the multi-selection logic, causing tiles to become deselected when they should remain selected. This creates an inconsistency between the component's internal state and the expected state based on the props. The fix would likely involve modifying the click handler to properly respect the `selected` props and implementing proper multi-selection logic that works in harmony with both single clicks and shift+clicks.
