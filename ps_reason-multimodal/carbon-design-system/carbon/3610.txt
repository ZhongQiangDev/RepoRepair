Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `light` prop is not being properly propagated to the underlying Listbox component, resulting in the `bx--list-box--light` CSS class not being applied when the `light` prop is set to `true`.

**Cause**: There appears to be a break in the prop chain between the parent dropdown component and the child Listbox component. The prop is likely not being passed down correctly in the component hierarchy.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The styling inconsistency in the UI where the light theme is not being applied to the Listbox despite being enabled through the knob control.

**Cause**: The component's implementation is not properly handling prop inheritance or class name composition. The CSS class `bx--list-box--light` is not being added to the class list when the `light` prop is true.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around prop handling and CSS class application in the Listbox component. The `light` prop, while being passed to the parent component, is not effectively reaching the underlying Listbox component, preventing the proper application of the light theme styling (`bx--list-box--light` class). This appears to be a component architecture issue where props are not being correctly passed through the component hierarchy. To fix this, the implementation needs to ensure proper prop drilling or state management between the parent dropdown and child Listbox components, and correct class name composition based on the received props.
