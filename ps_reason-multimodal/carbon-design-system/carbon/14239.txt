Let me analyze the problems and their causes based on the GitHub issue description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The StructuredList inside Expandable tile causes a role conflict when the tile is rendered as a button
**Cause**: Buttons cannot have children with ARIA roles, but the StructuredList elements inherently have roles. When the Expandable tile doesn't detect interactive content, it renders the entire tile as a button, creating this invalid DOM structure.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Need to add a hidden button as a workaround to force the "interactive" version of the Expandable tile
**Cause**: The Expandable tile component's logic for determining whether to use the interactive version appears to be solely based on the presence of interactive elements, rather than having a proper prop or configuration option to explicitly set this behavior.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: IBM Accessibility checker reports an error for the aria-expanded="false" attribute
**Cause**: Based on the screenshot, the ARIA attribute "aria-expanded" is not allowed in the current context. This suggests there might be a mismatch between the component's role and the ARIA attributes being applied, or the attribute is being applied to an element where it's not permitted according to ARIA specifications.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from three main architectural problems in the Expandable Tile component:
1. Role conflict between button functionality and structured content
2. Lack of proper configuration options for interactive vs non-interactive versions
3. Incorrect ARIA attribute implementation causing accessibility violations

The component needs to be redesigned to:
- Handle nested elements with roles properly
- Provide explicit control over interactive/non-interactive behavior
- Ensure proper ARIA attribute usage that complies with accessibility standards

These changes would eliminate the need for workarounds and improve accessibility compliance.
