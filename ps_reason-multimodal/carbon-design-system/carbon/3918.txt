Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIFs, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: No visual indicators for keyboard navigation in DataTable's OverflowMenu
**Cause**: The styling for keyboard focus/hover states is either missing or not being properly applied to OverflowMenuItem components when they are nested within a DataTable component. This appears to be a CSS inheritance or specificity issue where the DataTable's styles may be overriding the default OverflowMenu styles.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between standalone OverflowMenu and DataTable OverflowMenu
**Cause**: The integration between DataTable and OverflowMenu components isn't maintaining the accessibility features that exist in the standalone OverflowMenu. This suggests that the component composition isn't properly preserving the accessibility properties and event handlers when the OverflowMenu is used as a nested component.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor keyboard accessibility in DataTable's OverflowMenu
**Cause**: The lack of proper ARIA attributes or focus management in the nested implementation. When components are nested, they need to maintain their accessibility tree and focus management system, which appears to be broken in this case.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper component integration between DataTable and OverflowMenu, manifesting in three main problems: missing visual indicators for keyboard navigation, inconsistent behavior compared to standalone implementation, and compromised accessibility features. The root causes appear to be related to CSS specificity issues, component composition problems, and incomplete accessibility implementation when nesting components. To fix these issues, the development team would need to:
1. Ensure proper CSS inheritance for focus/hover states
2. Maintain accessibility features during component composition
3. Implement consistent keyboard navigation behavior across all contexts where OverflowMenu is used
