Let me analyze the ContentSwitcher issue based on the provided description and image.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor visual contrast between the ContentSwitcher component and ui-01 background
**Cause**: The current color tokens/values used for the ContentSwitcher component don't provide sufficient contrast when placed on light backgrounds (specifically ui-01 themed backgrounds)

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of flexibility in component theming
**Cause**: The ContentSwitcher component doesn't have a light variant/prop option unlike other components like TextInput, limiting its usability across different background contexts

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent component API pattern compared to other components
**Cause**: While similar components like TextInput provide light/dark variant options through props, the ContentSwitcher doesn't follow this established pattern, creating inconsistency in the component library

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the ContentSwitcher's visual presentation and customization limitations. The component suffers from poor contrast on light backgrounds (ui-01) due to inappropriate color token values. This is compounded by the lack of a light variant option, which other components in the library typically provide through a 'light' prop. This not only creates usability issues but also breaks the consistency of the component library's API patterns. The solution likely requires either:
1. Adjusting the default color tokens for better contrast
2. Adding a light variant through a new prop
3. Or potentially both approaches to provide maximum flexibility
