Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes for the React Expandable Tile component's accessibility issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When entering the Web area with VoiceOver (VO), nothing is focused and VO doesn't announce anything
**Cause**: Missing proper initial focus management and likely missing appropriate ARIA landmarks or heading structure to indicate the beginning of the content area

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expand button's state (expanded/collapsed) is not being announced by screen readers
**Cause**: Missing or improper implementation of aria-expanded attribute on the button element. The button should have aria-expanded="false" when collapsed and aria-expanded="true" when expanded

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Below the fold content is accessible and announced before the tile is expanded
**Cause**: Improper content hiding implementation. Content that should be hidden when collapsed is still in the accessibility tree and can be reached by screen readers

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The button label is not properly announced with its purpose/function
**Cause**: Missing appropriate aria-label or accessible name that describes the button's purpose (e.g., "Expand section" or "Show more content")

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: No announcement of state changes when the tile is expanded/collapsed
**Cause**: Missing live region updates or appropriate ARIA attributes to announce dynamic content changes when the tile's state changes

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The React Expandable Tile component has several accessibility issues primarily related to:
1. Poor initial focus management
2. Improper implementation of ARIA attributes for state management
3. Incorrect content hiding mechanism allowing access to collapsed content
4. Inadequate labeling of interactive elements
5. Missing state change announcements

These issues make the component difficult to use with screen readers and need to be addressed to make it fully accessible. The fixes would involve proper ARIA implementation, better focus management, and correct content hiding techniques.
