Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided screenshot, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown menu remains visible even after the sidenav retracts when the mouse leaves the sidenav area.
**Cause**: There appears to be a disconnect between the hover state management of the sidenav and the dropdown menu's visibility state. The dropdown menu's visibility is not properly tied to the sidenav's expanded/collapsed state.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The UI becomes inconsistent and confusing when the dropdown floats without its parent context
**Cause**: The z-index and positioning of the dropdown menu component is likely managed independently from the sidenav component, causing it to persist in the viewport even when its parent container (sidenav) changes state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user experience is broken as interactive elements remain accessible outside their intended context
**Cause**: The event handling for mouse leave/hover events is not properly cascading to child components. When the parent sidenav collapses, it's not triggering a cleanup of its child components' states.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper state management between the parent sidenav component and its child dropdown menu. There are three main problems: (1) disconnected state management between parent and child components, (2) incorrect handling of component visibility and positioning, and (3) incomplete event handling for mouse interactions. To fix this, the component needs to ensure that:
- The dropdown menu state is directly tied to the sidenav's expanded state
- All child components are properly cleaned up when the parent sidenav collapses
- The z-index and positioning hierarchy maintains proper parent-child relationships
- Mouse events are properly handled to trigger state changes for both parent and child components
