Let me analyze the search autocomplete color contrast issue in Chrome.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor color contrast between the cancel (X) button and the search input background in Chrome
**Cause**: Chrome's default autofill background color (skyblue) is conflicting with the cancel button's color scheme, making it difficult to see and reducing accessibility

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent search input appearance across browsers
**Cause**: Chrome's unique autofill styling behavior that applies a skyblue background color (-webkit-autofill), which differs from other browsers' default behaviors

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessibility standards violation
**Cause**: The contrast ratio between the cancel button and the autofill background color doesn't meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) requirements for minimum contrast

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from Chrome's default autofill behavior applying a skyblue background color that conflicts with the Carbon Components' search input styling. This creates three related problems: poor visibility of the cancel button, inconsistent cross-browser appearance, and accessibility violations. The root cause is the interaction between Chrome's built-in autofill styling and Carbon Components' design system, which wasn't accounting for browser-specific autofill backgrounds. This needs to be addressed either by:
1. Overriding Chrome's autofill background color
2. Adjusting the cancel button's color to maintain sufficient contrast
3. Implementing a custom autofill style that aligns with the design system
