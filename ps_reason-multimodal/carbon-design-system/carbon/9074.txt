Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes based on the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: FormGroup component doesn't allow setting custom ID for the legend element
**Cause**: The current implementation of FormGroup only allows passing arbitrary props to the fieldset element, but not to the legend element, making it impossible to set a custom ID for proper screen reader support.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: RadioButtonGroup component lacks support for custom attributes on both fieldset and legend elements
**Cause**: The RadioButtonGroup component's implementation doesn't provide any mechanism to pass custom attributes to either the fieldset or legend elements, making it impossible to establish proper ARIA relationships.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing proper ARIA labeling relationship between fieldset and legend
**Cause**: Without the ability to set custom IDs on legend elements and corresponding aria-labelledby attributes on fieldsets, the screen reader cannot properly announce the relationship between the fieldset content and its label (legend), impacting accessibility.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around accessibility limitations in both FormGroup and RadioButtonGroup components. The components currently lack the ability to properly establish relationships between fieldsets and their legends through custom IDs and ARIA attributes. This affects three main areas:
1. FormGroup's legend customization limitations
2. RadioButtonGroup's complete lack of attribute customization
3. Inability to create proper ARIA relationships for screen readers

These issues need to be addressed to ensure proper accessibility support, particularly for screen reader users in the IBM Cloud UI's settings dropdown menu implementation.
