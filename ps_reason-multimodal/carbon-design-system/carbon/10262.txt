Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: PropType validation error when using non-string children in TooltipDefinition component
**Cause**: The component's PropTypes definition restricts the 'children' prop to only accept string values, while developers need to use other React elements like `<h3>`, `<p>`, etc.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to wrap TooltipDefinition inside heading tags
**Cause**: The TooltipDefinition component renders as a button element, which creates invalid HTML structure when placed inside heading tags (as buttons cannot be children of heading elements according to HTML specifications)

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited component flexibility and reusability
**Cause**: The strict typing of children prop to strings prevents the component from being used with more complex UI structures and components, reducing its utility in real-world applications

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the TooltipDefinition component's restrictive PropTypes definition, which only accepts strings as children. This limitation causes three main problems:
1. PropType validation errors when using non-string children
2. HTML structure conflicts when trying to nest the component
3. Reduced component reusability

The solution would involve changing the PropTypes definition from string to node (`PropTypes.node`), allowing the component to accept various types of React elements as children. However, the HTML structure issue with button elements inside headings would need to be addressed separately, possibly through a different architectural approach.
