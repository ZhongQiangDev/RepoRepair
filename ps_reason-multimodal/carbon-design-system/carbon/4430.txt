Let me analyze the DataTable selection behavior issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Select All" checkbox selects all items in the table even when a search filter is applied, instead of only selecting the filtered/visible items.
**Cause**: The DataTable's "Select All" functionality is likely implemented to work on the entire dataset rather than the currently filtered/visible rows. The selection logic is not considering the search/filter state of the table.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The selection count shows "3 items selected" when only 1 item is visible in the filtered view.
**Cause**: The selection counter is counting all selected items in the underlying data array, not just the visible/filtered items. This creates a misleading user experience as it doesn't match what users can see on screen.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There's no visual indication that hidden rows are being selected.
**Cause**: The UI design doesn't provide feedback about selections happening outside the current view. Users have no way to know that their "Select All" action is affecting rows they can't see.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a disconnect between the table's filtering and selection mechanisms. The selection logic operates on the full dataset while users expect it to work only on their current filtered view. This creates three main problems:
1. Unexpected selection of hidden rows
2. Misleading selection count
3. Poor visibility of selection scope

To fix these issues, the DataTable implementation should:
- Modify the "Select All" behavior to only affect filtered/visible rows
- Update the selection counter to reflect only visible selected items
- Add clear visual feedback about selection scope
- Consider adding warnings when actions might affect hidden items
