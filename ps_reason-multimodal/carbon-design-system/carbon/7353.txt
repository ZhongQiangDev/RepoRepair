Let me analyze the accessibility issues in the Tabs component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Button elements in the Tabs component lack proper accessibility labels
**Cause**: The <button> elements are missing required accessibility attributes like aria-labelledby, for, or title that would provide context to assistive technologies about their purpose and function

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No visible labels associated with tab buttons when screen width is reduced
**Cause**: The responsive design implementation fails to maintain proper labeling when the layout changes for smaller screens, breaking the connection between buttons and their descriptive text

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Violation of WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines (specifically IBM 3.3.2)
**Cause**: The component implementation doesn't follow the required technique H44 which mandates that form control elements must have associated labels for accessibility compliance

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor screen reader and voice control support
**Cause**: Without proper labels and ARIA attributes, assistive technologies cannot properly announce or interact with the tab buttons, making the component unusable for users with visual impairments or those using voice control

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete accessibility implementation in the Tabs component, particularly when it comes to button labeling. The component needs to be updated to:
1. Add proper aria-labelledby or for attributes to connect buttons with their labels
2. Maintain accessible labels across all responsive breakpoints
3. Implement proper WCAG 2.1 techniques for form controls
4. Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies through appropriate HTML structure and ARIA attributes

These changes would make the component fully accessible to all users, regardless of their method of interaction or assistive technology usage.
