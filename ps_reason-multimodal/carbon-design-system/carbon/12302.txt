Let me analyze the pagination issue based on the provided information and screenshots.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Redundant display of page numbers in the pagination component
**Cause**: When the `pagesUnknown` prop is set to true, the component is displaying the page number twice - once in the select dropdown and once as text ("page X"). This appears to be a UI implementation issue where the text template isn't properly accounting for the presence of the select dropdown when `pagesUnknown` is true.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent with other Carbon implementations
**Cause**: The issue has been identified in Carbon Angular, suggesting this is a cross-framework inconsistency in the Carbon Design System. The React implementation likely diverged from the intended design pattern, resulting in this redundancy that isn't present in other framework implementations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor UX due to information repetition
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't follow the suggested format of "Page <select element with number>", instead it's showing "<number> page <number>". This appears to be a template string issue in the component's render logic that's not properly handling the `pagesUnknown` prop condition.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper handling of the `pagesUnknown` prop in the React implementation of the Carbon pagination component. This results in three related problems:
1. Redundant display of page numbers
2. Inconsistency with other Carbon framework implementations
3. Sub-optimal user experience due to repeated information

The root cause appears to be in the component's template logic, which needs to be updated to handle the `pagesUnknown` prop correctly by showing only one instance of the page number within the select dropdown, following the format "Page <select element with number>". This would align with other Carbon framework implementations and provide a better user experience.
