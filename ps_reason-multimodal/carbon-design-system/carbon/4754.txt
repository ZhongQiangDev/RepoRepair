Based on the GitHub problem description, this is not actually describing a bug or wrong behavior - it's a feature request/enhancement proposal. The user is suggesting adding a new `align` prop to the Carbon Design System's Accordion component to make the chevron alignment configurable.

However, I can analyze the current limitations that prompted this request:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of flexibility in chevron alignment positioning
**Cause**: The Carbon Accordion component currently only supports end-aligned chevrons without the ability to customize the position through props

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Teams need to use style overrides to achieve different chevron alignments
**Cause**: Without a built-in prop for alignment control, developers have to resort to CSS overrides which is not ideal for maintainability and consistency

### Conclusion
**Summary**: This is a feature enhancement request rather than a bug report. The main issue is that the Carbon Accordion component lacks built-in flexibility for chevron positioning, forcing teams to either:
1. Accept the default end-alignment which may not meet their design requirements
2. Implement custom CSS overrides to achieve different alignments

The proposed solution is to add an `align` prop that would allow users to toggle between 'start' and 'end' alignment through the component's API rather than through CSS overrides. This would improve component flexibility while maintaining proper implementation patterns.

The request is particularly relevant since there are documented use cases within the IBM Security portfolio requiring both alignment options, suggesting this would be a valuable addition to the core Carbon component library.
