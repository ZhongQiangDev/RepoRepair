From reviewing the GitHub issue and provided images, this appears to be a feature request rather than a problem description. The issue is requesting the addition of new icon-only variants for two types of tabs components. Let me break down the requirements and implementation considerations:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Current tab components don't support icon-only variants
**Cause**: Missing implementation of icon-only variants in both Line Tabs and ContainedTabs components

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of consistent spacing and sizing for icon-only tabs
**Cause**: Need to establish specific dimensions:
- Height: 48px (as shown in mockups)
- Width: 20px for icons
- Need proper padding/spacing between icon-only tabs

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No clear visual distinction between selected and unselected states in icon-only variants
**Cause**: Need to implement:
- Active state indicators (underline for Line Tabs)
- Background highlighting for ContainedTabs
- Color changes for selected state

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential accessibility issues with icon-only tabs
**Cause**: Missing:
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Tooltip implementation for icon meaning
- Keyboard navigation support

### Conclusion
**Summary**: This is a feature request to implement icon-only variants for both Line Tabs and ContainedTabs components. The implementation needs to consider:
1. Creating new icon-only variants for both tab types
2. Implementing proper spacing and sizing (48px height, 20px icon width)
3. Ensuring clear visual indicators for selected/unselected states
4. Adding necessary accessibility features

The implementation should maintain consistency with existing tab components while providing a more compact, icon-focused alternative for specific use cases.
