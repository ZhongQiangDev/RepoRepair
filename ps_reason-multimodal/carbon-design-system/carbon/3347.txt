Let me analyze the issues based on the provided GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent button styling between Modal and ComposedModal components when the danger property is set to true. Specifically, the left (Cancel) button appears gray in ComposedModal but black in Modal.
**Cause**: This is due to different kind property assignments in the components' source code:
- Modal component uses `kind="secondary"` (black) for the left button
- ComposedModal component uses conditional statement `kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}` which results in 'tertiary' (gray) when danger is true

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: CodeSandbox environment is not recognizing the ComposedModal component
**Cause**: This could be due to either:
- Missing import statement for ComposedModal
- Incorrect package version in the CodeSandbox environment
- Potential configuration issues in the sandbox setup

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around inconsistent styling behavior between Modal and ComposedModal components in Carbon Design System v10. The critical difference lies in how the kind property is handled for the left button when danger=true (secondary vs tertiary). This appears to be an implementation inconsistency rather than a bug, but it creates confusion for developers expecting consistent behavior across similar components. The secondary issue with CodeSandbox prevents proper testing and reproduction of the problem, though this is likely a configuration or setup issue rather than a component problem.

The primary fix would need to address the consistency between Modal and ComposedModal components' button styling logic, specifically when handling danger states. A decision needs to be made on whether to standardize on secondary (black) or tertiary (gray) for the left button in danger scenarios.
