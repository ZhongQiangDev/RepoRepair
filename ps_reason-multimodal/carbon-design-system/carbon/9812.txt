Let me analyze the issues and causes based on the provided GitHub problem description and images:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Insufficient shadow contrast in dark themes (G90 and G100) compared to light theme (G10)
**Cause**: Current shadow opacity is set to 30% (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)) for all themes, which doesn't provide enough visual distinction in darker backgrounds

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Modal overlay lacks sufficient contrast in dark themes
**Cause**: Current overlay color uses #161616 which doesn't create enough visual separation between the modal and the background content

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent shadow visibility across different theme modes
**Cause**: Using the same shadow opacity value (0.3) across all themes doesn't account for the different background colors' impact on shadow perception

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor component hierarchy visualization in dark themes
**Cause**: The current shadow implementation doesn't effectively communicate elevation and layering in darker themes due to insufficient contrast

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around inadequate contrast and visual hierarchy in dark themes (G90 and G100). The current implementation uses the same shadow opacity (30%) across all themes, which works well for light themes but fails to provide sufficient contrast in dark modes. The proposed solutions include:
1. Increasing shadow opacity to 70-80% for dark themes
2. Changing the modal overlay color to #000000 with 65% opacity
3. Implementing different shadow opacity values for different theme modes to maintain consistent visual hierarchy

These changes need to be implemented before IBM Cloud's dark mode rollout to clients in January to ensure proper visual hierarchy and component distinction across all theme variations.
