Based on the image provided, I'll analyze the DAP (Dynamic Assessment Program) errors shown in the MultiSelect.Filterable component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate ID attribute values in the document
**Cause**: The element with ID 'carbon-multiselect-example' is being used multiple times in the document, violating the HTML specification that requires ID attributes to be unique.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: WAI-ARIA role containment violations
**Cause**: The "option" role elements are not properly contained within or owned by elements with the required WAI-ARIA roles "listbox". This breaks the ARIA specification's required parent-child relationship hierarchy.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple accessibility violations (shown by the "9 Violations" counter)
**Cause**: The component implementation doesn't fully comply with accessibility standards, particularly around proper ARIA attribute usage and role relationships.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential violations indicated (shown by "10 Potential Violations")
**Cause**: There are several implementation patterns that might cause accessibility issues but require human verification to determine if they are actual problems.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues center around accessibility compliance problems in the MultiSelect.Filterable component:
1. Non-unique ID attributes causing DOM conflicts
2. Improper ARIA role hierarchy implementation
3. Multiple confirmed accessibility violations
4. Several potential accessibility issues requiring review

These issues need to be addressed to ensure proper accessibility support and compliance with web standards. The component's structure needs to be refactored to properly implement ARIA roles and relationships, and ensure unique ID attributes throughout the document.
