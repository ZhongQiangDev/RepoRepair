Based on the provided GitHub problem description and screenshots, I'll analyze the accessibility violations found by DAP and Axe-Core:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Invalid WAI-ARIA property identifier for aria-owns and aria-controls attributes
**Cause**: The dropdown component uses invalid IDs "carbon-dropdown-example__menu" for both aria-owns and aria-controls attributes. The issue appears because these IDs contain invalid characters (double underscores) which don't conform to valid ID naming conventions in HTML/ARIA specifications.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessible name does not contain the visible label text
**Cause**: The dropdown component's accessible name (likely provided through aria-label or similar attributes) doesn't match or include the visible text that users can see on the screen. This creates a disconnect between what sighted users see and what screen reader users hear, leading to poor accessibility.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The React Dropdown component has two main accessibility issues:
1. Technical implementation problem with invalid ARIA attribute values that don't follow proper ID naming conventions
2. Semantic issue where the accessible name doesn't properly reflect the visible UI text

To fix these issues, the development team should:
- Ensure all ARIA IDs follow valid naming conventions (avoiding double underscores)
- Make sure the accessible name matches or includes the visible label text
- Validate ARIA attributes implementation against WAI-ARIA specifications
- Test with screen readers to verify the fixes improve the actual user experience

These changes will improve the component's accessibility and make it more usable for people relying on assistive technologies.
