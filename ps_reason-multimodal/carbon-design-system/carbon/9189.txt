Let me analyze the problem and its causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The breadcrumb overflow menu is not displaying the shark fin (dropdown indicator) correctly and has incorrect positioning.

**Cause**: The issue stems from the displayName property not being set correctly due to the implementation of `createComponentToggle`. The code shows that the displayName is being set to "FeatureToggle(OverflowMenu)" instead of just "OverflowMenu", which affects the conditional rendering logic in the BreadcrumbItem component.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The conditional check for overflow menu type is failing.

**Cause**: In the code, there's a condition checking:
```javascript
children.type.displayName !== undefined && 
children.type.displayName === 'OverflowMenu'
```
However, due to the component being wrapped in a FeatureToggle, the displayName is actually "FeatureToggle(OverflowMenu)" which causes this condition to fail.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The styling and positioning of the overflow menu are not being applied correctly.

**Cause**: Since the condition fails due to the incorrect displayName, the specific styling properties (including the horizontalOverflowIcon and menuOffset) are not being properly applied to the overflow menu component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the component's displayName property being modified by the `createComponentToggle` wrapper. This causes the conditional checks in the BreadcrumbItem component to fail, which in turn prevents the proper application of styling and positioning for the overflow menu and its shark fin indicator. The main fix would likely involve either:
1. Modifying the displayName check to account for the FeatureToggle wrapper
2. Ensuring the original displayName is preserved after the component is wrapped
3. Finding an alternative way to identify the OverflowMenu component that doesn't rely on the displayName property
