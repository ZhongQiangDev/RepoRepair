Based on the GitHub problem description and provided images, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The ComboBox selection element shows multiselect styling (× icon) when it should be a single select
**Cause**: CSS/Component styling rules for multiselect are being incorrectly applied to single select ComboBox component, resulting in the unnecessary close (×) button appearing in the selection area

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Invalid state selection icon (red circle with exclamation mark) is misaligned
**Cause**: Incorrect CSS positioning properties for the validation icon, likely due to:
- Missing or incorrect margin/padding values
- Improper alignment properties (flex/grid positioning)
- Wrong absolute/relative positioning values

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown arrow (▼) and clear (×) icons appear to be overlapping or too close together
**Cause**: Insufficient spacing in the right-side controls area of the ComboBox, likely due to:
- Missing margin between control icons
- Incorrect container width calculations
- Improper flex/grid spacing properties

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The ComboBox component has three main styling issues:
1. Incorrect application of multiselect styles to a single select component
2. Misaligned validation icon in error state
3. Poor spacing between control icons

These issues appear to stem from CSS styling conflicts and incorrect positioning properties. The fixes would involve:
- Removing multiselect styles from single select variant
- Adjusting validation icon positioning
- Implementing proper spacing between control elements

All these issues seem to be purely presentational and don't affect the functionality of the ComboBox component itself.
