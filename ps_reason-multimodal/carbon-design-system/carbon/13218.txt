Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The caption prop is defined in propTypes but not implemented in the ActionableNotification component
**Cause**: There's a disconnect between the component's prop definition and its implementation. While the code shows that caption is properly defined in propTypes with string validation, the actual component doesn't render or use this prop value anywhere in its implementation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Documentation suggests caption functionality that doesn't work
**Cause**: The Carbon component documentation shows caption as a valid prop with the description "Specify the caption", leading developers to believe this is a working feature. However, since the implementation is missing, this creates a misleading documentation issue.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No error or warning is shown when caption prop is used but not rendered
**Cause**: Despite React's prop-types validation being present, the component silently fails to render the caption without any warning to developers. This happens because the prop is properly typed but the corresponding rendering logic is missing in the component implementation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an incomplete implementation of the ActionableNotification component where the caption prop is properly defined in propTypes but lacks actual implementation in the component's render logic. This creates three main problems: 1) a non-functioning caption prop despite being defined, 2) misleading documentation that suggests caption functionality exists, and 3) silent failure when developers attempt to use the caption prop. This appears to be a case where the component's interface was defined but the implementation was either overlooked or not completed. The severity 2 rating is appropriate as it prevents users from implementing important notification features like timestamps, with no available workaround within the component itself.
