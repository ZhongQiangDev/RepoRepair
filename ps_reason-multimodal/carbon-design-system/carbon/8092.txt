Let me analyze the select component's warning state implementation based on the provided image.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning state visual treatment is not consistent across different variations shown in the design
**Cause**: The spacing and positioning of the warning icon varies between the three examples shown, with different measurements (8px, 16px) being used inconsistently

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message styling and placement is not clearly defined
**Cause**: The design shows "Warning message here" text but doesn't specify:
- Text color for warning messages
- Font size and weight
- Spacing between the select input and warning message
- Whether the message should be left-aligned with the input

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning icon specifications are incomplete
**Cause**: While some icon properties are defined (support-03 fill, black inner fill, 16px size), there's no clear specification for:
- Icon color in different states (hover, focus, disabled)
- Icon behavior when select is opened/closed
- Icon positioning relative to the chevron/dropdown arrow

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The select input border treatment for warning state is not defined
**Cause**: The design doesn't specify:
- Border color for warning state
- Border thickness
- Whether the border color changes on hover/focus
- If there should be a different background color for warning state

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The warning state implementation for the select component needs more detailed specifications around:
1. Consistent spacing and positioning of warning elements
2. Complete warning message styling guidelines
3. Comprehensive warning icon states and behavior
4. Clear input border and background treatments for warning state

These missing specifications could lead to inconsistent implementation across the application and potential accessibility issues. A more detailed design system documentation would help ensure consistent warning state implementation.
