Let me analyze the accessibility issues described in this GitHub problem:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TableContainer's title and description nodes lack unique IDs for accessibility references
**Cause**: The implementation doesn't generate or assign unique IDs to the title and description elements within the TableContainer component, making it impossible to reference them properly using aria-labelledby or aria-describedby attributes

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Tables must rely on a single ID from TableContainer for both title and description
**Cause**: Due to the missing individual IDs, developers are forced to combine both title and description content under a single ID on the TableContainer, which is not the optimal semantic structure for accessibility

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Developers must fall back to using aria-label
**Cause**: Without proper ID references, developers need to use aria-label as an alternative, which goes against ARIA best practices when the label text is visible on screen

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: JAWS screen reader falls back to using table rows for labeling
**Cause**: When neither aria-label nor aria-labelledby attributes are present, the screen reader has to improvise by using table row content as labels, which may not provide the intended context or hierarchy of information

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the TableContainer component's lack of proper ID management for its title and description elements. This causes a cascade of accessibility problems: inability to properly reference labels and descriptions, forced use of non-optimal ARIA patterns, and poor screen reader behavior. The solution would involve implementing unique ID generation for both title and description nodes, allowing proper aria-labelledby and aria-describedby references to maintain accessibility best practices and provide better screen reader support.
