Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Row height discrepancy between Carbon Design System (48px) and React implementation (52px)
**Cause**: The missing CSS class `bx--table-column-checkbox` on the table cell (`<td>`) containing the checkbox in the React implementation. This class is responsible for proper styling and spacing of the checkbox column.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent HTML structure between Carbon Design System example and React implementation
**Cause**: The React component `TableSelectRow` is not properly applying the necessary CSS class to the checkbox column. This appears to be an implementation issue in the React component library (carbon-components-react 7.5.0).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: CSS styling inheritance not working as expected in React implementation
**Cause**: The missing class `bx--table-column-checkbox` prevents proper style inheritance from Carbon's base CSS styles, leading to different spacing and sizing calculations for the row height.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the React implementation of `TableSelectRow` not properly applying the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class to the checkbox column's td element. This missing class causes:
1. Incorrect row height (52px instead of 48px)
2. Inconsistent styling compared to the Carbon Design System documentation
3. Breaking the expected styling inheritance chain

To fix this, the React component needs to be updated to ensure it applies the correct CSS class to the checkbox column. This appears to be a bug in the carbon-components-react package version 7.5.0.

The issue could be resolved by:
1. Updating to a newer version of carbon-components-react if the bug has been fixed
2. Filing a bug report with the Carbon team if this is still an issue
3. Creating a temporary CSS override as a workaround
