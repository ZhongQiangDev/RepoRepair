Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The IconButton component shows incorrect right padding that appears larger than it should be
**Cause**: The component is incorrectly inheriting or applying the medium (md) button padding values instead of using the specific IconButton padding specifications

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent padding distribution around the icon
**Cause**: The padding calculation logic in the IconButton component is likely using the standard Button component's padding formula, which is designed for buttons with text rather than just icons

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual imbalance in the IconButton's overall appearance
**Cause**: The misaligned padding creates an asymmetrical look, suggesting that the component's CSS styles are not properly isolated from the parent Button component's styles

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from incorrect padding implementation in the IconButton component. The component appears to be inheriting padding values from the standard Button component instead of using IconButton-specific padding values. This results in three related problems: excessive right padding, inconsistent padding distribution, and visual imbalance. The root cause appears to be in the component's CSS architecture, where the IconButton variant is not properly overriding or implementing its own padding specifications separate from the standard Button component's padding calculations.

To fix this, the development team should:
1. Review the IconButton's padding specifications
2. Ensure proper CSS specificity for IconButton styles
3. Implement IconButton-specific padding calculations
4. Isolate IconButton styles from standard Button padding inheritance
