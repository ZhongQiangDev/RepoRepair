Based on the GitHub issue description and screenshots provided, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The search icon in the DataTable is misaligned when in its default state
**Cause**: Incorrect CSS positioning or padding values in the base styling of the search icon button component. The icon appears to be positioned too high within its container.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The search icon's hover state appears visually broken or offset
**Cause**: The hover state styles are likely not properly accounting for the icon's position or the button's boundaries. This could be due to:
- Inconsistent padding/margin values between default and hover states
- Incorrect transformation values during the hover animation
- Misaligned background highlight area relative to the icon

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The search icon's container appears to have inconsistent spacing compared to other toolbar elements
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect spacing utilities or margin/padding values in the toolbar component's layout system. This creates visual imbalance with adjacent elements like the settings icon and primary button.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The DataTable's search icon functionality suffers from three main UI issues: base misalignment, broken hover state, and inconsistent spacing. These problems appear to stem from CSS styling issues related to positioning, hover state handling, and layout spacing values. The core issue seems to be in the component's style definitions rather than functional JavaScript code. To fix these issues, the CSS properties controlling the icon's position, hover state, and spacing need to be reviewed and adjusted to match the design system's specifications.
