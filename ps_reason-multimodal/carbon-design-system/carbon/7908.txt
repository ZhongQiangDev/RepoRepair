Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Nested interactive elements - button inside another button
**Cause**: The implementation shows a "Clear Selection" button nested inside the main multiselect button element, which violates HTML semantics and accessibility guidelines. Interactive elements should not be nested within other interactive elements.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Violation of W3C HTML5 specification
**Cause**: The current implementation directly violates W3C HTML5 spec 4.10.6 which explicitly states that "there must be no interactive content descendant" within a button element. The nested button structure breaks this fundamental specification.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor accessibility implementation
**Cause**: The nested button structure creates confusion for screen readers and keyboard navigation. Screen readers may announce both buttons inconsistently, and keyboard focus behavior becomes unpredictable between the parent and child buttons.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Redundant ARIA attributes and roles
**Cause**: The code shows multiple overlapping ARIA attributes and roles (role="button" appears multiple times), which can cause conflicts in how assistive technologies interpret and announce the component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The multiselect component has several critical issues stemming from improper HTML structure and accessibility implementation. The main problem is the nested button structure, which violates W3C specifications and creates accessibility barriers. This is compounded by redundant ARIA attributes that further complicate the user experience for those using assistive technologies. To fix these issues, the component should be restructured to:
1. Avoid nesting interactive elements
2. Use proper HTML semantics
3. Streamline ARIA attributes
4. Ensure clear and consistent keyboard navigation
A possible solution would be to implement the clear selection functionality as a separate, adjacent button rather than nesting it within the multiselect button.
