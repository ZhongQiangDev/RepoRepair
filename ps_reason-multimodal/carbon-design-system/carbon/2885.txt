Let me analyze the accessibility issue with the toggle component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: VoiceOver screen reader does not announce the On/Off labels for the toggle component
**Cause**: The presence of `aria-hidden="true"` on the toggle text elements is preventing VoiceOver from reading the state labels. This attribute explicitly tells assistive technologies to ignore these elements, making them invisible to screen readers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incomplete accessibility implementation for the toggle component
**Cause**: The code appears to rely only on visual indicators (the toggle appearance) without proper ARIA attributes to convey the component's state and role. A toggle/switch component should have:
- `role="switch"` to identify it as a toggle
- `aria-checked` to indicate the current state
- Properly associated labels that aren't hidden from assistive technologies

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potentially confusing user experience for screen reader users
**Cause**: The component structure uses multiple nested spans with different classes for styling, but doesn't follow best practices for accessible custom form controls. The relationship between the visual labels and the actual control state may not be properly established in the accessibility tree.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the improper use of `aria-hidden="true"` which blocks VoiceOver from announcing the toggle state labels. This is compounded by an incomplete implementation of ARIA attributes and roles needed for proper screen reader support. To fix these issues:
1. Remove the `aria-hidden="true"` attributes from the state labels
2. Add appropriate ARIA roles and states
3. Ensure proper label associations
4. Restructure the component to follow accessibility best practices for custom form controls

These changes would ensure that screen reader users can properly understand and interact with the toggle component.
