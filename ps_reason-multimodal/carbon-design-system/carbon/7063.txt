Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Ordered lists in Firefox start from an arbitrary number (7) instead of 1
**Cause**: The Carbon component uses a custom CSS counter system with `counter-reset: item` property, which is interfering with the native ordered list numbering in Firefox specifically

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to override the custom counter styles through CSS
**Cause**: The Carbon component's counter styles are deeply embedded in the component's CSS structure using `::before` pseudo-elements and custom counters, making it difficult to override through normal CSS specificity rules

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No built-in option to use native ordered list styling
**Cause**: Carbon's design system enforces its own custom numbering system through CSS (using `::before` and `counter-increment: item`), without providing a configuration option to fall back to native browser ordered list rendering

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between Firefox and other browsers
**Cause**: Firefox's implementation of CSS counters and ordered lists appears to handle the interaction between custom counters and native list numbering differently than other browsers, exposing an edge case in the Carbon component's styling approach

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Carbon's opinionated approach to styling ordered lists using custom CSS counters instead of native browser functionality. This creates several problems:
1. Browser inconsistency (particularly in Firefox)
2. Inability to override the custom styling
3. No built-in way to use native ordered list behavior
4. The only working solution is to completely remove the custom counter styles, rather than being able to override them

The fundamental solution would be for Carbon to provide an option to use native ordered list styling when needed, rather than forcing the custom counter implementation in all cases.
