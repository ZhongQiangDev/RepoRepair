Let me analyze the issues with the RadioTile validation based on the provided description and images.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Required attribute needs to be specified on every RadioTile instead of just once on the TileGroup
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't properly propagate the required validation from the TileGroup to its child RadioTile components. This creates unnecessary repetition in the code and violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Validation error message appears in an incorrect position
**Cause**: The invisible underlying input element that handles the native form validation is not properly positioned within the component structure. The CSS positioning of the input element isn't configured correctly in the default implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Validation UI/UX is not user-friendly
**Cause**: The current positioning of the validation message (at the top) makes it difficult for users to associate the error with the entire radio tile group. This is because the native browser validation popup appears in a position that doesn't clearly indicate it's related to the whole group of options.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent with standard radio button group behavior
**Cause**: Traditional radio button groups typically handle required validation at the group level, not the individual radio button level. The current implementation deviates from this expected behavior, potentially causing confusion for developers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The RadioTile validation implementation has four main issues: redundant required attributes on individual tiles, incorrect positioning of the validation message, poor validation UI/UX, and inconsistency with standard radio group behavior. These issues stem from both architectural decisions in the component's implementation and CSS positioning problems. The main fixes needed are:
1. Moving the required validation to the TileGroup level
2. Repositioning the underlying input element to the bottom middle of the tile group
3. Improving the validation message positioning for better user experience
4. Aligning the implementation with standard radio group behavior

These changes would significantly improve both the developer experience and end-user experience with the RadioTile component.
