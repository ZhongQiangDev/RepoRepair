I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub issue description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The tab component switches to dropdown based on browser width instead of available component width
**Cause**: The implementation uses window/viewport width as the breakpoint trigger rather than measuring the actual space available to the component itself, which can lead to inappropriate transformations when the component is placed in different layout contexts

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessibility issues with screen readers when tabs transform to dropdown
**Cause**: The dynamic switching between tabs and dropdown changes the underlying HTML markup from a tablist to a listbox/dropdown structure, which creates confusion for screen reader users and breaks the expected tab navigation pattern

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of tab-based navigation model in responsive view
**Cause**: The current implementation completely changes the interaction model from tabs to dropdown when space is constrained, which deviates from the standard tab pattern and creates an inconsistent user experience

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential usability issues for teams using the component
**Cause**: The current implementation may be actively used by teams who depend on this behavior, making it risky to remove without a proper alternative solution or migration path

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The tab component has several fundamental issues:
1. Incorrect responsive behavior triggering based on browser width instead of component width
2. Accessibility problems due to changing ARIA roles and markup structure
3. Inconsistent interaction model between desktop and mobile views
4. Potential backward compatibility concerns for existing implementations

The core problems stem from the component's approach to handling responsive design by completely changing its interaction pattern rather than maintaining a consistent tab-based interface that adapts to different screen sizes. This affects both usability and accessibility, suggesting a need for a redesign that maintains the tab pattern while handling space constraints in a more appropriate way.
