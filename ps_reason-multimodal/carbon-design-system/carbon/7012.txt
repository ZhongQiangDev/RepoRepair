Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the issues and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent button sizes across different parts of the interface
**Cause**: Lack of standardized button size variants in the component library, specifically for larger buttons (64px and 80px heights) that are needed in certain contexts like modals and creation flows

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Small buttons at the bottom right of pages are getting overlooked
**Cause**: Current button sizes don't provide enough visual weight and prominence for important actions, making them less noticeable to users

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent visual hierarchy in the interface
**Cause**: Without larger button size options, it's difficult to establish proper visual hierarchy where certain actions need more emphasis than others

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Design system limitations for different use cases
**Cause**: The current button component doesn't accommodate all common use cases in the product, such as modal buttons (64px) and creation flow buttons (80px)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the lack of larger button size variants in the design system, which causes inconsistency across the interface and usability problems. The current button component needs to be extended to include two new size variants: 'xl' (80px/10rem) and 'large' (64px/8rem). These additions will help solve multiple problems:
1. Improve button visibility and usability
2. Create better visual hierarchy
3. Maintain consistency across different interface contexts
4. Provide proper sizing options for different use cases like modals and creation flows

The proposed solution of adding these two new size variants appears to be a logical approach to address all identified issues.
