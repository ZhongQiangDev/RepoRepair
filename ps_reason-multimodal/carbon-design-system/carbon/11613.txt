Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes based on the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Show Code" button displays incorrect code content, showing FeatureFlags tags instead of the actual Notifications component code
**Cause**: There appears to be an issue with the documentation system's code snippet generation. Instead of pulling the actual component implementation code, it's exposing internal feature flag wrapper code that should be invisible to end users.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code shown includes a "<No Display Name />" component which seems irrelevant
**Cause**: This suggests there's a problem with the component registration or naming in the documentation system. The actual component name isn't being properly resolved, resulting in a generic "No Display Name" placeholder.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue potentially affects other components' documentation sections beyond just Notifications
**Cause**: Since this appears to be related to how the documentation system generates code examples, it's likely a systemic issue in how components are wrapped with FeatureFlags in the documentation build process, affecting multiple components.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from problems in the documentation system's code example generation pipeline. Instead of showing the actual implementation code that developers need, it's exposing internal feature flag infrastructure code. This manifests in three main ways:
1. Incorrect code content showing FeatureFlags wrapper
2. Missing component names showing as "No Display Name"
3. Potential widespread impact across multiple components

The fix would likely involve:
- Adjusting the documentation build process to strip out FeatureFlags wrapper code
- Ensuring proper component name resolution
- Verifying the code example generation process across all components
