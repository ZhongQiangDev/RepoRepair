Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Background content remains scrollable when the modal is open
**Cause**: The Carbon Components library doesn't automatically prevent scrolling of the parent/body element when a modal is opened. This is likely because there's no built-in scroll lock mechanism or CSS class (like Bootstrap's `modal-open`) that gets applied to the body element.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor user experience due to simultaneous modal and background interaction
**Cause**: The implementation lacks proper focus management and interaction blocking. When a modal is open, it should act as a focused, isolated interface element, but the current implementation allows background interactions to continue.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential accessibility issues
**Cause**: The ability to scroll the background while a modal is open can create confusion for screen readers and keyboard navigation users, as it's unclear which context (modal or background) is currently active. This stems from insufficient ARIA role management and focus containment.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around the lack of proper scroll and interaction management when modals are open in the Carbon Components library. Unlike other UI libraries like Bootstrap, it doesn't automatically disable background scrolling, which can lead to poor user experience and accessibility issues. The root causes are:
1. Missing scroll lock mechanism
2. Insufficient interaction blocking
3. Incomplete modal focus management

To fix these issues, the library would need to implement:
- A scroll lock mechanism similar to Bootstrap's `modal-open` class
- Proper focus trapping within the modal
- Better ARIA role management for accessibility
- Clear interaction boundaries between the modal and background content
