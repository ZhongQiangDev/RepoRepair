Based on the GitHub problem description and screenshots, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Insufficient contrast ratio for the "Skip to Main" link
**Cause**: The contrast ratio of 1.91 between the text and its background does not meet WCAG AA minimum requirements for text of size 14px and weight of 400. WCAG guidelines require a higher contrast ratio for accessibility compliance.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing proper WAI-ARIA role hierarchy in navigation menu
**Cause**: Elements with menuitem roles are not properly contained within a parent element that has the appropriate WAI-ARIA role (menu, menubar, or group). This creates an invalid ARIA structure that affects accessibility, particularly when the page is resized and links don't display across the top.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Skip to Main content link implementation issues
**Cause**: The implementation doesn't follow WCAG technique G1 requirements for providing a proper "Skip to Main" navigation link at the top of each page. This affects users who rely on keyboard navigation to bypass repetitive navigation elements.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Improper ARIA labeling in navigation structure
**Cause**: The navigation elements use aria-label attributes but lack proper role relationships between parent and child elements, as evidenced in the HTML structure shown in the screenshot.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues primarily revolve around accessibility compliance failures in the header navigation component. The main problems are:
1. Poor contrast ratios that don't meet WCAG standards
2. Incorrect implementation of WAI-ARIA roles and hierarchy
3. Non-compliant Skip to Main content link
4. Improper ARIA labeling structure

These issues need to be addressed to ensure the component meets accessibility standards and provides a better experience for users relying on assistive technologies. The fixes should focus on proper contrast ratios, correct ARIA role implementation, and proper skip navigation functionality.
