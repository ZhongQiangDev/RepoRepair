Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided screenshot, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The small ghost button height is 36px when it should be 32px
**Cause**: CSS height property or padding values in the button component's styles are not properly configured for the small variant of the ghost button. The current implementation appears to be using the default button height instead of the small button specifications.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency with design system specifications
**Cause**: The implementation does not follow the agreed-upon design specifications referenced in the PR conversation (carbon-design-system/carbon#3283). This suggests either:
1. The CSS classes for the small variant weren't properly overriding the default button styles
2. The button component's base styles aren't properly handling size variants

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is a sizing discrepancy where the small ghost button renders at 36px height instead of the specified 32px height. This appears to be a CSS implementation issue where either the size variants aren't properly defined or the ghost button variant isn't correctly inheriting/applying the small size properties. The fix would likely involve adjusting the CSS height properties and potentially reviewing padding/margin values to ensure the small ghost button variant renders at exactly 32px height as per the design system specifications.
