Let me analyze the accessibility issues with the Content Switcher component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Insufficient contrast ratio for unselected tab outlines
**Cause**: The light grey outline/background used for unselected tabs has a contrast ratio of only 1.1:1 against the white background, falling well below the WCAG 2.1 requirement of 3:1 minimum contrast for UI components

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor visual binding between selected and unselected tabs
**Cause**: The lack of clear visual connection between tabs can make the selected tab appear as an isolated black button rather than part of a unified component, especially in 2-tab implementations

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Low contrast divider between unselected tabs
**Cause**: The divider line between unselected tabs fails to meet the 3:1 contrast requirement, though this may be less critical for component understanding compared to the tab outlines

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Component becomes unclear without proper visual treatment
**Cause**: When low contrast elements are removed without replacement, the component loses its identity as a unified control, demonstrating that some visual treatment meeting contrast requirements is necessary for component identification

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Content Switcher component has multiple accessibility issues primarily centered around insufficient contrast ratios that violate WCAG 1.4.11 requirements. The main problems are:
1. Too low contrast (1.1:1) for unselected tab outlines
2. Poor visual cohesion making the component appear fragmented
3. Low contrast dividers between tabs
4. Overall need for better visual treatment meeting minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

The issues can be addressed by:
- Implementing higher contrast outlines (at least 3:1)
- Adding clear visual binding between tabs
- Potentially increasing divider contrast
- Ensuring all visual elements required for component identification meet WCAG contrast requirements

These changes would make the component more accessible while maintaining its functionality and purpose.
