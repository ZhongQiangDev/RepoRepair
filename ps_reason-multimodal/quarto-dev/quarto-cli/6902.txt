Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Subfigures are labeled as normal figures (1, 2) instead of proper subfigure labels (a, b) when no explicit subfigure IDs are provided
**Cause**: When subfigure IDs are not explicitly specified, Quarto generates LaTeX code using regular \caption{} commands instead of \subcaption{}, treating each subfigure as an independent figure rather than a component of a compound figure

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent LaTeX code generation between labeled and unlabeled subfigures
**Cause**: Quarto's LaTeX code generation logic differs based on whether subfigure IDs are present:
- Without IDs: Uses standard \caption{} command
- With IDs: Uses \subcaption{} command with proper \label{} tags

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of automatic subfigure reference generation
**Cause**: Quarto doesn't automatically generate unique identifiers for subfigures when they're part of a compound figure, requiring manual ID specification to achieve proper subfigure labeling

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around Quarto's handling of subfigures in compound figures. Without explicit subfigure IDs, Quarto fails to generate proper subfigure labels and uses regular figure caption commands instead of subfigure-specific ones. This leads to incorrect numbering (1, 2 instead of a, b) and inconsistent LaTeX code generation. The problem could be resolved by implementing automatic subfigure ID generation and consistent use of \subcaption{} commands regardless of whether explicit IDs are provided.
