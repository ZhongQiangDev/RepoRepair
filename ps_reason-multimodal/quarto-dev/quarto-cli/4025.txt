Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: A single Bokeh plot is being incorrectly split into multiple subfigures (1b and 1c) in the output, when it should be displayed as a single figure.
**Cause**: This appears to be a rendering issue where Quarto's figure handling system is misinterpreting the Bokeh plot's HTML output structure. Bokeh plots are rendered using HTML and JavaScript, which can sometimes conflict with Quarto's figure numbering and layout system.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Empty subfigures (1b and 1c) are being generated unnecessarily
**Cause**: The `output_notebook()` function from Bokeh might be generating additional HTML elements or divs that Quarto is interpreting as separate figures, even though they're just part of Bokeh's rendering infrastructure.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Figure numbering is inconsistent with the actual content
**Cause**: The mismatch between Quarto's figure labeling system (`#| label: fig-demo`) and Bokeh's output format is causing the figure numbering system to malfunction, creating additional figure references that don't correspond to actual content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from compatibility challenges between Bokeh's HTML/JavaScript-based plotting system and Quarto's document processing pipeline. The main problems are:
1. Incorrect figure splitting
2. Generation of empty subfigures
3. Inconsistent figure numbering

The root cause appears to be how Quarto processes and interprets Bokeh's output structure, leading to a misidentification of HTML elements as separate figures when they should be treated as a single visualization unit. This is likely a technical integration issue that needs to be addressed in how Quarto handles Bokeh's output format.
