Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The RevealJS presentation shows a blank screen when using percentage values for width and height (e.g., "100%")
**Cause**: The percentage values are being quoted in the YAML configuration ("100%"), which appears to prevent RevealJS from properly interpreting these values. RevealJS expects percentage values to be unquoted.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The documentation suggests percentage values are supported, but the implementation doesn't work as documented
**Cause**: There appears to be a discrepancy between the Quarto documentation (which shows percentage values are supported) and the actual implementation/template generation. This could be a bug in how Quarto generates the RevealJS template when percentage values are quoted.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The presentation only works when using absolute pixel values (e.g., 1600, 900)
**Cause**: This indicates that the RevealJS configuration is properly processing numeric values but has specific handling requirements for percentage values that aren't being met when the values are quoted strings.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the quoting of percentage values in the YAML configuration. While the documentation suggests percentage values are supported, the actual implementation requires these values to be unquoted to work properly. The presentation works fine with absolute pixel values, suggesting that the problem is specifically related to how quoted percentage values are handled in the template generation process. The solution would be to either use unquoted percentage values or use absolute pixel values for the width and height parameters.

The most direct fix would be to modify the YAML to use unquoted percentage values:
```yaml
revealjs:
  theme: default
  width: 100%
  height: 100%
```
Instead of:
```yaml
revealjs:
  theme: default
  width: "100%"
  height: "100%"
```
