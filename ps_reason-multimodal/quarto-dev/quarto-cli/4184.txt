Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The combination of `.panel-tabset` and `.nav-fill` classes doesn't render correctly when `.nav-fill` is applied directly with `.panel-tabset` in Quarto 1.3.146 (prerelease version).
**Cause**: There appears to be a change in how nested CSS classes are handled in the newer Quarto version, causing the Bootstrap nav-fill utility class to not properly apply to the tabset elements when combined directly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual regression between Quarto versions - the tabs in version 1.3.146 appear narrower and don't fill the available space compared to version 1.2.335.
**Cause**: The CSS class inheritance or application order might have changed in the newer version, preventing the Bootstrap nav-fill styles from being properly applied to the tab navigation elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The original syntax (combining classes directly) no longer works, while nesting the classes in separate div blocks does work.
**Cause**: This suggests a change in how Quarto processes nested DIV structures and class combinations. The working solution (nesting `.panel-tabset` inside `.nav-fill`) indicates that the class hierarchy and DOM structure are now more strictly enforced in the newer version.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from changes in how Quarto 1.3.146 handles combined Bootstrap utility classes with panel-tabset components. The problem manifests as incorrect rendering of tab widths and spacing when using the `.nav-fill` class. While the direct combination of classes no longer works, nesting the classes in separate div blocks provides a working solution. This suggests a fundamental change in how Quarto processes and applies Bootstrap classes in the newer version, particularly affecting class inheritance and DOM structure handling.
