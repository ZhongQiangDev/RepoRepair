Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lua filter error occurs when using code blocks in theorems without proper header/label
**Cause**: The crossref.lua filter expects a table structure for theorem processing, but when the theorem content is not properly formatted with a complete header/label, it receives nil instead, causing the "bad argument #1 to 'insert'" error at line 97.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Theorem headings are incorrectly included as list items when using lists inside theorem divs
**Cause**: The markdown parser is not properly distinguishing between the theorem header (marked with ##) and the list content that follows it, causing the header to be interpreted as part of the list structure instead of being treated as a separate heading element.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Users are forced to fully specify theorems and proofs to make them work
**Cause**: The current implementation of the crossref.lua filter lacks proper fallback handling for partially specified theorem structures, making it strict about requiring complete theorem specifications including labels and headers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from three main problems in the Quarto theorem handling system:
1. The Lua crossref filter has rigid expectations about theorem structure and fails ungracefully when those expectations aren't met
2. There's improper parsing of markdown elements within theorem divs, particularly with list structures
3. The system lacks flexibility in handling partially specified theorem formats, forcing users to use full specifications even for simple cases

These issues appear to be related to the internal implementation of theorem handling in Quarto's crossref.lua filter and the markdown parsing logic, requiring fixes at both the filter level and the markdown processing level.
