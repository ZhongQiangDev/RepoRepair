Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Images with non-standard URLs (containing commas, special characters) don't display properly in the grid view, while they work fine inline in the blog post.
**Cause**: The grid view component likely doesn't properly encode or handle URLs with special characters (like commas in "w_1028,c_limit"). This suggests an URL encoding/parsing issue specific to the grid view implementation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between inline image display and grid view display for the same image URL
**Cause**: Different components (inline markdown renderer vs. grid view) appear to be using different methods for handling image URLs. The inline markdown renderer seems more robust in handling non-standard URLs compared to the grid view component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around URL handling inconsistencies in Quarto's different display contexts. While the markdown renderer properly handles non-standard URLs with special characters, the grid view component fails to properly process these same URLs. This suggests a need to:
1. Standardize URL handling across different components
2. Implement proper URL encoding in the grid view component
3. Ensure consistent image rendering behavior across all display contexts

The problem appears to be primarily a technical implementation issue rather than a content or configuration problem.
