Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Title slide content is misaligned/shifted to the left when using `hash-type: number` in RevealJS presentation
**Cause**: The `hash-type: number` setting appears to be interfering with the default CSS styling or layout properties of the title slide in RevealJS. This is evident from the comparison images where the content is properly centered with `hash-type: title` but shifts left with `hash-type: number`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between different hash-type settings
**Cause**: The RevealJS framework seems to handle the `title` and `number` hash types differently, suggesting there might be different CSS rules or layout calculations being applied based on the hash-type value. This indicates a potential bug in how RevealJS integrates with Quarto's title slide template when numerical slide references are used.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around layout problems in RevealJS presentations when using numerical slide references (`hash-type: number`). The problem manifests as misaligned content on the title slide, while using `hash-type: title` works correctly. This suggests an underlying issue with how RevealJS handles different hash types and their interaction with slide layout calculations. The bug appears to be specific to the title slide template and its CSS positioning when numerical hash types are enabled.

The issue seems to be a bug in either Quarto's RevealJS implementation or RevealJS itself, rather than user error, as it occurs with a minimal configuration and is reproducible on the specified system (Fedora 37).
