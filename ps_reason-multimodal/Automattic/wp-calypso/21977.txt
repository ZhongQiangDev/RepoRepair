Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing success feedback after Stripe Connect account creation
**Cause**: The system currently doesn't display a visual confirmation (green success banner) after successfully creating a Stripe Connect account, making it unclear to users whether the action was completed successfully.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent user experience across similar success scenarios
**Cause**: The application appears to use success banners in other parts of the system (as shown in the reference image), but not in this specific Stripe Connect flow, creating an inconsistent user experience pattern.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around missing user feedback in the form of a success banner after completing the Stripe Connect account creation process. This creates two problems: (1) lack of clear confirmation for users that their action was successful, and (2) inconsistency in the application's feedback patterns. The solution would be to implement the green success banner (as shown in the screenshot) to appear after successful Stripe Connect account creation, matching the existing UI patterns in other parts of the application. This would improve both user feedback and maintain consistency in the user interface.

The fix appears to be straightforward - adding the same green success banner component that's already being used elsewhere in the application, with appropriate messaging for the Stripe Connect success case.
