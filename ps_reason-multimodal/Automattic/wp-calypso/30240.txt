Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent input field widths across different signup steps
**Cause**: Lack of standardized CSS width specifications for input fields in the signup flow, leading to varying widths based on individual component styles or default browser rendering

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual inconsistency in the user interface
**Cause**: Absence of a design system or component library that enforces consistent dimensions for similar UI elements across the signup process

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Suboptimal user experience due to varying input sizes
**Cause**: Missing responsive design guidelines that would ensure uniform input field dimensions across different steps of the signup flow

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around inconsistent input field widths in the signup process. This stems from three primary causes: lack of standardized CSS width specifications, absence of a unified design system, and missing responsive design guidelines. The proposed solution to standardize all input widths to match the 'site-topic' input width would create a more cohesive and professional user interface. This would improve both the visual consistency and user experience of the signup flow.
