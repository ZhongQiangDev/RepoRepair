Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Only site Administrators can purchase plans, with no ability to transfer ownership
**Cause**: The current system architecture restricts plan ownership to the original purchasing Administrator, likely due to billing system limitations and security considerations

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Plan management and cancellation capabilities are locked to the original purchaser
**Cause**: The billing system ties plan management rights strictly to the purchasing account, without flexibility for delegation or transfer of these rights

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Billing details are permanently associated with the original purchaser
**Cause**: The billing system architecture doesn't separate plan ownership from payment information, making it difficult to transfer financial responsibilities

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of transparency and notification system for plan ownership changes
**Cause**: The current system doesn't have built-in mechanisms for tracking and communicating ownership transfers between administrators

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: No UI element to facilitate plan ownership transfer
**Cause**: The existing interface wasn't designed with ownership transfer functionality in mind, resulting in non-clickable owner information and no transfer workflow

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from an inflexible billing system architecture that tightly couples plan ownership, billing information, and management rights to a single administrator account. This creates problems with ownership transfer, plan management delegation, and transparency of ownership changes. The proposed solution suggests implementing a new UI workflow for ownership transfer, but this would require significant backend changes to the billing system to support separation of these concerns and proper handling of ownership transfers between administrators.
