Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the wrong behaviors and their likely causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Products cannot be saved when the category name contains an ampersand ("&") character
**Cause**: This is likely due to improper URL encoding/escaping of special characters in the category name when making API requests through the WordPress.com store interface. The ampersand is a special character in URLs and needs proper encoding to be handled correctly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between first product save and subsequent product saves
**Cause**: The different behavior between first and subsequent saves suggests there may be a caching issue or state management problem in how category data is handled after initial creation. The first save might use a different code path than subsequent saves.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Discrepancy between WP-Admin and WordPress.com store interface functionality
**Cause**: Since the issue only occurs in the WordPress.com store interface but not in WP-Admin, this indicates the problem is specific to the store interface's implementation of product creation. WP-Admin likely uses different API endpoints or has proper character encoding in place.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be improper handling of special characters (specifically the ampersand) in category names when creating products through the WordPress.com store interface. This manifests in three ways: direct failure to save products with "&" in categories, inconsistent behavior between first and subsequent saves, and different behavior between interfaces. The primary technical cause is likely related to character encoding/escaping in API requests, with possible secondary issues in state management and caching. The fact that WP-Admin works correctly provides a reference point for proper implementation.
