Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the provided GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Users can proceed through the signup flow without verifying their email address
**Cause**: The current implementation only shows a notification prompt for email verification but doesn't enforce it as a requirement before proceeding

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Authentication issues for users from non-supported countries when accessing wp-admin
**Cause**: WPCOM session validation requires email verification, but the current flow doesn't ensure this is completed before users reach the wp-admin stage

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of differentiated user flows based on country support
**Cause**: The system currently uses the same flow for both supported (US, CA) and non-supported countries, without implementing necessary verification checkpoints for non-supported regions

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: No mechanism to confirm email verification completion
**Cause**: Missing functionality to either poll for verification status or allow users to manually confirm they've completed the verification process

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Unclear user guidance for email verification process
**Cause**: The current notification system doesn't effectively communicate the importance of email verification or provide clear visual guidance about the verification process

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues revolve around insufficient email verification enforcement in the signup flow, particularly critical for users from non-supported countries. The system needs to implement mandatory email verification checkpoints, different user flows based on country support status, and better user guidance through the verification process. The main technical improvements needed are implementing the isCurrentUserEmailVerified check, adding verification status polling, and creating a new verification step after the address page that branches based on country support status.
