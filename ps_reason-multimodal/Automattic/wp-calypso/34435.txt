Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Unexpected account details screen flash appears after plan selection
**Cause**: The signup flow appears to be showing an intermediate account creation confirmation screen that should be hidden or handled seamlessly in the background. This suggests there's a timing/state management issue where the account creation confirmation is briefly visible before the automatic progression to the next step.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Disrupted user flow experience
**Cause**: The current implementation seems to be creating the user account before completing the entire signup flow, then showing this status to the user, which breaks the expected smooth progression of the signup process. This indicates a potential architectural issue in how the signup steps are ordered and managed.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Unnecessary user notification
**Cause**: The system is displaying a notification about account creation that provides no immediate value to the user and potentially causes confusion since they can't take any action on it before being automatically redirected.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a UX flow problem where the signup process is exposing internal state changes (account creation) to the user unnecessarily. The main causes are:
1. Poor state management during the signup flow
2. Incorrect timing of account creation notification
3. Suboptimal architecture where account creation feedback is visible when it should be hidden

The solution would likely involve restructuring the signup flow to handle account creation silently in the background while maintaining a seamless transition between selecting a plan and reaching either the checklist view (free plan) or checkout (paid plan).
