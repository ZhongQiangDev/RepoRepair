Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Edit button appears in the Reader feed for Jetpack sites when it shouldn't be functional
**Cause**: The Reader interface is likely not properly checking whether the edit functionality is supported for Jetpack sites before displaying the edit button

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Clicking the Edit link causes the UI to break (top and side bars disappear)
**Cause**: The navigation/routing system is likely conflicting between Reader mode and Editor mode, causing a partial state transition that breaks the UI layout

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Editor mode fails to fully initialize after clicking Edit
**Cause**: The system appears to be failing to properly transition from Reader to Editor mode, possibly due to:
- Incomplete authentication handling for Jetpack sites
- Missing proper redirect logic to the correct editor URL
- Incompatible state management between Reader and Editor components

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be improper handling of edit functionality for Jetpack sites in the WordPress.com Reader. There are three main problems:
1. The Edit button is incorrectly displayed when it shouldn't be
2. The UI breaks when attempting to transition between Reader and Editor
3. The Editor fails to properly initialize

The root cause seems to be a combination of improper state management, routing issues, and lack of proper checks for Jetpack site compatibility in the Reader interface. This suggests the need for better integration between the Reader and Editor systems, especially when dealing with Jetpack sites.
