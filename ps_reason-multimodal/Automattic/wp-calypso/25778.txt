Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple error notices appearing repeatedly on the screen
**Cause**: The system keeps retrying to load comments after receiving a 403 error, and each failed attempt generates a new error notice without any limit to the retry attempts

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor error handling for inaccessible comments
**Cause**: When the JSON API is turned off, the system doesn't gracefully handle the 403 response from the replies endpoint, instead displaying technical error notices to users rather than a user-friendly message in the comments section

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: System attempting to load comments when it shouldn't
**Cause**: The API response doesn't indicate that comments are disabled when the Jetpack JSON API is turned off for a site, leading the system to unnecessarily attempt loading comments

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The problem stems from three main issues: unlimited retry attempts causing multiple error notices, poor error handling that shows technical messages instead of user-friendly ones, and a lack of proper API response configuration for sites with disabled JSON API. The core issue appears to be the system's inability to properly handle cases where the Jetpack JSON API is turned off, leading to a cascade of user-facing problems. A comprehensive solution would involve implementing retry limits, improving error handling, and updating the API response to properly indicate comment availability based on the JSON API status.
