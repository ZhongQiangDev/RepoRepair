Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from this Jetpack Connect issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect page display - showing site entry screen instead of plans page
**Cause**: There appears to be a mismatch between the URL routing (/jetpack/connect/plans) and the actual component being rendered. The system is likely not properly maintaining or checking the connection state for non-admin users.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Redirect loop in the URL bar
**Cause**: The authentication/authorization flow seems to be stuck in a cycle, possibly due to:
- Improper handling of user roles and permissions
- Session state not being properly maintained between redirects
- Confusion between WordPress.com and self-hosted site authentication states

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect final destination - not redirecting back to wp-admin
**Cause**: The connection flow doesn't properly handle the post-connection redirect path for non-admin users. This could be because:
- The redirect logic might only be configured for admin-level users
- The system may not be properly checking user roles before deciding the redirect destination

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be improper handling of non-admin user flows in Jetpack Connect. The system:
1. Fails to properly route users to the correct page after connection
2. Creates redirect loops due to authentication state issues
3. Doesn't properly handle post-connection redirects for different user roles

The root cause seems to be that the Jetpack Connect flow was primarily designed with admin users in mind, and doesn't properly account for different user role scenarios. This results in incorrect page rendering, authentication issues, and improper redirects when non-admin users attempt to use the connection flow.
