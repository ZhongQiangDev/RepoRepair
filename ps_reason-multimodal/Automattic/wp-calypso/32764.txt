Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Upcoming charges section appears to be awkwardly placed in the current UI layout
**Cause**: Poor information architecture - related billing information is scattered across different sections rather than being logically grouped together

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Reduced user experience in finding and understanding future billing information
**Cause**: The current placement doesn't follow natural user expectations of finding billing-related information in a dedicated or logically related section (like Pending Payments)

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential confusion between current charges, pending payments, and upcoming charges
**Cause**: Lack of clear separation and organization between different types of billing information, making it harder for users to distinguish between current, pending, and future charges

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around poor UI/UX design in the billing section, specifically regarding the placement of upcoming charges. The current implementation appears to be an afterthought rather than a well-planned feature. The causes stem from suboptimal information architecture that doesn't group related billing information together logically. Moving the upcoming charges to either a dedicated tab or combining it with Pending Payments would create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, making it easier for users to find and understand their billing information.
