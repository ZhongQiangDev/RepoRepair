Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of custom styling on the login page after switching between signup and login forms and reloading
**Cause**: The client ID parameter is not being preserved when navigating between the signup and login forms. When the page is reloaded, the system cannot identify which OAuth client the request came from, resulting in the default WordPress.com styling being displayed instead of the client-specific styling.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent user experience between initial login page and the page shown after form switching
**Cause**: The navigation between login and signup forms is not properly maintaining the OAuth context (client_id and other OAuth-related parameters). This causes the system to fall back to the standard WordPress.com authentication flow instead of maintaining the WooCommerce-specific OAuth flow.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of OAuth flow context during form switching
**Cause**: The links between login and signup forms are not properly configured to carry over all necessary OAuth parameters (particularly the client_id) in their URLs. This breaks the OAuth authentication chain and causes the system to lose track of which client initiated the authentication process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper parameter handling during form navigation in the OAuth flow. When users switch between signup and login forms, the OAuth context (specifically the client_id) is lost, causing three main problems: loss of custom styling, inconsistent user experience, and broken OAuth flow. The solution would likely involve ensuring that all navigation links between forms preserve the necessary OAuth parameters, particularly the client_id, to maintain the proper authentication context throughout the entire user journey.
