Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the provided GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Contact form fails to load and shows infinite "Loading contact form" messages
**Cause**: The application is trying to access the ID property of a null object because there is no primary site selected. This happens after deleting the primary site, leaving the system in an invalid state without proper error handling.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No graceful error handling or user feedback
**Cause**: The application doesn't have proper validation or fallback mechanisms to handle cases where a primary site doesn't exist. Instead of showing a meaningful error message or site picker to the user, it silently fails.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Console shows TypeError exceptions
**Cause**: The code assumes that a site object will always exist and tries to access its ID property without first checking if the object exists. This is evident from the error message "Cannot read property 'ID' of null" in the stack trace.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Deprecated code warnings in console
**Cause**: The application is using deprecated features, specifically related to moment construction and XMLHttpRequest. This indicates that some of the codebase needs to be updated to use more current approaches.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from poor handling of the "no primary site" scenario in the contact form implementation. The application needs:
1. Proper null checking before accessing site properties
2. Graceful error handling with user feedback
3. A fallback mechanism (like a site picker) when no primary site exists
4. Code updates to remove usage of deprecated features

The most critical fix would be implementing proper validation and error handling to manage cases where a primary site doesn't exist, rather than allowing the application to break silently.
