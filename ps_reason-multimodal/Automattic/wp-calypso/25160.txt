Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Featured image from Google Library is not being displayed in the preview after selection
**Cause**: There appears to be a synchronization issue between Google Library integration and WordPress's featured image system, where the selected image is not being properly transferred or saved to WordPress's media system.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: System shows "unsaved changes" warning when trying to leave the page, even after publishing
**Cause**: The featured image selection process is likely triggering a change event that's not being properly cleared after publishing, causing WordPress to think there are still pending changes to be saved.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Featured image needs to be added again to get applied
**Cause**: The initial featured image selection process is failing to properly bind the image to the post in WordPress's database, suggesting a potential issue with the image upload/attachment process or data persistence.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a broken integration between Google Library and WordPress's featured image system. This manifests in three main ways: failure to display selected images, persistent "unsaved changes" warnings, and the need to re-add images. The root cause likely stems from either:
1. Incomplete/failed image data transfer from Google Library to WordPress
2. Issues with the WordPress media handling system for external images
3. Problems with the state management during the featured image selection process

This is a cross-theme issue, suggesting it's related to core WordPress functionality rather than theme-specific implementation.
