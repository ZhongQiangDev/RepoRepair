From the GitHub problem description, this appears to be more of a feature request/enhancement rather than a bug fix. However, I'll analyze the "wrong behaviors" that led to this request:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: App download nudge was removed from the Checklist feature
**Cause**: The team determined that app downloads were more appropriate as a post-launch onboarding task rather than a site setup task

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No alternative placement for the app download prompt after removal from Checklist
**Cause**: When the feature was removed from the Checklist, there wasn't an immediate alternative implementation for encouraging mobile app adoption

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of app promotion during key user engagement moments
**Cause**: The current user journey doesn't capitalize on the positive momentum of completing the Checklist tasks to promote additional platform features (like the mobile app)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the removal of the app download nudge from the Checklist feature without having an immediate alternative placement. The team recognized that while promoting the mobile app is important, it fits better in the post-launch flow rather than during initial site setup. The proposed solution is to add the app download prompt to the "congratulations" screen that appears after completing all Checklist tasks, which provides a more appropriate timing for this type of promotion while maintaining the streamlined nature of the site setup process.
