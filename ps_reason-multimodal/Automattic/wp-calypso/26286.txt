Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: App banner is incorrectly showing up on the Stats Activity Log page on mobile devices
**Cause**: The current Redux state implementation only checks for the `/stats` path without distinguishing between different sub-sections of the stats page (like `/stats/activity`). This overly broad path matching causes the banner to appear in places where it shouldn't.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of granular path detection in the app banner logic
**Cause**: As shown in the code reference (wp-calypso/client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx#L149), the implementation only looks for `/stats` in the path matching logic, without considering deeper path structures or sub-routes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Insufficient Redux state information for path discrimination
**Cause**: The Redux state doesn't contain enough detailed information about the current path being visited, making it impossible to properly filter out specific sub-sections of the stats page where the banner shouldn't appear.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from three interconnected problems: inappropriate banner display on the Activity Log page, oversimplified path matching logic, and insufficient path information in the Redux state. The main technical cause is the basic `/stats` path matching without proper sub-path handling, combined with a Redux state that doesn't provide enough granular information about the current path. To fix this, the implementation needs to be updated to handle more specific path patterns and the Redux state needs to be enhanced to store more detailed path information.
