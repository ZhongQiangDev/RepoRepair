Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Text widow appears in the "Priority support" card where "account." appears alone on the last line
**Cause**: The text wrapping behavior is not properly controlled, allowing single words to be isolated on the last line. The current implementation of `preventWidows()` is not working because of the `<strong />` component breaking up the text content.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: `preventWidows()` function not working as expected when applied to `this.getSupportText()`
**Cause**: The presence of the `<strong />` component in the text content interferes with the widow prevention logic, as it splits the text into separate DOM elements rather than treating it as a single text string.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around typography and text wrapping control in the Happiness Support card. The core problem is that the text widow prevention mechanism (`preventWidows()`) is incompatible with text that contains HTML elements like `<strong />`. This creates an undesirable visual presentation where single words can appear isolated on the last line. A solution would need to account for both the widow prevention and the presence of HTML elements in the text content.
