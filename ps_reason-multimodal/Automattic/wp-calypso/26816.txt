Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Modal dismissal state is not persisted
**Cause**: User preferences are not being saved to remember if a user has dismissed the modal, causing it to show up again on every load

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect handling of Jetpack/AT sites
**Cause**: The system currently doesn't have logic to redirect Jetpack/AT sites to wp-admin, which needs to be implemented as mentioned in the todo list

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Modal visibility on initial load is not properly managed
**Cause**: There's no default visibility state setting for the modal when the page loads for the first time

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Sidebar image is not interactive
**Cause**: The sidebar image was initially implemented as a static element without click functionality (though this has been marked as resolved with a checkmark)

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential user annoyance from repeated modal displays
**Cause**: Lack of a "Don't show again" option, which was raised as a bonus design question but could be important for user experience

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around state management and user preferences. The modal's persistence, visibility, and interaction states need better handling, particularly for:
1. Saving user dismissal preferences
2. Managing different site types (Jetpack/AT)
3. Controlling initial load visibility
4. Improving user control over modal displays
5. Enhancing interactive elements

Most of these issues appear to be related to user experience improvements rather than critical functional bugs, with the main focus being on making the modal behavior more user-friendly and persistent across sessions.
