Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The chart shows nothing/is blank when data contains negative values
**Cause**: The DataChart component appears to have an issue handling negative values in its rendering logic. Based on the screenshots, when negative values are present in the dataset, the chart's rendering mechanism fails completely instead of properly scaling and displaying bars that extend below the zero line.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing zero line guide for negative values
**Cause**: The DataChart component seems to lack proper implementation of axis scaling and reference line rendering when the data range includes negative values. The zero line guide, which should be automatically displayed when negative values are present, is not being generated.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to customize negative value attributes
**Cause**: The component appears to lack configuration options specifically for styling negative values differently from positive values. This limitation in the API prevents users from applying custom styling (like different colors) to negative value bars.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Grommet DataChart component has three main issues when handling negative values: complete failure to render any bars when negative values are present, missing zero line reference for negative value contexts, and lack of customization options for negative value styling. These issues appear to stem from incomplete implementation of negative value support in the component's core rendering logic and configuration options. The problems affect both the basic functionality (rendering) and advanced features (customization) of the chart component.
