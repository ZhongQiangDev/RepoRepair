Let me analyze the GitHub issue description and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Form remains invalid after removing a required field
**Cause**: The form validation state is not being properly reset or re-evaluated when fields are dynamically removed. The validation logic appears to be retaining the invalid state of the removed field even after it's no longer part of the form.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent validation behavior between adding and removing fields
**Cause**: The form validation handler (onValidate) likely doesn't have proper cleanup logic when fields are removed. While it correctly validates newly added fields, it doesn't properly handle the removal of fields from the validation context.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Form state doesn't update immediately after toggling fields
**Cause**: The form's validation state management might not be properly synchronized with the component's lifecycle methods. When the checkbox triggers the removal of a field, the form's internal validation state isn't being updated in the same render cycle.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around improper handling of dynamic form validation states in Grommet's Form component. The main problems stem from:
1. Lack of proper cleanup for removed field validations
2. Asynchronous state updates not being handled correctly
3. Form validation context not being properly reset when the form structure changes

The issue appears to be a bug in how Grommet handles dynamic form field validation, particularly when removing required fields. This matches with the referenced GitHub issue (#4743), suggesting it's a persistent problem in the framework's form handling mechanism.
