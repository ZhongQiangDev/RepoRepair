Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The list action is misaligned when the `onOrder` property is present
**Cause**: There appears to be a CSS layout conflict between the `action` and `onOrder` properties in the List component. When both properties are used together, the layout system likely fails to properly align the action items with the rest of the list content.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The list layout becomes inconsistent when combining `action` and `onOrder` properties
**Cause**: The component's internal grid or flexbox layout system may not be properly handling the additional column space needed for both the ordering functionality and action items simultaneously. This suggests a potential issue with the CSS grid/flexbox implementation in the List component.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual regression when using multiple List component features together
**Cause**: The component may not have been designed or tested for the specific combination of `action` and `onOrder` properties, leading to unhandled edge cases in the layout logic.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from layout compatibility problems between the List component's `action` and `onOrder` properties. The root cause appears to be related to CSS layout conflicts and potentially incomplete handling of multiple feature combinations in the component's design. This results in misalignment and inconsistent spacing when both properties are used together. The issue seems to be a bug in the Grommet library's List component implementation rather than a user error or environment-specific problem.
