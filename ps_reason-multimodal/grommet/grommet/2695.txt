Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Jerky/non-smooth animation of the circle meter path when value changes
**Cause**: The use of "transition: all" with 300ms duration is too broad and affects all properties of the SVG path, including those that shouldn't be animated. This causes the browser to try to animate properties that should remain static, resulting in visual artifacts.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No animation in Firefox and Safari
**Cause**: Different browsers have varying implementations of SVG path animations. The current transition approach isn't compatible with Firefox and Safari's SVG rendering engines, causing the animation to fail completely in these browsers.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Path deformation during transition
**Cause**: The SVG path's stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties are being animated simultaneously with other properties, causing temporary path deformation during the transition period. These properties should be animated separately or with more specific transition rules.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from improper SVG path animation implementation. The current "transition: all" approach is too broad and causes three major problems: jerky animations in Chrome, no animations in Firefox/Safari, and path deformation during transitions. The solution would likely involve:
1. Using more specific transition properties instead of "transition: all"
2. Implementing browser-specific fixes for cross-browser compatibility
3. Properly handling SVG path properties during animations to prevent deformation

A more targeted approach to animating only the necessary properties (like stroke-dashoffset) would likely resolve these issues.
