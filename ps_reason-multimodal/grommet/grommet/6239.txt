Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Tab underlines are not sticking to the bottom of the tab content area when there is scrollable content
**Cause**: This appears to be caused by changes introduced in Grommet version 2.25.0 through PR #6137. The update likely modified how tab containers handle fixed heights and scrolling behavior, causing the underline styling to lose its "sticky" positioning relative to the tab content.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual inconsistency between versions 2.24.0 and 2.25.0
**Cause**: The styling regression appears to be a side effect of changes in the CSS layout model between versions. While version 2.24.0 maintained proper underline positioning, the new feature implementation in 2.25.0 likely changed the container's layout structure or positioning context, affecting how the underline elements are anchored.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Scrollable content affecting tab underline positioning
**Cause**: The fixed height container combined with scrollable content is not properly maintaining the underline's position. This suggests the CSS positioning or overflow handling was modified in a way that breaks the expected behavior of keeping the underline visible and properly positioned when content scrolls.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from changes introduced in Grommet 2.25.0 that affected how tab underlines are positioned within fixed-height containers containing scrollable content. The regression appears to be an unintended consequence of PR #6137, which modified the component's layout behavior. The problem manifests as underlines not maintaining their expected position at the bottom of tabs, particularly when content is scrollable. This affects the visual consistency and usability of the tab interface compared to the previous working version (2.24.0).

The fix would likely require revisiting the changes introduced in PR #6137 and ensuring that tab underline positioning is preserved while maintaining the new features or improvements that were added.
