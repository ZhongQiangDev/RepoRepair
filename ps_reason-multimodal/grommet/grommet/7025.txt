Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing 'Clear Filters' button in the Data Toolbar interface
**Cause**: Based on the screenshots and description, the 'Clear Filters' control appears to have been incorrectly implemented as a top-level component instead of being embedded within the Data component as specified in the design system documentation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency with HPE Design System specifications
**Cause**: The implementation deviates from the official HPE Design System examples (both "Filtering With Select" and "Filtering With Layer" patterns), where the Clear Filters button should be automatically displayed when filter interactions occur.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Broken user interaction feedback
**Cause**: The system is not properly responding to user interactions with Data Toolbar components (Filter, Search, etc.) by failing to display the Clear Filters option when filters are active.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from an architectural implementation problem where the Clear Filters functionality was incorrectly positioned in the component hierarchy. Instead of being embedded within the Data component where it can properly respond to filtering states, it was implemented as a top-level component. This caused three main issues: missing Clear Filters button, deviation from design system specifications, and broken interaction feedback. To fix this, the Clear Filters control should be refactored to be part of the Data component's internal structure, following the HPE Design System patterns.
