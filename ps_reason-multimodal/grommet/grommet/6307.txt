Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sorting arrow icons in the table header don't update when using browser navigation (back/forward buttons)
**Cause**: The DataTable component likely isn't listening to or responding to URL/history changes. When browser navigation occurs, it updates the URL but the component isn't re-rendering or updating its internal sorting state based on the new URL parameters.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The table's visual state becomes inconsistent with the URL parameters during navigation
**Cause**: There's probably a missing connection between the URL state management and the component's internal state. The component might be using local state for sorting indicators without synchronizing it with the URL parameters when they change via browser navigation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The sorting functionality works correctly for direct clicks but fails for browser navigation
**Cause**: The event handling is likely implemented only for direct user interactions (clicks) but doesn't account for programmatic changes to the sorting parameters via URL updates. This suggests a one-way binding where the component updates the URL but doesn't react to URL changes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete state management between the URL parameters and the DataTable component. While the component successfully handles direct user interactions and updates the URL, it fails to maintain bidirectional synchronization when the URL changes through browser navigation. This creates a disconnect between the visual state (sorting arrows) and the actual sorting parameters stored in the URL. The solution would likely involve implementing proper URL parameter monitoring and ensuring the component re-renders with updated sorting indicators when the URL changes, possibly using a URL parameter hook or router state management.
