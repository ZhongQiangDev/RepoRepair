Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Runtime TypeError when using both border="between" and gap="10px" properties
**Cause**: The Box component appears to have an implementation issue where it's trying to call .match() on an undefined value when processing the gap property with pixel units alongside the border="between" setting. This suggests the component's internal logic for handling pixel-based gap values with borders isn't properly implemented.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Failure to apply the expected spacing around separator lines
**Cause**: The Box component is unable to properly calculate and apply the half-gap spacing around separators when the gap value is specified in pixels, indicating a potential unit conversion or calculation issue in the component's layout logic.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between documentation and implementation
**Cause**: While the documentation states that both border="between" and gap with pixel values are valid properties, the actual implementation doesn't properly support this combination, suggesting a gap between the documented API and its implementation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from a fundamental implementation bug in the Grommet Box component where it fails to properly handle pixel-based gap values when used with border="between". This manifests as a runtime TypeError, prevents proper spacing calculation, and reveals an inconsistency between documentation and actual implementation. The issue appears to be consistent across different browsers and operating systems, indicating it's a core component issue rather than a platform-specific problem. This needs to be addressed at the component implementation level to properly handle pixel-based gap values alongside border settings.
