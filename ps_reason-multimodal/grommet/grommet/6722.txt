Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Vertical misalignment between the label ("File log level") and the Select component
**Cause**: The default styling of NameValuePair component doesn't provide proper vertical alignment settings. The valueProps prop with `align: "start"` only handles horizontal alignment, not vertical centering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent baseline alignment between text and form control
**Cause**: HTML form controls (like Select) and text elements naturally have different default vertical alignments. The Select component likely has default margins or padding that affect its positioning relative to the text label.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Layout structure doesn't enforce consistent vertical centering
**Cause**: The NameValueList and NameValuePair components might not have the necessary CSS flexbox or grid properties to ensure vertical center alignment of their children elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper vertical alignment configuration in the Grommet components. The problems are caused by:
1. Limited alignment control through valueProps
2. Default HTML element behaviors causing inconsistent baselines
3. Insufficient layout structure properties for vertical centering

To fix these issues, the solution would likely involve either:
- Adding vertical alignment properties to valueProps
- Implementing custom CSS to override default element behaviors
- Modifying the NameValuePair component to use flexbox or grid with vertical centering
