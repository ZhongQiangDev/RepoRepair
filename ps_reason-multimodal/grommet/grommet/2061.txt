Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The search input field appears very small/narrow in Safari browser
**Cause**: Safari has different default styling for search input fields compared to other browsers. Without the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` CSS property (which was present in v1 but missing in v2), Safari applies its own default search input styling which results in a smaller input field.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Padding is ignored in Safari browser
**Cause**: Safari's default search input styling overrides the custom padding settings. This is another side effect of Safari's unique handling of search input fields when `-webkit-appearance` property is not properly set.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent rendering between Safari and Chrome browsers
**Cause**: Browser-specific default styles and rendering behaviors, particularly Safari's unique treatment of search inputs. Chrome follows the standard input field styling while Safari applies its own search input conventions without the necessary webkit-specific CSS properties.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from Safari's unique handling of search input fields, which differs from other browsers like Chrome. The removal of `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` CSS property in v2 leads to three related problems: small input size, ignored padding, and inconsistent cross-browser rendering. All these issues were previously addressed in v1 through the webkit-specific CSS property, suggesting that reintroducing this property or implementing equivalent styling solutions would resolve the problems.
