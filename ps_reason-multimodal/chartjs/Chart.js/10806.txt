Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Initial circle border appears when hovering over a pie chart segment when the data array contains a value of 385 while other values are 0.
**Cause**: This appears to be a specific edge case in the chart.js rendering logic where the hoverOffset property doesn't properly handle the circle segment calculations when there's a single non-zero value of exactly 385 in the dataset. This suggests there might be a mathematical rounding or boundary condition issue in the hover animation calculations.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only manifests with the specific value of 385, indicating inconsistent behavior across different data values.
**Cause**: This is likely due to internal calculations in chart.js that might involve division, multiplication, or angle calculations that produce edge cases or floating-point precision errors specifically when dealing with the number 385 in combination with the hover animation offset.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The hover animation doesn't smoothly transition when the specific data configuration is present.
**Cause**: The hoverOffset property's implementation might not properly handle cases where there's an extreme disparity between values (385 vs 0), leading to incorrect segment expansion calculations during the hover state.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a specific edge case in chart.js's pie chart rendering logic when handling the hoverOffset property with a particular data configuration ([0,0,385,0]). The problem manifests as visual artifacts (showing the initial circle border) during hover states. The causes point to potential mathematical precision issues or boundary conditions in the hover animation calculations, specifically when dealing with the value 385 alongside zero values. This suggests the need for more robust handling of edge cases in the chart.js pie chart hover animation logic.
