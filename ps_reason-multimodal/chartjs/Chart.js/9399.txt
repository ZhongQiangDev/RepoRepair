Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Gaps/empty spaces appearing between bars in the chart
**Cause**: The default behavior of Chart.js bar charts includes padding between bars for visual separation. Even when setting categoryPercentage and barPercentage to 1, there may still be some internal padding calculations that prevent true 100% width.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent spacing between bars
**Cause**: This could be due to:
1. Rounding issues in Chart.js's internal calculations when trying to divide the available space
2. The way Chart.js handles pixel alignment for different screen resolutions
3. Potential conflicts between categoryPercentage and barPercentage settings

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Not matching the histogram style of the reference image
**Cause**: Chart.js's bar chart component is designed primarily for bar charts rather than histograms. While they look similar, histograms have specific requirements like:
1. No gaps between bars
2. Continuous data representation
3. Different internal calculations for bin sizes and data distribution

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from Chart.js's default bar chart implementation not being optimized for histogram-style visualization. The problems manifest as unwanted gaps between bars and inconsistent spacing, caused by:
1. Built-in padding calculations
2. Pixel alignment and rounding issues
3. The fundamental difference between bar chart and histogram implementations
4. Possible limitations in how Chart.js handles categoryPercentage and barPercentage properties

To achieve the desired histogram look, it might require either custom modifications to Chart.js's rendering or considering alternative charting libraries specifically designed for histograms.
