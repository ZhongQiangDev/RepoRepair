Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Y-axis labels are overlapping in Chart.js version 2.9.3
**Cause**: The automatic scale calculation algorithm in v2.9.3 appears to have changed from v2.7.3, causing the y-axis tick values to be generated with insufficient spacing between them. This is likely due to modifications in the auto-scaling logic that doesn't properly account for label height and density.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent label distribution compared to previous version
**Cause**: The step size calculation between versions has changed, where v2.9.3 is generating more tick points than v2.7.3. This suggests a modification in the internal stepSize algorithm that's not properly considering the available vertical space for label rendering.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor readability of y-axis values
**Cause**: The lack of proper spacing optimization in the newer version fails to implement adequate label collision detection and prevention. This is likely related to changes in the default configuration for axis label management between versions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from changes in Chart.js's auto-scaling and label management algorithms between versions 2.7.3 and 2.9.3. The problem manifests in three interconnected ways: overlapping labels, inconsistent distribution, and poor readability. The root cause appears to be modifications in how the library calculates step sizes and manages label spacing, without proper consideration for label collision prevention. This suggests either a regression in the auto-scaling functionality or unintended consequences from other optimization changes between these versions.

A potential fix would likely involve either:
1. Adjusting the chart's scale configuration
2. Manually setting the step size
3. Implementing custom label formatting
4. Rolling back to version 2.7.3 if the issue is critical and no immediate solution is available
