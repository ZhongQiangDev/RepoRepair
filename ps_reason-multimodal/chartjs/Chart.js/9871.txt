Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The tooltip only appears on a very narrow area (1-2 pixels) at the leading edge of the circle
**Cause**: The hit detection area for the single segment PolarArea chart appears to be incorrectly calculated, only registering the starting point of the arc rather than the entire filled area. This is likely due to how the chart.js library handles hit detection for polar area segments when there's only one data point that fills 360 degrees.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The chart segment is not clickable across the entire colored area
**Cause**: Similar to the tooltip issue, the event handling for click interactions is only being registered on the starting edge of the arc. This suggests the hit testing algorithm in Chart.js isn't properly handling the special case of a single segment that forms a complete circle (360 degrees).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user interaction functionality is effectively lost when using a single data point
**Cause**: The chart.js library seems to have an edge case handling issue specifically for PolarArea charts with single elements. The standard interaction handlers that work well for multiple segments aren't properly adapted for the case where one segment fills the entire circle, leading to poor user experience.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Chart.js's handling of single-segment PolarArea charts, where both tooltip and click interaction detection are improperly implemented. The hit detection area is incorrectly limited to just the starting point of the arc instead of the entire filled area. This appears to be a specific edge case that wasn't properly accounted for in the library's interaction handling logic for PolarArea charts. All these issues make the chart practically unusable for single data point scenarios, as users cannot effectively interact with the visualization to get additional information.
