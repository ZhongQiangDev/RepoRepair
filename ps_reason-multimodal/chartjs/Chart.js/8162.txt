Let me analyze the GitHub issue and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Legend and title are being rendered twice in Chart.js v3.0.0-beta.7 specifically for Pie charts
**Cause**: This appears to be a regression issue in beta.7 version, likely related to the chart's rendering lifecycle. The initial render works correctly, but a subsequent redraw is triggered unnecessarily, causing duplicate elements.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is specific to Pie charts and doesn't occur with Line charts
**Cause**: This suggests the problem is related to the specific rendering logic for Pie charts in v3.0.0-beta.7. The different behavior between chart types points to an issue in the Pie chart's specific implementation or plugin handling.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The duplicate rendering happens after the initial correct render
**Cause**: This timing-related behavior suggests either:
1. A double initialization of plugins
2. An incorrect event triggering a redraw
3. A problem with the chart update/refresh cycle specific to this beta version

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a bug in Chart.js v3.0.0-beta.7 that causes duplicate rendering of legends and titles specifically for Pie charts. The problem manifests as a secondary render occurring after the initial correct render, suggesting an issue with either the chart's rendering lifecycle, plugin initialization, or event handling specific to Pie charts. The fact that this doesn't occur in previous versions or with Line charts narrows down the probable cause to changes in the Pie chart implementation or plugin handling system introduced in this beta version.

This is likely a regression bug that needs to be addressed in the Chart.js codebase, particularly in the areas handling Pie chart rendering and plugin lifecycle management.
