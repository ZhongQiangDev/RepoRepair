Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Bubble completely disappears when hover radius is set to 0
**Cause**: This appears to be a bug in Chart.js's hover radius calculation logic. When hover radius is set to 0, instead of maintaining the original radius, the rendering engine is likely treating it as a signal to remove the bubble's visibility entirely during hover state.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Bubble size increases when hover radius equals the original radius
**Cause**: The hover radius is being implemented as an additive value rather than an absolute value. The documentation states hover radius should be "additional" radius, but this implementation appears to be doubling the effective radius (original radius + hover radius) even when they're set to the same value, leading to unexpected size increases.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The hover radius functionality in Chart.js 3.5.1 has two main issues:
1. Setting hover radius to 0 causes complete disappearance instead of maintaining original size
2. Setting hover radius equal to original radius causes unwanted size increase due to additive implementation

Both issues stem from how the hover radius calculation is implemented in the library's core rendering logic. While the documentation correctly describes hover radius as an additional value, the implementation needs to be fixed to:
- Prevent disappearance when hover radius is 0
- Properly handle cases where hover radius equals original radius to avoid unexpected size increases

These appear to be bugs that need to be addressed in the Chart.js library itself.
