Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide structured answers.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined when using scatter chart
**Cause**: The error occurs when setting `defaults.layout.paddings` in Chart.js v3.0.0-rc.2. This suggests there's an incompatibility or structural change in how layout padding is handled in this version compared to previous versions. The error indicates the code is trying to access a 'value' property on an undefined object.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Configuration structure mismatch in options object
**Cause**: The options object structure appears to be incorrect for Chart.js v3.0.0-rc.2. Specifically:
1. `scales` is incorrectly nested under `plugins` instead of being at the root level of options
2. The layout padding is being set globally through `ChartControl.defaults.layout.padding` which might conflict with the chart-specific `layout: {}` in the options

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential version compatibility issues
**Cause**: Using `window.Chart3 || Chart` suggests mixing different versions or improper initialization of Chart.js. This could lead to undefined behaviors when accessing properties, especially in a release candidate version (rc.2).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from three key areas:
1. Incorrect handling of layout padding properties in v3.0.0-rc.2
2. Mismatched configuration structure in the options object, particularly with scales and plugins
3. Potential version conflicts or initialization issues

The primary fix would likely involve:
- Updating the options structure to match v3.0.0-rc.2 specifications
- Reviewing the layout padding implementation
- Ensuring proper Chart.js initialization and version consistency
- Consider upgrading to a stable version instead of using a release candidate
