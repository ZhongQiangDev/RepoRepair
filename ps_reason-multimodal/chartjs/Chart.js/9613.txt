Let me analyze the GitHub problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Tooltip not showing up when using pointerdown/pointerup events on touchscreen after upgrading from Chart.js v2.9.4 to v3.5.1
**Cause**: The event types are being normalized in Chart.js v3.x, but the plugin event filters are still using the original event types. Specifically, pointer events are being normalized to mouse events in the platform.dom.js file, causing a mismatch between the expected and actual event types.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Event filtering system failing to recognize touch interactions
**Cause**: The tooltip plugin configuration is expecting pointer events ('pointerdown', 'pointerup'), but the events are being normalized to mouse events ('mousedown', 'mouseup'). The event filter doesn't recognize these normalized events because they don't match the original pointer event types.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an architectural change in Chart.js v3.x where events are normalized to mouse events, but the plugin event filtering system isn't properly handling this normalization. This creates a disconnect between the expected pointer events and the actual normalized mouse events. The problem can be resolved by either:
1. Adding the normalized event types ('mousedown', 'mouseup') to the tooltip plugin configuration
2. Or updating the event filtering system to handle both original and normalized event types

The immediate workaround is to update the tooltip plugin configuration to include the normalized mouse events, but a more comprehensive solution might involve updating the event handling system to better handle event normalization.
