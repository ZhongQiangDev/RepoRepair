Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Legend label click actions are targeting the wrong items when labels are multi-line and legend is positioned on the right
**Cause**: The click event handler is likely using incorrect vertical position calculations that don't properly account for multi-line text spacing and positioning, causing a mismatch between the visual position and the actual clickable areas

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The offset/misalignment gets worse as more legend items are added
**Cause**: There appears to be a cumulative positioning error where each additional legend item increases the vertical position discrepancy, suggesting the spacing/padding calculations between legend items may not be properly accounting for variable height items

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Hover events are also affected by the same misalignment issue
**Cause**: The hover event detection is likely using the same incorrect position calculation logic as the click events, indicating this is a fundamental issue with the legend item position mapping rather than just click handling

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue specifically occurs with right-aligned legends
**Cause**: The position calculation logic for right-aligned legends may be using different positioning math compared to other legend positions (top, bottom, left), suggesting special handling for right-aligned legends isn't properly implementing multi-line support

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be incorrect position calculations for legend items when using right-aligned legends with multi-line labels. This manifests in both click and hover events targeting wrong items, with the problem becoming more pronounced as more items are added. The root cause seems to be in the positioning logic specifically for right-aligned legends that doesn't properly account for multi-line text heights and spacing, leading to a cumulative positioning error that affects event handling.
