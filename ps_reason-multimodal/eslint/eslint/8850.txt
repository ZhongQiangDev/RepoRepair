Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: ESLint 4.1.0 reports indentation errors for valid JSX code that worked fine in version 4.0, specifically when using parentheses around JSX in binary expressions.
**Cause**: The indent rule in ESLint 4.1.0 appears to have changed how it handles indentation for JSX elements within parentheses in binary expressions (&&), treating them differently than in version 4.0.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent indentation requirements between parenthesized and non-parenthesized JSX expressions.
**Cause**: The indent rule is treating the same logical expression differently based on whether parentheses are present:
- With parentheses: Reports errors
- Without parentheses: Works correctly
This suggests a regression in how the indent rule handles parenthesized expressions in JSX context.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The linter forces unnatural/inconsistent indentation patterns in JSX.
**Cause**: The new indentation rule in 4.1.0 seems to expect the JSX element to align with the start of the parentheses rather than following the natural indentation pattern that most developers use and that worked in version 4.0.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is a regression in ESLint 4.1.0's indent rule that incorrectly handles JSX indentation when using parentheses in binary expressions. The problem manifests in three ways:
1. Breaking previously valid code from version 4.0
2. Inconsistent behavior between parenthesized and non-parenthesized expressions
3. Forcing unnatural indentation patterns

The root cause appears to be changes in how the indent rule processes JSX elements within parenthesized expressions, particularly in the context of logical operators like &&. This is likely a bug rather than an intentional change, as it breaks previously working code and creates inconsistent behavior.
