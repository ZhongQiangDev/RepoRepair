Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `--max-warnings` flag becomes ineffective when used together with `--quiet`
**Cause**: The `--quiet` flag is suppressing all warnings, including those that should trigger the `--max-warnings` threshold, making the warning limit check useless

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The exit code remains 0 even when warnings exceed the max-warnings threshold in quiet mode
**Cause**: The warning count check appears to be performed after the quiet flag filters out the warnings, resulting in an incorrect count comparison against the threshold

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of visibility into important warnings when using both flags
**Cause**: The current implementation prioritizes the `--quiet` flag's behavior over the `--max-warnings` threshold, preventing users from seeing warnings that should be considered critical enough to fail the process

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the interaction between two CLI flags: `--quiet` and `--max-warnings`. The quiet mode is taking precedence and suppressing all warnings before the max-warnings threshold can be properly evaluated. This creates three main problems: ineffective warning limits, incorrect exit codes, and hidden critical warnings. The solution needs to either prioritize the max-warnings threshold over quiet mode or ensure the warning count is evaluated before quiet mode suppression occurs.
