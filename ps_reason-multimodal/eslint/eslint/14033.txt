Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: ESLint's --fix command transforms `let foo = undefined;` into `const foo;`, which creates a JavaScript syntax error
**Cause**: The autofix functionality is incorrectly handling the combination of two rules:
- `prefer-const` rule is converting `let` to `const`
- `no-undef-init` rule is removing the `undefined` initialization
The order of operations is causing an invalid JavaScript statement since constants must be initialized when declared

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Rule order definition in the ESLint config is being ignored
**Cause**: ESLint's autofix system appears to have a fixed internal order for applying fixes, regardless of how rules are ordered in the configuration file. This prevents the user from controlling which rule should be applied first.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Mass autofixing on legacy code (10k+ files) introduces breaking changes
**Cause**: The autofix functionality lacks proper validation to ensure that the resulting code remains valid JavaScript after applying multiple rule fixes. There's no safety check to prevent transformations that would result in invalid syntax.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from ESLint's autofix functionality not properly handling the interaction between `prefer-const` and `no-undef-init` rules. The system ignores rule ordering and lacks validation of the final output, leading to invalid JavaScript code when processing variables initialized with `undefined`. This becomes particularly problematic when running mass fixes on large legacy codebases. The fix would need to either:
1. Respect rule ordering
2. Add validation for const declarations
3. Make the rules aware of each other's transformations
4. Or prevent the removal of undefined initialization when converting to const
