Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The image link with escaped square brackets in the alt text `[![\[Manny Pacquiao\]](...)` is not rendering properly as a clickable image thumbnail
**Cause**: The Markdown parser is treating the escaped square brackets `\[` and `\]` in the alt text as literal characters rather than part of the image syntax, breaking the expected nested image-link format

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The demo page shows different rendering between expected and actual results when square brackets are escaped
**Cause**: The Markdown specification and the parser (marked.js in this case) may have different interpretations of how escaped characters should be handled within alt text portions of image links, especially in nested structures (image within link)

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The nested structure of having an image inside a link `[![alt](img-url)](link-url)` fails when special characters are escaped
**Cause**: The multiple levels of parsing (first for the outer link, then for the inner image) may be conflicting with the escape character handling, causing the parser to fail in maintaining the proper structure

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from how escaped characters (specifically square brackets) are handled within alt text in nested Markdown structures. The problem manifests in three related ways: broken image rendering, inconsistent behavior between expected and actual results, and failure of nested structures. This appears to be either a parser implementation issue in marked.js or an ambiguity in the Markdown specification regarding escape character handling in nested constructs. The solution would likely involve modifying how the parser handles escaped characters specifically within image alt text contexts.
