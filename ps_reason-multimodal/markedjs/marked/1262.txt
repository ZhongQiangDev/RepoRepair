Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The table cells containing special characters (|) are not being rendered properly, causing the table structure to break
**Cause**: The Marked parser (v0.4.0) is interpreting the vertical bar (|) in `string|ReactNode` as a table column delimiter instead of treating it as part of the content, which breaks the table formatting

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The escaped backslashes (\) in `object\[]` are not being processed correctly in the table
**Cause**: The Marked parser may not be properly handling escaped characters within table cells, treating them as literal characters instead of escape sequences

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The overall table formatting is completely broken, showing raw markdown text instead of a properly formatted table
**Cause**: The combination of special characters (| and \) in the content is causing the Marked parser to fail in maintaining proper table structure and markdown parsing rules

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from Marked v0.4.0's handling of special characters within table cells. The parser is not properly escaping or handling vertical bars (|) and backslashes (\) in table content, which leads to broken table formatting. This appears to be a limitation or bug in this specific version of the Marked parser. The solution would likely involve either:
1. Upgrading to a newer version of Marked that handles these cases better
2. Properly escaping special characters in the markdown content
3. Using an alternative markdown parser that better handles these edge cases
