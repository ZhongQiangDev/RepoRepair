Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The space node appears inside the last list_item instead of being at the root level between the List and Paragraph nodes.
**Cause**: The marked lexer's parsing algorithm is treating the whitespace after the last list item as part of the list item itself, rather than as a separator between the list and the following paragraph. This appears to be due to how the lexer handles list termination and whitespace consumption.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent handling of whitespace between list items versus after the list
**Cause**: The lexer seems to have different rules for handling whitespace between list items compared to whitespace after the list ends. While whitespace between items is properly contained within the list structure, the trailing whitespace is being captured in the last item instead of being promoted to the root level.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The semantic tree structure doesn't accurately represent the document's logical structure
**Cause**: The current implementation of the marked lexer doesn't properly distinguish between content that belongs to a list item and content that serves as a structural separator between major elements (lists and paragraphs). This makes tree traversal and manipulation more complicated than necessary.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the marked lexer's whitespace handling mechanism, particularly around list structures. The main problems are:
1. Incorrect placement of whitespace nodes in the semantic tree
2. Inconsistent whitespace handling rules
3. Non-intuitive tree structure that complicates document processing

The lexer needs to be modified to treat whitespace after lists as a separate structural element at the root level, rather than as content belonging to the last list item. This would make the semantic tree more logical and easier to process programmatically.
