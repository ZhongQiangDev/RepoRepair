Let me analyze the GitHub issue based on the provided information.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The CLI output shows untranslated i18n text strings (showing raw i18n keys/identifiers instead of translated text)
**Cause**: The internationalization (i18n) system is not properly loading or processing the translation files when running the lighthouse CLI command, causing the raw i18n keys to be displayed instead of their translated values.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message format appears broken with raw template literals
**Cause**: The string interpolation or template processing system for error messages is not working correctly in the CLI context, leaving the template placeholders unprocessed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be related to the i18n implementation in the lighthouse CLI tool. There are two interconnected problems: 1) The translation system is not properly initialized or integrated when running lighthouse from the command line, causing raw i18n keys to be displayed instead of translated text, and 2) The error message templating system is not processing the message templates correctly, resulting in unformatted output. This suggests there might be an issue with how the i18n and templating systems are being initialized or configured specifically in the CLI context, even though they might work correctly in other contexts (like the browser-based version).
