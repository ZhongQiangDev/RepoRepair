Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: JavaScript error "Cannot read property 'ts' of undefined" occurs when generating a report in Chrome extension
**Cause**: The error indicates that the code is trying to access a 'ts' property on an object that is undefined. This typically happens when:
1. The data structure expected by the code is not properly initialized
2. There's an asynchronous timing issue where the data isn't loaded before it's accessed
3. The Chrome extension update may have changed how data is structured or accessed

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error only occurs in the Chrome extension but not in the browser application
**Cause**: This behavior difference suggests:
1. The Chrome extension environment might have different execution context or permissions than the browser
2. The extension update may have broken compatibility with existing code
3. Data initialization or loading might work differently in the extension context compared to the browser context

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a JavaScript reference error that manifests specifically in the Chrome extension environment after an update. The problem likely stems from either improper data initialization, asynchronous timing issues, or changes in the extension's execution context that weren't properly accounted for in the update. The fact that it works in the browser but not in the extension suggests the issue is specific to how the extension handles data or executes code, rather than a fundamental problem with the application logic itself.

To fix this, developers should:
1. Verify data initialization in the extension context
2. Check for any asynchronous operations that might need proper handling
3. Review changes introduced in the Chrome extension update that might affect data structure or access patterns
