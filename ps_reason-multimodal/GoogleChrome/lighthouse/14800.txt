Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse returns an error "Unable to determine tid for renderer process"
**Cause**: The "FrameCommittedInBrowser" event contains a `processPseudoId` instead of the expected `processId`, leading to undefined values in `mainFramePids`

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Process identification mechanism failure
**Cause**: The Chrome DevTools Protocol appears to be returning a different identifier format than what Lighthouse expects (pseudoId vs regular processId), suggesting a potential protocol mismatch or change in Chrome's behavior

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent process ID handling across Chrome versions
**Cause**: The issue occurs across multiple Chrome versions (including Canary 112.0.5597.0), indicating this might be a broader change in how Chrome handles process IDs rather than a version-specific bug

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a mismatch between Lighthouse's expected process identification mechanism and what Chrome is actually providing. The main technical problem is that Chrome is sending `processPseudoId` instead of `processId` in the "FrameCommittedInBrowser" event, which breaks Lighthouse's ability to track renderer processes. This appears to be a systematic issue affecting multiple Chrome versions, suggesting either a change in Chrome's architecture or a need for Lighthouse to update its process identification handling to accommodate both types of IDs.

The fix would likely require either:
1. Updating Lighthouse to handle both `processPseudoId` and `processId`
2. Understanding why Chrome is sending `processPseudoId` and potentially requesting a fix from the Chrome team
3. Implementing a fallback mechanism in Lighthouse for cases where `processId` is not available
