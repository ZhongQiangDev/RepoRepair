Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent decimal place display in the "Transfer size" column where some values show no decimal (e.g., "18 KiB") while others show one decimal place.
**Cause**: The current number formatting logic likely uses a default number formatting that removes trailing zeros after the decimal point, causing inconsistent digit alignment in the column.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor visual alignment of numbers in the "Transfer size" column making it difficult to quickly compare values
**Cause**: The varying number of visible digits (due to omitted decimal places) causes the numbers to misalign, making it especially challenging for users with vision impairments to scan and compare values across rows.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential misinterpretation of values when quickly scanning the column (e.g., "18 KiB" vs "20.4 KiB")
**Cause**: The inconsistent number format presentation can lead to cognitive load when comparing numbers, as the brain needs to process different number formats within the same column.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from inconsistent number formatting in the JavaScript library size comparison view, specifically in the "Transfer size" column. The current implementation omits decimal places for whole numbers, which creates three main problems: inconsistent decimal display, poor visual alignment, and potential misinterpretation of values. These issues particularly impact accessibility for users with vision impairments. The solution would be to standardize the number format to always show one decimal place, even for whole numbers (e.g., "18.0 KiB" instead of "18 KiB"), ensuring consistent visual alignment and easier comparison of values.
