Let me analyze the GitHub issue based on the provided information.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The CLI output shows untranslated i18n text strings (showing raw i18n keys/identifiers instead of translated text)
**Cause**: The internationalization (i18n) system is not properly loading or processing the translation files when running the lighthouse CLI command. This could be due to:
1. Missing translation files
2. Incorrect path to translation files
3. i18n initialization not happening before CLI execution

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message format appears broken with raw template literals
**Cause**: The string interpolation or template processing system is not properly handling the i18n text replacement. This suggests that:
1. The i18n middleware/processor is not properly integrated into the CLI's output handling
2. The template processing step is being skipped or failing during CLI execution

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue appears to be a combination of i18n system failures in the Lighthouse CLI tool. The main problems stem from improper handling of internationalization during CLI execution, resulting in raw i18n keys being displayed instead of translated text. This affects both the main output and error messages, suggesting a fundamental issue with either the i18n initialization process or the integration between the CLI's output handling and the translation system. To fix this, both the i18n system integration and template processing need to be properly implemented in the CLI execution path.
