Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Chrome DevTools Lighthouse audit incorrectly reports that compression should be enabled, despite gzip compression already being active
**Cause**: There appears to be a discrepancy between how Lighthouse audit and the Network panel detect compression. While the Network panel correctly shows gzip compression (confirmed by curl request showing "Content-Encoding: gzip"), Lighthouse seems to have a false negative in its compression detection logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between different Chrome tools in reporting compression status
**Cause**: The different tools in Chrome (Lighthouse vs Network Panel) may be using different methods to detect compression:
- Network Panel looks directly at HTTP headers
- Lighthouse audit may be using a different verification method that's not properly recognizing the gzip encoding header

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is that Lighthouse audit is incorrectly reporting missing compression when it is actually enabled, as verified through multiple methods (Chrome Network Panel and curl request). This appears to be a bug in Lighthouse's compression detection logic rather than an actual compression problem with the website. The server is correctly implementing gzip compression as evidenced by the "Content-Encoding: gzip" header in the HTTP response, but Lighthouse is failing to recognize this properly. This creates a misleading audit result that could confuse developers about their site's actual compression status.
