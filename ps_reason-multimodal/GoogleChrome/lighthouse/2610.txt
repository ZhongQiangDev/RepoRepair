Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: All items in the Critical Request Chain show identical sizes
**Cause**: There appears to be a regression in the size calculation logic of Lighthouse that causes it to incorrectly assign the same size value to all resources in the chain, rather than showing their actual individual sizes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The displayed sizes don't match actual resource sizes
**Cause**: The size calculation mechanism seems to have broken between the working version in February and the reported versions (Chrome Canary 61.0.3141.0 and Lighthouse Extension 2.1.0), suggesting either:
1. A bug introduced in the size measurement code
2. Changes in how resource sizes are retrieved from the network requests
3. Possible caching issues affecting size reporting

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists across different platforms (Windows and OSX)
**Cause**: Since the problem appears on multiple operating systems, this indicates:
1. The issue is in Lighthouse's core functionality rather than platform-specific code
2. The bug was likely introduced in a core component that handles resource size calculations or reporting

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around incorrect size reporting in Lighthouse's Critical Request Chain feature. The problem manifests as identical sizes being shown for all resources, regardless of their actual sizes. This appears to be a regression that affects multiple platforms and versions of Lighthouse (both built-in Chrome Canary and Extension versions). The root cause likely lies in Lighthouse's core resource size calculation logic, which was working correctly in February but broke in subsequent updates. The cross-platform nature of the issue suggests it's a fundamental problem in the core code rather than a platform-specific bug.
