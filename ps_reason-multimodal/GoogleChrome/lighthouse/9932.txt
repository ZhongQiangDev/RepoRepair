Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided screenshot, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Data URIs are being treated as network requests with server response times
**Cause**: The simulator is not differentiating between regular network URLs and data URIs, treating all URLs uniformly in terms of connection handling and timing calculations.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unrealistic server response time for data URIs
**Cause**: The system is applying standard network timing metrics to data URIs, which are actually local resources that don't require server communication.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Excessive Round Trip Time (RTT) for local resources
**Cause**: The simulation model doesn't have special handling for local resources like data URIs, resulting in them being processed through the same network simulation pipeline as remote requests.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the simulator's treatment of data URIs as network requests. This leads to three main problems: incorrect request handling, unrealistic server response times, and excessive RTT values. The root cause appears to be the lack of differentiation between network and non-network URLs in the Lantern codebase. A proper fix would involve adding specific handling for data URIs and other local resources, with more appropriate timing calculations (suggested 5-10ms RTT) and removal of server response time calculations for these cases.
