Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse reports better performance scores for pages with iframes compared to directly accessing the iframe content, even when the iframe content is causing significant performance issues.
**Cause**: Lighthouse's current implementation doesn't properly account for or aggregate performance metrics from iframes into the parent page's performance evaluation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Misleading performance metrics when dealing with bandwidth-limited iframes
**Cause**: The testing shows that when an iframe is artificially limited to 50kbps, the performance impact isn't properly reflected in the parent page's Lighthouse score (70 points vs 40 points for direct access).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incomplete performance auditing for multi-company service architectures
**Cause**: Many architectures still use iframes to include services from different companies, but Lighthouse's current implementation doesn't adequately measure cross-origin iframe performance impacts.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Resource consumption of iframes isn't properly factored into the overall performance score
**Cause**: The evaluation system appears to treat iframe content as secondary to the main page content, rather than considering it as an integral part of the total page load and performance characteristics.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is that Lighthouse's current implementation has significant limitations in how it handles iframe performance measurement. The tool fails to properly aggregate and reflect iframe performance metrics in the parent page's score, leading to misleading results especially in cases with resource-intensive iframes or cross-origin content. This is particularly problematic for modern web architectures that rely on iframes for cross-company service integration. The disparity between direct content access scores and iframe-embedded content scores indicates a fundamental gap in how Lighthouse evaluates composite page performance.
