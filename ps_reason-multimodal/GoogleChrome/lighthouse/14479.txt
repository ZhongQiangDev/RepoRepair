Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: DOM size audit values are showing unnecessary decimal places (e.g., "1234.0" instead of "1234")
**Cause**: The number formatting in the code is likely not using integer formatting, but rather using a floating-point number format that automatically adds ".0" to whole numbers

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent number presentation in the UI
**Cause**: The code is probably using a default number-to-string conversion method that doesn't specify the desired precision/format, resulting in floating-point representation even for integer values

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that DOM size metrics, which are inherently whole numbers (integers), are being displayed with unnecessary decimal places (".0"). This is likely due to using floating-point number formatting instead of integer formatting in the code. This is both unnecessary and potentially confusing for users. The fix would involve modifying the number formatting to explicitly handle these values as integers, either by using Math.floor() or parseInt(), or by using appropriate number formatting options to remove decimal places for whole numbers.
