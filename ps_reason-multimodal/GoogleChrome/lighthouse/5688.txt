Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse is not detecting and flagging BMP images under the "serve images under next gen formats" audit
**Cause**: The audit system likely doesn't include the MIME type 'x-ms-bmp' in its list of legacy image formats that should be flagged for optimization recommendations

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The legacy-image-formats feature policy warning system is not properly identifying BMP images
**Cause**: The feature policy implementation may not be properly configured to recognize and warn about BMP format images, despite them being a legacy format that should be flagged for modernization

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The performance optimization recommendations are incomplete for the test page
**Cause**: The audit rules in Lighthouse version 3 may not have comprehensive coverage for all legacy image formats, specifically missing the BMP format in its optimization checks

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around Lighthouse's inability to properly identify and flag BMP images as legacy formats that should be converted to more modern formats. This stems from three main causes: incomplete MIME type detection for BMP images, gaps in the legacy-image-formats feature policy implementation, and insufficient audit rules for legacy format detection in Lighthouse v3. The solution would likely involve updating Lighthouse's image format detection system to properly include BMP files in its next-gen format recommendations.
