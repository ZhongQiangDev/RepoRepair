Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and the provided screenshot.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The tool is reporting a false positive error about manifest's short name length when the short_name field is actually missing in the manifest.
**Cause**: The validation logic appears to be checking the length of short_name without first verifying if the short_name property exists in the manifest. This leads to an incorrect validation error being displayed when the field is not present.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message is misleading as it suggests there's a length issue when the actual issue is a missing field.
**Cause**: The error handling code likely doesn't have proper conditional checks to distinguish between a missing field case and an invalid length case, resulting in the wrong error message being displayed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper validation logic that doesn't handle the absence of the short_name field correctly. The tool needs to first check for the existence of the short_name field before attempting to validate its length. This leads to two problems: false positive validation errors and misleading error messages. The fix would likely involve adding a proper existence check before performing length validation, and providing appropriate error messages for missing fields versus invalid length scenarios.
