Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: UX issues with timeline markers making them difficult to work with
**Cause**: The current implementation simply injects metrics as fake trace events, which results in basic markers that aren't optimized for user interaction and visualization in the Timeline view

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Metrics data needs to be artificially converted to trace events
**Cause**: There's no native way to represent performance metrics in the trace format, requiring a workaround of creating "fake" trace events to inject the metrics data

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Extra step required to save assets (--save-assets flag) to include metrics in trace
**Cause**: The current implementation requires an additional explicit flag to enable metric export, making it a non-default behavior that users need to remember to enable

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Two separate patches needed (Lighthouse and DevTools) to implement the functionality
**Cause**: The feature requires changes in both the data collection (Lighthouse) and visualization (DevTools) components, indicating a lack of standardized approach for handling performance metrics in traces

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the implementation complexity and user experience of viewing performance metrics in the Timeline. The solution requires workarounds (fake trace events), additional user steps (save-assets flag), and changes to multiple components (Lighthouse and DevTools). The most significant issue is the poor UX of the timeline markers, suggesting that a more integrated and user-friendly approach to displaying performance metrics in the Timeline view is needed. The underlying cause appears to be the lack of native support for performance metrics in the trace format and timeline visualization.
