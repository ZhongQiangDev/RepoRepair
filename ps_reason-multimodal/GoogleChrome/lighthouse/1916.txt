Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Lighthouse audit is flagging an SVG image as an "offscreen image" even though SVGs are scalable vector graphics that don't have fixed dimensions like raster images.
**Cause**: The audit appears to be treating SVG files the same way as raster images (jpg, png etc.) when calculating image areas, leading to incorrect detection of "zero area" for vector graphics that can scale dynamically.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The debugString is showing up for an SVG in the offscreen images audit which may not be relevant for vector graphics.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the offscreen images audit doesn't have special handling for SVG files, which have different characteristics than raster images in terms of rendering and display areas.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the Lighthouse audit system not properly distinguishing between vector graphics (SVGs) and raster images when performing offscreen image detection. SVGs are fundamentally different from regular images as they are scalable and don't have fixed dimensions, making the current area-based detection potentially inappropriate for them. The audit either needs to implement special handling for SVGs or consider excluding them from this particular check since the concept of "offscreen" may not apply to them in the same way it does to regular images.

The question about whether to ignore SVGs in this audit is valid and should be considered based on whether checking for offscreen SVGs provides meaningful performance insights, given their unique characteristics as vector graphics.
