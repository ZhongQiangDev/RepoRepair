Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Excessive and irrelevant user timing marks appearing in performance measurements
**Cause**: Third-party scripts (specifically Google Ads) are injecting numerous timing measurements into the browser's User Timing API, cluttering the performance data with non-essential metrics

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of filtering mechanism for user timing marks
**Cause**: No established criteria or system to filter out unwanted timing marks from third-party sources, making it difficult to focus on relevant performance metrics

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential performance impact from excessive timing marks
**Cause**: Large number of timing measurements being recorded could potentially impact browser performance and make it harder to analyze truly important performance data

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around third-party scripts (particularly Google Ads) injecting numerous timing marks into the performance measurements. This creates three related problems: pollution of timing data with irrelevant measurements, lack of a proper filtering mechanism, and potential performance overhead. The core need is to implement a filtering system to separate relevant timing marks from third-party noise, though determining the filtering criteria remains a challenge. A solution might involve either hardcoding specific filters or developing a more dynamic filtering mechanism based on timing mark patterns or sources.
