From the provided GitHub issue description and screenshot, I'll analyze the visual style issues with the PWA header gauge.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The gauge/meter element appears to have inconsistent or incorrect styling compared to the intended design
**Cause**: Likely CSS styling issues with the meter/progress element, possibly missing proper styling rules or conflicting styles

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The gauge appears to have a non-standard or unpolished visual appearance
**Cause**: Missing or incorrect CSS properties for visual elements like borders, colors, gradients or other styling attributes that would make it match the intended PWA design system

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The gauge element seems to lack proper alignment or positioning in the header
**Cause**: Insufficient CSS layout properties (like flexbox or grid settings) to properly position and align the gauge within its container

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues appear to be related to CSS styling and layout problems affecting the PWA header gauge component. The gauge lacks proper visual styling and positioning, likely due to missing or incorrect CSS rules for appearance and layout. To fix these issues, the CSS styling needs to be reviewed and updated to match the intended design specifications for the PWA header gauge element.

Note: Due to limited context in the issue description and single screenshot, some assumptions were made about the specific styling issues. More detailed information about the intended design and current CSS implementation would help provide more specific causes and solutions.
