Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse audit hangs indefinitely at "Loading page & waiting for onload" step
**Cause**: The issue appears to be different from known common causes (HSTS, server failures, HTTP availability, about:blank, or missing document requests), suggesting a potential new root cause related to either:
- Service Worker implementation issues (given the tested page is about Service Workers)
- Page load event not firing properly
- Network timeout or connectivity issues

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Problem occurs consistently across both native audit and Lighthouse extension
**Cause**: Since the issue manifests in both environments (native Chrome audit and Lighthouse extension v2.8.0), this suggests:
- A fundamental issue with the website's architecture or implementation
- Possible incompatibility with Chrome version 63.0.3239.132
- Not an environment-specific or extension-specific bug

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Issue persists across all pages of the site
**Cause**: The widespread nature of the problem across the entire domain indicates:
- A global configuration issue in the website
- Possible problems with shared components (like the Service Worker)
- Site-wide implementation patterns that might be interfering with Lighthouse's ability to complete its audit

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is Lighthouse's inability to complete its audit, hanging at the page load step. This appears to be a unique case not matching previously identified common causes. The problem's persistence across different testing methods and pages suggests a fundamental issue with either:
1. The website's Service Worker implementation
2. Page load event handling
3. Global site configuration
4. Potential incompatibility between the site's architecture and Lighthouse's testing methodology

The fact that this issue was previously reported and remains unresolved indicates it might be a complex edge case requiring deeper investigation into the interaction between Lighthouse and the site's specific implementation.
