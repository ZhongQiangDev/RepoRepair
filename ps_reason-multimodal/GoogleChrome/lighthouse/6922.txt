Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse appears to be unable to analyze network requests from Out-of-Process IFrames (OOPIFs)
**Cause**: Lighthouse is not implementing the target discovery mechanism that Chrome DevTools uses (Target.sendMessageToTarget and Target.receivedMessageFromTarget) to communicate with and gather data from iframes

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited visibility of network activity in Lighthouse reports
**Cause**: Lighthouse seems to only capture network requests from the main frame, missing requests initiated from embedded iframes since it's not doing the iframe target discovery and monitoring

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential incomplete performance analysis
**Cause**: Without monitoring OOPIF network activity, Lighthouse may provide incomplete or inaccurate performance metrics when analyzing pages with significant iframe content

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is that Lighthouse lacks the capability to properly handle Out-of-Process IFrames (OOPIFs) unlike Chrome DevTools. This stems from not implementing the target discovery and communication mechanism (Target.sendMessageToTarget/Target.receivedMessageFromTarget) that DevTools uses. As a result, Lighthouse can only analyze network requests from the main frame, potentially missing important network activity from iframes and providing incomplete performance analysis for pages with iframe content. This limitation needs to be addressed by implementing proper OOPIF handling similar to how Chrome DevTools does it.
