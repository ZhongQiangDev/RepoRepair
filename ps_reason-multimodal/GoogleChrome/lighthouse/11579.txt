Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse reports NO_FCP (No First Contentful Paint) when running performance measurements through the extension
**Cause**: The issue appears to be related to tab visibility/background state. When Lighthouse is run through the extension and the tab is not in focus or is in the background, it cannot properly measure First Contentful Paint metrics, which is a critical performance measurement.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Performance evaluation and PWA checklist cannot be completed
**Cause**: Since FCP (First Contentful Paint) is a fundamental metric for performance evaluation, its failure prevents the completion of both performance measurements and Progressive Web App (PWA) checklist validation. This is likely because:
1. FCP is a core metric that other measurements depend on
2. The extension's implementation might differ from the CLI version in how it handles background tabs
3. Chrome's throttling of background tabs might be interfering with the measurements

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists across different environments and Chrome profiles
**Cause**: The problem appears to be systematic within the extension itself rather than environment-specific because:
1. It occurs on both remote servers and localhost
2. It happens even with clean Chrome profiles
3. The CLI version works correctly, indicating the issue is specific to the extension's implementation

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is that Lighthouse's extension cannot properly measure First Contentful Paint (NO_FCP) when running in background tabs, which consequently prevents both performance evaluation and PWA checklist validation. This appears to be an extension-specific implementation issue rather than an environmental or configuration problem, as evidenced by the CLI version working correctly. The problem is likely related to how the extension handles tab visibility states and Chrome's background tab behavior, affecting the fundamental metrics collection process.
