Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Email links (mailto:) with rel="noopener" attribute are not working properly on Chrome for Android and iOS Safari
**Cause**: The combination of target="_blank" and rel="noopener" on mailto: links appears to interfere with the normal handling of email links on mobile browsers. While rel="noopener" is a security feature meant for external website links, it's unnecessarily being applied to mailto: links which don't pose the same security risks.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Security audit tool flagging mailto: links without rel="noopener"
**Cause**: The security audit tool is not properly distinguishing between regular web links and mailto: links when checking for the rel="noopener" attribute. This is causing false positives in the security audit, as mailto: links don't need the same security considerations as regular web links since they open email clients rather than new web pages.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between links with and without rel="noopener"
**Cause**: As shown in the code example, the first link (sales@) works correctly because it doesn't have rel="noopener", while the second link (support@) fails because it includes rel="noopener". This inconsistency creates a confusing user experience and indicates that the rel="noopener" attribute is incompatible with mailto: links on mobile browsers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an overzealous security audit tool that's requiring rel="noopener" on all links with target="_blank", including mailto: links. This requirement causes problems because:
1. Mailto: links don't need the same security protections as regular web links
2. The combination of rel="noopener" with mailto: links breaks functionality on mobile browsers
3. The security audit tool needs to be modified to ignore mailto: links when checking for rel="noopener"
The solution would be to modify the security audit tool to exclude mailto: links from the rel="noopener" requirement, as these links serve a different purpose and don't pose the same security risks as regular web links.
