Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prettier removes the trailing comma in generic type parameter (`<T,>`) when formatting `.mts` files, even though it's required by the TypeScript compiler.
**Cause**: Prettier's TypeScript parser is not properly handling the trailing comma requirement for unconstrained generic type parameters in `.mts` files. This appears to be a discrepancy between Prettier's formatting rules and TypeScript's compiler requirements specifically for ES modules.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting is inconsistent with TypeScript compiler's expectations for ES modules.
**Cause**: In TypeScript when using ES modules (`.mts` files), unconstrained generic type parameters require a trailing comma to disambiguate between JSX syntax and type parameters. Prettier's formatter is not respecting this TypeScript-specific requirement for ES module files.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The code becomes potentially invalid after formatting.
**Cause**: The removal of the trailing comma by Prettier could cause TypeScript compilation errors in ES module contexts, as shown in the error message from the screenshot: "error TS1160: Unterminated template literal."

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prettier's handling of generic type parameters in TypeScript ES module files (`.mts`). While Prettier is removing trailing commas in generic type parameters (`<T,>` â†’ `<T>`), this actually conflicts with TypeScript's compiler requirements for ES modules, where the trailing comma is mandatory for unconstrained generics to avoid ambiguity with JSX syntax. This formatting behavior needs to be adjusted to maintain compatibility with TypeScript's ES module requirements and prevent potential compilation errors.
