Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The JSX formatting is unstable and keeps alternating between two different formats when formatting is applied multiple times.
**Cause**: The issue appears to be related to how Prettier handles the Unicode character \u3000 (ideographic space/full-width space) when it's placed between JSX elements. The formatter seems to have inconsistent rules about whether to add line breaks around this special character.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent handling of whitespace around the ideographic space character
**Cause**: Prettier's parser is treating the ideographic space (ã€€) differently from regular spaces. In one pass, it decides to preserve the space inline, while in another pass, it decides to add a line break before the space, leading to an oscillating behavior between formats.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatter doesn't maintain a stable output after multiple formatting passes
**Cause**: This indicates a violation of Prettier's core principle of idempotency, where formatting the same code multiple times should produce the same result. The root cause appears to be a bug in how Prettier's babel parser handles non-standard whitespace characters in JSX contexts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around Prettier's inconsistent handling of the ideographic space character (\u3000) in JSX contexts. The formatter alternates between two different formatting styles, violating the principle of stable formatting. This is caused by:
1. Inconsistent parsing rules for special Unicode whitespace characters
2. Lack of proper handling for ideographic spaces in JSX
3. A bug in the formatting logic that causes it to flip between two valid but different formatting decisions

The issue needs to be addressed by implementing consistent rules for handling special whitespace characters in JSX contexts and ensuring the formatter maintains stability across multiple passes.
