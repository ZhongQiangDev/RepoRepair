Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: A comma is incorrectly inserted in the empty array `[]` when formatting the TypeScript type definition
**Cause**: The formatter appears to be incorrectly treating the empty array `[]` as a multi-line array when the line length reaches the print-width limit (120 characters). This causes it to split the empty array and add a trailing comma, which is syntactically incorrect for an empty array.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent line breaking and indentation in the output
**Cause**: The formatter is making suboptimal decisions about where to break lines when the total line length exactly matches the print-width (120 characters). Instead of keeping the simple empty array `[]` on one line or breaking the type definition in a more logical place (like after extends), it's breaking inside the empty array pattern.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting is different when the identifier length varies
**Cause**: The bug appears to be triggered by a specific edge case where the total line length matches exactly with the print-width setting (120 characters). This suggests there's a boundary condition issue in Prettier's line-breaking logic that only manifests at exact width matches.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual output shows unexpected whitespace and line breaks
**Cause**: The formatter's algorithm for handling TypeScript generics combined with the trailing comma setting (`--trailing-comma all`) is causing unexpected interactions when dealing with empty arrays in type definitions, particularly when line length constraints come into play.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prettier's handling of empty arrays in TypeScript type definitions when specific conditions are met (exact print-width match at 120 characters). The formatter incorrectly applies trailing comma rules to empty arrays and makes poor decisions about line breaking and indentation. This appears to be a bug in Prettier's TypeScript parser or formatting logic, specifically in how it handles the intersection of generics, empty arrays, and line width constraints. The issues manifest as incorrect comma insertion, unexpected line breaks, and inconsistent formatting depending on identifier length.
