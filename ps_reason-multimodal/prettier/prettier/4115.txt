Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prettier continuously adds extra indentation to nested HTML tables in Markdown files each time the file is saved
**Cause**: Prettier seems to be misinterpreting the nesting level of HTML content within Markdown numbered lists, causing it to add additional indentation on each save operation instead of maintaining the correct indentation level

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between code blocks and HTML content formatting
**Cause**: Prettier appears to handle code blocks and HTML content differently in Markdown:
- Code blocks eventually stabilize after correct nesting
- HTML content continues to receive additional indentation on each save, suggesting different parsing rules for HTML vs code blocks

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting breaks the intended document structure
**Cause**: The excessive indentation pushes the HTML table content too far to the right, breaking the visual hierarchy and making the content harder to read and maintain. This happens because Prettier is not properly recognizing where the HTML content should be aligned within the Markdown list context.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prettier's handling of mixed Markdown and HTML content, specifically:
1. A bug in how Prettier calculates indentation levels for HTML content nested within Markdown lists
2. Inconsistent formatting rules between different types of nested content (code blocks vs HTML)
3. The cumulative effect of incorrect indentation being applied on each save operation, leading to progressively worse formatting

The problem appears to be a fundamental issue with Prettier's Markdown parser and its interaction with nested HTML content, rather than a user configuration issue. This explains why turning off format-on-save or ignoring Markdown files are the only current workarounds, though neither is an ideal solution.
