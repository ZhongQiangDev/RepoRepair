Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pipeline operator with the "smart" syntax (|> # * 2) is causing a syntax error
**Cause**: Prettier 1.17.1 is only supporting the minimal/basic pipeline operator proposal, but not the smart pipeline operator proposal which uses the # symbol as a placeholder. The parser (babylon) doesn't recognize the # syntax as valid JavaScript.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: F# style pipeline operations are not supported
**Cause**: The current implementation only handles the basic pipeline proposal, while more advanced syntaxes like F#-style pipelines (which are more convenient for functional programming) are not implemented in the parser.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message is not descriptive enough about pipeline operator syntax support
**Cause**: The error message simply states "Unexpected character '#'" without explaining that this is related to an unsupported pipeline operator proposal, which could be confusing for developers trying to use the smart pipeline syntax.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around limited pipeline operator support in Prettier 1.17.1. The parser only implements the minimal pipeline proposal while excluding more advanced features like smart pipelines (using # as placeholder) and F#-style pipelines. This limitation causes syntax errors when trying to use these advanced features, and the error messaging could be more informative about the actual support status of different pipeline proposals. The problem essentially stems from a gap between the implemented specification and the desired functionality that developers want to use.
