Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prettier fails to format code blocks when language identifiers are followed by attributes
**Cause**: Prettier's parser is currently designed to only recognize the language identifier (e.g., `js`, `python`) and doesn't handle additional attributes that follow it. It stops processing when it encounters non-whitespace characters after the language identifier.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent formatting between code blocks with and without attributes
**Cause**: When Prettier encounters a code block with attributes (e.g., `{cmd=node .line-numbers}`), it doesn't recognize it as a valid language-specific code block, so it skips the formatting that would normally be applied to that language. This results in the code remaining unformatted while similar code blocks without attributes get properly formatted.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior across different markdown preview implementations
**Cause**: Different markdown processors and editors (Atom vs VSCode) handle the whitespace requirement between language identifier and attributes differently. For example, VSCode requires a space between language identifier and attributes (`js {cmd=true}`), while Atom works without the space (`js{cmd=true}`).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prettier's limited parsing of fenced code block headers. It currently doesn't support the extended syntax used by various markdown flavors that allow attributes after the language identifier. This leads to inconsistent formatting behavior and breaks compatibility with popular markdown extensions and editors. The parser needs to be modified to:
1. Recognize language identifiers even when followed by attributes
2. Ignore the attributes when determining the language for formatting purposes
3. Potentially standardize the handling of whitespace between language identifiers and attributes
