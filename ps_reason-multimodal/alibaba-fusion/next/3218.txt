Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent margin-bottom values appearing in multiple Select component demos
**Cause**: The CSS styles for margin-bottom are being defined multiple times with different values (8px and 16px) in different files (combobox-basic.md and select-basic.md), causing style conflicts and inconsistent spacing between components.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: CSS styles from one demo affecting other demos
**Cause**: The `.next-select` class styles are defined with absolute values without proper scoping, causing these styles to leak into other Select component demonstrations. This is evident in the CSS where margin-right and margin-bottom are set to 8px globally for `.next-select`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Demo layout appears broken or inconsistent
**Cause**: The combination of competing margin values and absolute positioning styles creates unintended spacing and alignment issues in the demo presentation. The styles are not properly isolated between different demo sections.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from CSS specificity and scoping problems in the Select component demos. The root causes are:
1. Conflicting margin-bottom values (8px vs 16px) defined in multiple files
2. Globally applied styles without proper component-specific scoping
3. Lack of CSS isolation between different demo sections

To fix these issues, the demo styles should be:
- Properly scoped to their specific demo sections
- Consistent in their margin values across different demos
- Isolated to prevent style leakage between different components
- Potentially using CSS modules or other CSS isolation techniques to prevent global style conflicts
