Based on the provided GitHub problem description and image, I'll analyze the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When using both fixedHeader and resizable features together in the Table component, the header's filter dropdown menu displays incorrectly, appearing out of alignment or position.
**Cause**: This is likely caused by a conflict between the positioning mechanisms of fixedHeader and resizable features. The fixedHeader feature uses absolute positioning for the header, while the resizable feature manipulates column widths. When both are active, the coordinate system for the filter dropdown menu may be calculated incorrectly, leading to misalignment.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The filter button's dropdown menu positioning doesn't account for the fixed header's offset.
**Cause**: The positioning calculation for the dropdown menu likely uses the default document flow positioning, without taking into account the fixed header's modified DOM structure and positioning context. This causes the dropdown to appear in an incorrect position relative to its trigger button.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from compatibility problems between the Table component's fixedHeader and resizable features, specifically affecting the positioning of filter dropdowns in the header. The root cause appears to be conflicting positioning mechanisms and incorrect coordinate calculations when these two features are used simultaneously. To fix this, the component needs to:
1. Properly handle the positioning context when both features are enabled
2. Adjust the dropdown menu positioning calculation to account for the fixed header's offset
3. Ensure the coordinate system remains consistent between the resizable columns and fixed header functionality

A potential solution would involve refactoring the positioning logic to properly account for both features' requirements and ensure they work harmoniously together.
