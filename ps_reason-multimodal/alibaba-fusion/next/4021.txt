Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker allows users to input values beyond the maximum limit
**Cause**: The input validation is only happening on blur (onBlur event) instead of during input (onChange event), allowing users to temporarily enter values larger than the maximum allowed value

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users can keep increasing the number while the price remains unchanged
**Cause**: The price calculation logic is not being triggered during input changes, and only updates when the field loses focus (onBlur), creating a misleading user experience

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of immediate feedback when users try to exceed the maximum value
**Cause**: The component doesn't implement real-time validation or visual indicators to warn users when they're attempting to exceed the maximum allowed value

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between displayed value and actual value
**Cause**: The auto-correction mechanism only works on blur, creating a temporary mismatch between what the user sees in the input field and the actual value that will be used

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from delayed validation that only occurs on the onBlur event rather than during input. This creates several user experience problems:
1. Users can temporarily enter invalid values
2. The price doesn't update in real-time with number changes
3. There's no immediate feedback about maximum value restrictions
4. The displayed value can be temporarily inconsistent with the actual value

The solution should implement immediate validation during onChange events, provide immediate feedback to users, and maintain consistency between displayed values and actual values at all times.
