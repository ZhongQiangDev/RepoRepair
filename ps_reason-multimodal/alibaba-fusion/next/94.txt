Let me analyze the problem with the NumberPicker component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker displays 4.029999 instead of 4.03 when incrementing from 4.02 by 0.01
**Cause**: This is caused by JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic precision limitation. JavaScript uses 64-bit floating-point numbers (IEEE 754), which can't precisely represent some decimal fractions. When performing arithmetic with decimals like 4.02 + 0.01, JavaScript internally produces 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The precision prop is not properly handling the floating-point rounding
**Cause**: Even though a precision={2} prop is specified, the NumberPicker component is not properly rounding the calculated value before display. It's showing the raw result of the floating-point calculation instead of applying the requested precision formatting.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is specifically reported in Safari browser
**Cause**: While floating-point arithmetic behavior is consistent across browsers (as it's part of the JavaScript specification), the display/rendering of these numbers might be handled differently by Safari compared to other browsers. Safari might be displaying more decimal places of the internal representation compared to other browsers that might automatically truncate or round the display.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from JavaScript's inherent floating-point precision limitations, which affects simple decimal arithmetic operations. This manifests in the NumberPicker component when incrementing decimal values. The component needs to implement proper rounding logic to handle these floating-point imprecisions, especially considering the specified precision prop. The fix should:
1. Properly round the calculated values to the specified precision
2. Handle JavaScript floating-point arithmetic limitations
3. Ensure consistent behavior across all browsers, particularly Safari
4. Consider using a decimal arithmetic library for precise calculations if absolute accuracy is required
