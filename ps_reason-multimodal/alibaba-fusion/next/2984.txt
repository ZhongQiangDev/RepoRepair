Based on the error message and description provided, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: CascaderSelect component is modifying props passed by the user directly, which causes an error when used with Immer
**Cause**: The component is attempting to add or modify properties on an object that is frozen/non-extensible, likely due to Immer's immutability requirements. This is evident from the error message "TypeError: Cannot add property value, object is not extensible"

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Improper state management in the Cascader component
**Cause**: The error stack trace shows the issue occurs in cascader.js during cache operations (setCache and updateCache methods), indicating the component is trying to mutate state directly instead of creating new state objects

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Violation of React's props immutability principle
**Cause**: React props should be treated as immutable, but the component is attempting to modify them directly instead of using proper state management through setState or similar methods

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the CascaderSelect component improperly handling data immutability. It's attempting to modify props directly, which violates both React's principles and causes conflicts with Immer's immutability enforcement. The component needs to be refactored to:
1. Never modify props directly
2. Use proper state management for any mutable data
3. Create new objects instead of modifying existing ones when working with Immer
4. Respect immutability principles throughout the component lifecycle

The fix would likely involve restructuring how the component handles its internal cache and state updates to ensure it creates new objects rather than modifying existing ones.
