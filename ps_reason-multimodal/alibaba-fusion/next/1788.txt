Let me analyze the TypeScript type error shown in the images.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TypeScript compiler shows type incompatibility error for the onBlur event handler
**Cause**: The type definition mismatch between what's being passed `(event: MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>) => void` and what's expected `() => void`. The component is expecting a simple callback function with no parameters, but the actual implementation is trying to use a MouseEvent parameter.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The type definition for onBlur is too restrictive
**Cause**: The current type definition `(): void` doesn't account for the event parameter that's commonly needed in blur event handlers. This is evident from the code showing both onFocus and onBlur with the same simplified type signature `(): void`, which doesn't match the actual event handling requirements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from a type definition conflict in the onBlur event handler. The component's type definition expects a parameter-less function returning void `() => void`, but the actual implementation needs to handle a MouseEvent parameter. To fix this, the type definition should be updated to accept the event parameter: `(event: FocusEvent) => void` or more specifically `(event: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>) => void` for React components. This would properly type both the event handler and maintain type safety while allowing access to the event object when needed.

The current simplified type definition is causing unnecessary restrictions and doesn't reflect the actual usage pattern of blur event handlers in React/TypeScript applications.
