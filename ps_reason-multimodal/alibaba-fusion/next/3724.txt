Based on the GitHub problem description and chat screenshots provided, I'll analyze the issue with the Transfer component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Transfer component only shows the search box on the left side, while the right side search box is not displayed.

**Cause**: The searchProps property of the Transfer component appears to be controlling both search boxes simultaneously, without the ability to configure them separately. This limits the flexibility to have different search behaviors or visibility settings for the left and right panels.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of independent control for search functionality between source and target lists.

**Cause**: The current implementation likely uses a single searchProps configuration that gets applied to both sides of the Transfer component. There's no mechanism to provide separate search configurations for the source and target lists.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the Transfer component's search functionality implementation. Currently, it lacks the ability to independently control the search boxes on both sides (source and target lists). The searchProps configuration appears to be applied globally to both sides, which prevents users from having different search behaviors or visibility settings for each side. A solution would be to modify the component to accept separate searchProps configurations for the left and right panels, allowing for more flexible and granular control of the search functionality.

The enhancement request is asking for the ability to configure search boxes independently, which would improve the component's flexibility and meet various use case requirements where different search behaviors are needed for source and target lists.
