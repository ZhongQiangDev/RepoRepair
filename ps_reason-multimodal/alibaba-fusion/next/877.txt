Based on the provided GitHub problem description and image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The overlay content is collapsing when the content is inline
**Cause**: The overlay wrapper lacks proper width specification, causing the content to collapse when there's no explicit width set for inline content

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The overlay positioning is not properly maintained
**Cause**: The CSS properties in the `.next-overlay-wrapper` class are incomplete. While it has `position: absolute`, `top: 0`, and `left: 0`, it needs additional styling to ensure proper layout containment

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Content rendering space limitation
**Cause**: Without `width: 100%` specification, the browser doesn't have a defined space to render the inline content, leading to collapse issues

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from inadequate CSS specifications for the overlay component. The problems primarily revolve around:
1. Missing width property causing inline content collapse
2. Incomplete positioning properties for proper overlay placement
3. Lack of proper space allocation for content rendering

The solution, as mentioned in the description, is to add `width: 100%` to the overlay wrapper, which will provide the necessary space for the browser to render inline content correctly and prevent collapse issues. This fix ensures proper content display and maintains the intended overlay functionality.
