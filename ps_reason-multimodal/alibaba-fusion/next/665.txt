Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided image, I'll analyze the problems and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The header cell's checkbox appears to be misaligned or improperly styled in the table header
**Cause**: The custom header cell implementation likely doesn't properly handle the checkbox component's styling and alignment within the header cell container

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text "未设置" (Not Set) appears multiple times in different rows without proper formatting
**Cause**: The table's default cell rendering mechanism isn't properly handling the custom cell content, resulting in inconsistent display of placeholder text

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The column widths appear uneven or not optimally distributed
**Cause**: Missing or improper column width configurations in the table component implementation

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The hierarchical structure indicated by the leftmost column's indentation appears incomplete or inconsistent
**Cause**: The tree-table functionality that handles parent-child relationships and indentation levels isn't properly implemented for custom header cells

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around improper implementation of custom header cells in the table component, particularly affecting:
1. Checkbox alignment and styling in header cells
2. Consistent formatting of cell content
3. Column width distribution
4. Hierarchical structure display

The root cause appears to be insufficient handling of custom cell content within the table component's header implementation, requiring improvements to the component's customization capabilities and layout management.
