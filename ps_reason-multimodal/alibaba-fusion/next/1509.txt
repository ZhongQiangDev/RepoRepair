Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Dialog component's popup container is not respecting the ConfigProvider's popupContainer setting, causing positioning issues.
**Cause**: The Dialog component likely has its own container handling logic that overrides or ignores the ConfigProvider's popupContainer configuration. This creates inconsistency with other components that do respect this setting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Dialog appears to be rendered at the wrong layer/level in the DOM hierarchy
**Cause**: By default, Dialog components are often rendered at the document.body level for proper modal behavior. However, when used within a ConfigProvider with a custom container, this default behavior needs to be modified to respect the configured container context.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Z-index and stacking context issues are visible in the screenshot, where the dialog's overlay and content may not be properly layered
**Cause**: When the Dialog is rendered outside its intended container (as specified in ConfigProvider), it can create separate stacking contexts that don't properly interact with other elements in the application.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the Dialog component not properly integrating with ConfigProvider's popupContainer setting. This causes three main problems: container management inconsistency, incorrect DOM rendering hierarchy, and z-index/stacking context conflicts. To fix this, the Dialog component needs to be modified to respect the ConfigProvider's popupContainer setting, similar to how other components handle this configuration. This would ensure consistent behavior across all components and prevent positioning and layering issues.
