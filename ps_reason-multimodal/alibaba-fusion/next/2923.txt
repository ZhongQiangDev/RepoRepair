Let me analyze the problem and its causes based on the provided GitHub issue description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Memory leak in ConfigProvider component during Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
**Cause**: 
- The ConfigProvider component has an internal cache mechanism
- The cache cleanup is implemented in componentWillUnmount lifecycle method
- During SSR, componentWillUnmount is not executed (as documented in React Issue #3714)
- This results in the cache continuously growing without being garbage collected

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No manual cache cleanup mechanism available
**Cause**:
- The current implementation only relies on React's lifecycle method for cache cleanup
- There's no exposed API or alternative method to manually clear the cache
- This becomes problematic especially in SSR scenarios where automatic cleanup fails

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inefficient cache management strategy
**Cause**:
- The current caching strategy appears to create new cache entries for each instance of ConfigProvider
- As shown in the memory snapshot, multiple instances of ConfigProvider are being created (@3653969, @2788589, etc.)
- Without proper cleanup, these cache entries accumulate over time

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a memory leak in the ConfigProvider component during SSR scenarios. This occurs because:
1. The cache cleanup relies solely on componentWillUnmount which doesn't execute in SSR
2. There's no alternative mechanism to clear the cache manually
3. The caching strategy creates multiple entries that accumulate over time

To resolve these issues, potential solutions could include:
- Implementing a manual cache cleanup API
- Redesigning the caching strategy to be more SSR-friendly
- Adding alternative cleanup mechanisms that don't rely on React lifecycle methods
