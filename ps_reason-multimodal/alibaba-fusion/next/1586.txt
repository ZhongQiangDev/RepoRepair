Let me analyze the Tree component issue based on the provided information and images:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The selected state of tree nodes doesn't toggle properly after the first click. Once a node is deselected (false), subsequent clicks don't change its state anymore.
**Cause**: In the onCategoryTreeNodeSelect function, the state setting logic is flawed. The current implementation only sets selectedCategoryId to either the first selected key or undefined, but doesn't properly maintain the toggle state.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The CSS styles for selected/unselected states don't update properly with node selection changes.
**Cause**: The visual state is likely not being properly synchronized with the actual selected state because the component isn't re-rendering when the selected state changes, or the CSS classes aren't being properly applied based on the current state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The selected state in extra parameter is not being properly updated after the first change.
**Cause**: Looking at the code, the extra.selected value is only being used to determine the initial state, but there's no logic to update this value when the selection changes. The state management is one-way instead of bi-directional.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from incomplete state management in the Tree component:
1. The selection toggle logic is broken after first deselection due to improper state updates in onCategoryTreeNodeSelect
2. The visual feedback system isn't properly connected to the selection state
3. The extra.selected parameter isn't being maintained throughout the component lifecycle

To fix these issues, the component needs:
- Proper toggle state management that maintains the selected state
- Consistent synchronization between the internal state and visual representation
- Better handling of the extra.selected parameter to maintain bi-directional state updates

The code should be modified to properly toggle the selectedCategoryId between the selected value and undefined, while also ensuring the visual states and extra parameters are updated accordingly.
