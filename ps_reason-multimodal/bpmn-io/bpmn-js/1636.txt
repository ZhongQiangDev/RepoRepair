Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When morphing a call activity to a subprocess, the resulting subprocess appears too small and looks similar to a regular task
**Cause**: The morphing transformation logic doesn't properly adjust the size of the resulting subprocess element to make it visually distinct from a regular task

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The morphed subprocess lacks a start event node, which should be automatically added
**Cause**: The morphing transformation logic doesn't include the automatic creation and placement of a start event node, unlike when morphing from a regular task to a subprocess

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent morphing behavior between different element types
**Cause**: The morphing implementation treats the call activity to subprocess transformation differently from task to subprocess transformation, leading to inconsistent results and poor user experience

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the subprocess morphing functionality, specifically when transforming from a call activity. The problems include:
1. Inadequate visual representation (size) of the resulting subprocess
2. Missing automatic start event node creation
3. Inconsistent behavior compared to other element transformations

These issues appear to stem from incomplete or inconsistent implementation of the morphing logic specifically for call activity to subprocess transformation. The solution would require updating the morphing behavior to:
- Properly resize the resulting subprocess
- Automatically add a start event
- Ensure consistent behavior across all element transformations
