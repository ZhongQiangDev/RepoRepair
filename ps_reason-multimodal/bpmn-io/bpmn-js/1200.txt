Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF and XML code, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The conditionExpression is being removed from the sequence flow when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is dropped on it.
**Cause**: The event handling logic for dropping a Timer Intermediate Catch Event likely overwrites or fails to preserve the existing sequence flow properties, specifically the conditionExpression element.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The modification of one element (adding Timer event) unexpectedly affects another element's properties (sequence flow condition).
**Cause**: There appears to be a flaw in the element modification logic where the sequence flow reconstruction or update process doesn't maintain all original properties when splitting the flow to accommodate the new intermediate event.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The XML structure shows that the conditionExpression (model:conditionExpression) is a child element of sequenceFlow, but this parent-child relationship is not being maintained during the Timer event insertion.
**Cause**: The implementation likely creates new sequence flow segments when splitting the original flow, but fails to copy or transfer the condition expression properties from the original sequence flow to the appropriate new segment.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of existing sequence flow properties during the Timer Intermediate Catch Event insertion process. The main technical problem is that the library's flow-splitting mechanism doesn't preserve the conditionExpression when creating new sequence flow segments. This appears to be a bug in the element modification logic that needs to be fixed by ensuring all relevant properties, especially conditions, are preserved when modifying flow elements. The fix should focus on maintaining the integrity of sequence flow properties during any flow-splitting or modification operations.
