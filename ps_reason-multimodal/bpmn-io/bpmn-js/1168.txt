Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and GIF demonstration.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Direct editing is automatically activated for the task element in the first position after pasting multiple elements
**Cause**: The paste operation is likely triggering the direct editing behavior specifically for task elements, even though a previous fix (issue #1152) attempted to resolve this by selecting all elements after pasting. The selection mechanism isn't properly preventing the direct editing activation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is specific to task elements in the first position
**Cause**: There appears to be special handling for task elements in the BPMN-js library that differs from other element types. When a task element is in the first position of the pasted elements, it's triggering an automatic direct editing behavior that doesn't occur with other element types in the same position.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The previous fix (selecting all elements after paste) is not effectively preventing the direct editing behavior
**Cause**: The implementation of the multi-selection after paste (from issue #1152) is not properly intercepting or canceling the direct editing trigger. This suggests there might be a timing issue where the direct editing activation occurs before or overrides the multi-selection behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around unexpected automatic direct editing activation after pasting multiple BPMN elements. The problem specifically manifests when a task element is in the first position of the pasted elements, indicating special handling for task elements that needs to be modified. While a previous attempt was made to fix this by selecting all elements after pasting, the solution was not completely effective, suggesting either a timing issue in the implementation or that the direct editing trigger needs to be explicitly disabled during paste operations. The fix should focus on preventing direct editing activation during paste operations, regardless of the element type or position.
