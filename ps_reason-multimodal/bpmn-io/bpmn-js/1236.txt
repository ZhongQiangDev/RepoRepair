Based on the provided GIF and problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The subprocess container expands horizontally when converted to an Ad Hoc Subprocess
**Cause**: The conversion to Ad Hoc Subprocess likely triggers a recalculation of the container dimensions without properly considering the collapsed state, causing unnecessary horizontal expansion.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The subprocess maintains an inconsistent width compared to its original collapsed state
**Cause**: The dimension handling logic for Ad Hoc Subprocess conversion doesn't properly preserve the original collapsed dimensions, suggesting a bug in the resize/collapse handling code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual transition during conversion is abrupt and unexpected
**Cause**: The absence of proper transition handling during the conversion process from regular subprocess to Ad Hoc subprocess, particularly when dealing with collapsed state dimensions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around improper dimension handling when converting a collapsed subprocess to an Ad Hoc subprocess. The problem manifests in three ways: unexpected horizontal expansion, inconsistent width preservation, and abrupt visual transitions. These issues likely stem from bugs in the dimension calculation logic specific to Ad Hoc subprocess conversion, particularly when dealing with collapsed states. The code needs to be modified to maintain consistent dimensions during type conversion while preserving the collapsed state properties.
