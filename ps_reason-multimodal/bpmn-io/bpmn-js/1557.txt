Based on the provided GitHub problem description and error stack trace, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TypeError exception when attempting to morph a DataStoreReference to DataObjectReference outside of a Pool
**Cause**: The error occurs in the BpmnUpdater.js file when trying to update the DI parent (diagram interchange parent) of the morphed element. The "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get')" error suggests that the code is trying to access a property of an undefined parent object, likely because the element is not properly contained within a Pool structure.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The application allows morphing of DataStoreReference to DataObjectReference outside of Pool when it potentially shouldn't
**Cause**: There appears to be missing validation logic that should either:
1. Prevent the morphing operation when the element is outside a Pool
2. Handle the case properly when morphing is performed outside a Pool

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incomplete error handling for invalid morphing operations
**Cause**: The code doesn't properly handle edge cases where morphing operations are performed in invalid contexts, leading to uncaught exceptions rather than graceful error handling or user feedback.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of BPMN element morphing outside of valid contexts. There are three main problems:
1. A technical implementation issue where parent references are not properly handled during morphing
2. A validation gap that allows potentially invalid operations
3. Poor error handling that results in application crashes

The fix would likely require either:
- Adding validation to prevent morphing DataStoreReference to DataObjectReference outside of Pools
- Implementing proper parent reference handling for elements outside of Pools
- Adding proper error handling to gracefully handle invalid morphing attempts

The most appropriate solution would depend on the intended business rules for BPMN modeling in this context.
