Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided GIFs, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to create center-to-center connections between tasks easily in the new version
**Cause**: The introduction of connection previews and grid snapping features has altered the connection behavior, making it more difficult to establish direct center-to-center connections between tasks. The new snapping mechanism appears to be prioritizing edge points over center points.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing basic center-to-center snapping functionality
**Cause**: The new implementation of the connection system seems to have overlooked or deprioritized the center snapping points in favor of other connection points (like edges and corners). This makes it harder to achieve what was previously a common and straightforward operation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent connection behavior between old and new versions
**Cause**: The change in the connection preview and snapping system has fundamentally altered the user interaction model. While the old version allowed for intuitive center-to-center connections, the new version's connection logic appears to be more complex and less predictable for this specific use case.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from changes introduced in version 4.0.0-beta.1 related to connection previews and grid snapping. These changes have inadvertently made it more difficult to create center-to-center connections between tasks, which is considered a fundamental and common operation in BPMN modeling. The main problems are:
1. Loss of easy center-to-center connection capability
2. Missing basic center snapping functionality
3. A less intuitive connection behavior compared to previous versions

The solution would likely involve rebalancing the priority of center connection points while maintaining the benefits of the new connection preview and grid snapping features.
