Based on the provided GitHub issue and the demonstration GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Boundary Events remain as boundary events when moved away from their host element in a batch operation
**Cause**: The event transformation logic that converts boundary events to intermediate events is not being triggered during batch movement operations. This suggests the transformation logic is only implemented for single-event movements rather than handling multiple selections.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual connection between the boundary events and their original host remains after moving
**Cause**: The attachment/detachment mechanism isn't properly handling batch operations, causing the visual and logical connections to persist when they should be removed during the move operation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The system allows an invalid BPMN state to exist
**Cause**: There's insufficient validation logic to either:
1. Prevent invalid operations (moving boundary events away from their host in batch)
2. Or automatically correct the state (converting to intermediate events)
when batch operations are performed

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete handling of batch operations in the BPMN editor. While the system correctly handles single boundary event movements by converting them to intermediate events, this functionality breaks down during batch operations. This results in three main problems: failure to transform event types, persistent invalid connections, and allowing invalid BPMN states. The solution would require either implementing proper event transformation logic for batch operations or disallowing batch movement of boundary events altogether to maintain diagram validity.
