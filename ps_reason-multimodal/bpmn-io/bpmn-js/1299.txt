Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Elements (events and gateways) become smaller than normal when selected
**Cause**: This issue appears to be introduced after upgrading from version 6.3.0 to 6.3.3, specifically linked to the commit e4e789b. The change in element sizing behavior seems to be related to how the selection handling was modified in this version.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Gateway elements completely disappear when clicked
**Cause**: The selection handling in version 6.3.3 appears to be incorrectly managing the visibility or rendering properties of gateway elements when they receive focus/selection events.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Elements become non-clickable after size reduction
**Cause**: The size reduction of elements likely affects their clickable area or hit-box, making them impossible to interact with after the initial selection.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Empty label editing causes elements to resize to minimum bounds
**Cause**: The direct editing completion handler isn't properly managing element dimensions when the label is empty, causing it to collapse to minimum bounds instead of maintaining appropriate dimensions.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Issue occurs only with direct selection but not with Lasso Tool selection
**Cause**: This indicates the problem is specifically tied to the direct element selection handler, while the Lasso Tool uses a different selection mechanism that doesn't trigger the same sizing issues.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues revolve around improper element sizing and rendering handling introduced in version 6.3.3. The problems manifest in multiple ways: elements shrinking, becoming non-interactive, or disappearing entirely when selected directly. The root cause appears to be changes in the selection handling code (commit e4e789b) that incorrectly modifies element properties upon selection. The fact that the Lasso Tool works correctly suggests the issue is specifically in the direct selection handler rather than a general rendering problem. Additionally, there's a separate but related issue with empty label handling causing incorrect element resizing.
