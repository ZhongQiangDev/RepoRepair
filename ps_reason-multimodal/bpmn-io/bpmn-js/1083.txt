Based on the provided GitHub problem description and GIFs, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The docking point snapping functionality is completely missing in v4-beta when moving elements, whereas it worked properly in v3.x
**Cause**: This is likely due to either:
1. The snapping feature code was removed or disabled during the v4 beta upgrade
2. The docking points detection logic has been broken in the new version
3. The event handlers for element movement and snapping are not properly connected in v4-beta

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Elements can be placed anywhere without alignment guides or snapping assistance
**Cause**: The underlying snap-to-grid or snap-to-element functionality appears to have been:
1. Disconnected from the element movement handlers
2. The snapping calculation logic may have changed or been removed
3. The visual feedback system for showing potential snap points is not functioning

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No visual indicators appear when elements are near valid docking points
**Cause**: The visual feedback system for docking points has likely been:
1. Removed from the rendering pipeline in v4-beta
2. The docking point highlight/preview system is not being triggered
3. The connection between movement events and visual feedback is broken

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the complete loss of docking point snapping functionality in the v4-beta version, which was working correctly in v3.x. This appears to be a regression that affects both the functional aspect (actual snapping) and visual feedback (showing possible snap points). The root cause likely stems from significant changes in the codebase during the v3.x to v4-beta transition, where the snapping system was either intentionally removed, accidentally disabled, or broken due to architectural changes. This needs to be addressed by either restoring the previous snapping implementation or creating a new one that maintains the same functionality as v3.x.
