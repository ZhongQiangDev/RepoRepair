Let me analyze the problem based on the provided description and GIF demonstration:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The empty pool's height changes when using the space tool, which should not happen according to BPMN specifications.
**Cause**: The space tool's implementation likely treats the empty pool as a regular resizable element, without checking for the special case of empty pools which should maintain a fixed height.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The space tool affects the empty pool's vertical dimensions despite empty pools having a dedicated, fixed height shape.
**Cause**: There appears to be missing validation logic in the space tool's handler that should prevent vertical resizing operations on empty pools while still allowing horizontal adjustments if needed.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual distinction between empty pools and lanes/expanded pools is compromised when using the space tool.
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't preserve the special rendering rules for empty pools, which are supposed to have a distinct visual appearance with fixed height to differentiate them from other BPMN elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the space tool not properly handling empty pools as special cases in the BPMN notation. Empty pools should maintain a fixed height to distinguish them from lanes and expanded pools, but the current implementation allows vertical resizing. This appears to be caused by:
1. Lack of special case handling for empty pools
2. Missing validation checks in the space tool's resize logic
3. Incorrect treatment of empty pools as standard resizable elements

To fix this, the space tool needs to be modified to recognize empty pools and prevent vertical resizing while maintaining their fixed height property.
