Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided BPMN diagram, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The append shortcut 'a' is not working on elements that should support appending but don't have an append menu.
**Cause**: The implementation likely checks for the presence of append menu options before allowing the append action, instead of checking if the element type supports appending in general.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The fallback behavior (create) is not triggered when append is not possible.
**Cause**: The shortcut handler appears to be strictly tied to the append functionality without proper fallback logic to the create action when append is not available.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between different element types in the BPMN diagram.
**Cause**: The shortcut implementation might be checking for specific element types or conditions rather than following the general design principle that 'a' should always trigger either append or create actions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from an implementation that's too restrictive in handling the 'a' shortcut. Instead of following the design principle where 'a' should always be available (either for append or create), the current implementation appears to be dependent on the presence of an append menu. This creates inconsistent behavior across different element types and fails to provide the expected fallback to create action when append is not possible. The solution would likely involve restructuring the shortcut handler to first check if append is possible for the element type, and if not, default to the create action, regardless of the presence of an append menu.
