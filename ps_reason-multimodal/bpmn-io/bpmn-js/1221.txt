Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The label position of boundary events is not properly aligned after copy-pasting operations in the flow diagram
**Cause**: The AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior is not being triggered or reapplied to newly pasted elements. This suggests that the copy-paste operation is not properly invoking the behavior registration for new elements.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The vertical alignment of labels is lost specifically when pasting into flows with vertical direction
**Cause**: The flow direction context information is not being preserved or re-evaluated during the paste operation. The positioning behavior needs to consider the parent flow's direction when calculating label positions for pasted elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The positioning behavior is working for original elements but not for copied ones
**Cause**: This suggests an initialization issue where the behavior registration process is tied to element creation but not to element copying. The copy operation likely creates a new element instance without properly transferring or re-initializing the associated behaviors.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior not being properly handled during copy-paste operations. This manifests in three main ways: failure to apply the behavior to pasted elements, loss of vertical alignment in vertical flows, and inconsistency between original and copied elements. The root cause appears to be in the behavior registration mechanism, which needs to be extended to handle copy-paste operations properly, ensuring that all necessary behaviors and contextual information are preserved or properly re-initialized for pasted elements.

To fix this, the implementation would need to:
1. Ensure behavior registration occurs for pasted elements
2. Preserve flow direction context during copy-paste
3. Properly transfer or re-initialize positioning behaviors for copied elements
