Let me analyze the problem based on the provided description and images:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: External labels are being set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color when using the `modeling.setColor` API
**Cause**: The color setting logic in the `modeling.setColor` API is likely not differentiating between external and embedded labels, causing it to incorrectly apply the fill color property to external labels instead of the stroke color property.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between external and embedded label color handling
**Cause**: The implementation appears to have different color application logic for external vs embedded labels, where embedded labels correctly use the stroke color while external labels incorrectly use the fill color. This suggests a lack of unified color handling logic between the two label types.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor visibility of external labels due to light fill color
**Cause**: Since the external labels are using the fill color (which tends to be lighter) instead of the stroke color (which tends to be darker), this creates a UX issue where the external labels may be difficult to read against light backgrounds.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from incorrect color property assignment for external labels in the `modeling.setColor` API. While embedded labels correctly use the stroke color, external labels are erroneously using the fill color instead. This not only creates an inconsistency in the application's behavior but also leads to potential usability issues due to poor contrast when light fill colors are used. The fix would likely involve modifying the color setting logic to ensure external labels consistently use the stroke color property, matching the behavior of embedded labels.

The problem appears to be isolated to cases where color is applied specifically to the label (not when applied to the target shape), suggesting the issue lies in the label-specific color handling logic rather than the general color application system.
