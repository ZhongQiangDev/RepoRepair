Based on the provided GitHub problem description and GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The XML label is not updating when toggling between Parallel and Sequential modes in the multi-instance loop.
**Cause**: There appears to be a bug in the event handling or state management system that's not properly triggering the XML label update when the user switches between Parallel and Sequential modes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The isSequential attribute is not being added/removed in the XML representation when toggling the modes.
**Cause**: The component responsible for generating the BPMN XML output is likely not properly connected to the UI state changes, causing it to miss updates when the multi-instance loop characteristics are modified.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual feedback in the UI doesn't reflect the current state of the multi-instance loop configuration.
**Cause**: There might be a disconnect between the UI component state and the underlying data model, preventing proper synchronization between what's shown in the interface and the actual BPMN configuration.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around a synchronization problem between the UI interactions and the XML representation of the BPMN diagram. When users toggle between Parallel and Sequential modes in a multi-instance loop, the system fails to update the XML label accordingly. This appears to be caused by:
1. Broken event handling for mode toggles
2. Improper connection between UI state and XML generation
3. Missing state synchronization between the visual interface and the underlying data model

To fix these issues, the development team should:
- Implement proper event handling for mode toggles
- Ensure the XML generator responds to UI state changes
- Establish proper state management between UI and data model components
