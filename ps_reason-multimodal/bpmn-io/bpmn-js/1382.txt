Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The DataObjectReference replace menu appears empty with only the collection marker option
**Cause**: Limited functionality in the current implementation where the replace menu doesn't include other relevant reference types like DataStoreReference

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inability to convert between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference
**Cause**: Missing feature implementation for converting/switching between different reference types in the system

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incomplete menu options for data handling
**Cause**: DataObjectInputs/Outputs functionality hasn't been implemented yet, leading to a sparse menu with limited options

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around an underdeveloped reference replacement menu system. The menu currently only shows a collection marker option, making it feel incomplete and limiting its utility. The lack of ability to convert between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference types, combined with pending DataObjectInputs/Outputs implementation, results in a suboptimal user experience. Adding the ability to switch between reference types would provide more functionality and make the menu more useful until the full data handling features are implemented.
