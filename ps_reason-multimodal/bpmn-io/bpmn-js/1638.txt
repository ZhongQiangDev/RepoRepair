Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and image:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `label` property remains in the task object with a `null` value even after clearing/removing the label
**Cause**: This appears to be related to how the property handling was implemented when adding support for embedded label DIs (Diagram Interchange). Instead of completely removing the property when the label is cleared, the code is setting it to `null` while maintaining the property in the object structure.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Linting tools are reporting errors due to the presence of null label property
**Cause**: The linting tools expect the label property to be completely absent when there is no label, rather than having a null value. This incompatibility was introduced with the embedded label DIs support implementation (referenced issue #1540).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between expected data structure and actual implementation
**Cause**: The implementation doesn't align with the expected behavior where removing a label should result in complete removal of the label property from the data structure, not just nullifying it.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper property cleanup when removing labels from tasks in the BPMN editor. Instead of completely removing the `label` property, the current implementation sets it to `null`, which causes compatibility issues with linting tools and deviates from the expected behavior. This was introduced as a side effect of adding support for embedded label DIs. The fix would require modifying the property handling logic to completely remove the label property when a label is cleared, rather than setting it to null.
