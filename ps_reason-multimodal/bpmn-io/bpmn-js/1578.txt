Based on the provided GitHub problem description and the XML snippet, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate Process IDs in the BPMN XML
**Cause**: When copying and pasting a Pool, the system is not generating unique Process IDs. Both processes have the same ID "Process_17iojvx", which violates XML uniqueness constraints and BPMN specifications.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate Pool creation leads to export/import issues
**Cause**: The copy-paste operation is not properly handling the creation of new unique identifiers for all elements within the copied Pool structure, including the Process and its contained elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Task IDs are different but contained within processes with the same ID
**Cause**: While the system correctly generates new IDs for Tasks (Activity_0mkgwx2 vs Activity_1xz8h8p), it fails to do the same for the parent Process container, creating an inconsistent state where unique child elements exist under duplicate parent identifiers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete identifier management during the Pool copy-paste operation. The system needs to:
1. Generate new unique Process IDs when copying Pools
2. Ensure all contained elements (both the Pool and its contents) receive new unique identifiers
3. Maintain proper parent-child relationships with unique identifiers throughout the hierarchy
4. Implement proper validation before allowing export operations

This appears to be a fundamental issue in the copy-paste functionality that needs to be addressed at the ID generation and management level to ensure BPMN specification compliance and proper export/import functionality.
