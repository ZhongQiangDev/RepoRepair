I'll analyze the GitHub problem description following the requested format.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGLTileLayer becomes black when removed and re-added to the map specifically when using a palette-based style
**Cause**: The WebGL context is being lost or mismanaged when the layer is removed and re-added. The texture objects created for the palette are becoming invalid because they're tied to a specific WebGL context that's no longer valid after the layer removal.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGL warnings/errors in console about texture binding and context mismatch
**Cause**: The WebGL textures created for the palette are not being properly cleaned up or recreated when the layer is removed and re-added. This results in attempts to use texture objects that belong to a previous, now-invalid WebGL context.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only occurs with palette-based styles, while regular styles work fine
**Cause**: The palette feature likely requires special texture handling in WebGL that isn't being properly managed in the layer removal/addition lifecycle. The standard styles might use simpler WebGL operations that don't rely on preserved texture states.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from WebGL context and texture management problems specifically related to palette-based styles in WebGLTileLayer. When the layer is removed and re-added, the WebGL textures used for the palette become invalid because they're tied to a previous context. This results in black layers and WebGL errors. The problem doesn't affect regular styles, suggesting the issue is specifically related to how palette textures are handled during layer lifecycle events. Proper cleanup and recreation of WebGL resources during layer removal and addition would likely resolve these issues.
