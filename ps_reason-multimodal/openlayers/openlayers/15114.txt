Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Color overlap/darker shading in polygon fills when using WebGL layer
**Cause**: The WebGL renderer appears to be drawing the fill color multiple times for linear rings within the polygon, causing color accumulation where paths overlap. This is different from the traditional vector layer behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent rendering between valid and invalid GeoJSON
**Cause**: The WebGL implementation seems to handle polygon winding order (clockwise/counterclockwise) differently from the standard vector layer. Valid GeoJSON (according to spec) shows issues while invalid GeoJSON renders correctly, suggesting a potential mismatch between the WebGL rendering logic and GeoJSON spec implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Hole/interior ring rendering issues
**Cause**: The WebGL layer appears to be treating interior rings (holes) the same as exterior rings, not respecting the GeoJSON specification's rules about interior ring orientation. This relates to the Right-hand rule in GeoJSON 3.1.6 specification where exterior rings should be counterclockwise and interior rings clockwise.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Different behavior between WebGL and Vector layers for the same data
**Cause**: The WebGL implementation likely has a different polygon filling algorithm compared to the standard vector layer, particularly in how it handles multiple rings and winding order. The vector layer seems more forgiving of GeoJSON orientation rules.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from how the WebGL layer handles polygon rendering, particularly with respect to:
1. Multiple fill passes causing color accumulation
2. Different interpretation of polygon winding order compared to standard vector layers
3. Incorrect handling of interior/exterior ring orientation
4. Inconsistent implementation of GeoJSON specification rules

The problem appears to be primarily in the WebGL layer's implementation rather than the GeoJSON data itself, as the same data renders correctly in traditional vector layers. A solution would likely involve adjusting how the WebGL renderer handles polygon fill operations and ring orientation.
