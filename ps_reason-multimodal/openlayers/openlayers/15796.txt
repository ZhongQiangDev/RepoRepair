Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Vector layers with both `declutter` and `opacity < 1` settings are not clearing previous renders when the map is panned
**Cause**: There appears to be a rendering conflict between the declutter functionality (which manages feature overlap) and the opacity setting. When these are combined, the layer's clearing mechanism between frame renders is not functioning properly, leading to a visual artifact where previous frames remain visible.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual artifacts/ghosting effect during map navigation
**Cause**: The rendering pipeline is likely not properly handling the composite operations when both decluttering and transparency are active. Each render cycle should clear the previous frame before drawing the new one, but this clearing step appears to be skipped or ineffective under these specific conditions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Accumulation of rendered features across multiple frames
**Cause**: The layer's render buffer or canvas context might not be properly reset between render cycles when dealing with semi-transparent decluttered features. This suggests a potential issue in the layer's render management system when handling these specific property combinations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an interaction between two VectorLayer properties: `declutter` and `opacity`. When both are used together (specifically with opacity < 1), the layer's rendering system fails to properly clear previous frames, resulting in visual artifacts and feature accumulation during map navigation. This appears to be a regression in the rendering pipeline that needs to be addressed by ensuring proper frame clearing and context management when these properties are combined.

The issue is particularly noticeable during map panning operations, suggesting that the render cycle management needs to be reviewed and fixed specifically for this combination of layer properties.
