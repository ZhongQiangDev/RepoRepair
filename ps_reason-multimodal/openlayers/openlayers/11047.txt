Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Web workers created by the raster source are not being terminated when they're no longer needed
**Cause**: The pixelworks library, which is used by OpenLayers for raster operations, creates web workers but lacks proper cleanup mechanisms to terminate these workers when they're no longer required or when the source changes

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Memory usage increases over time as more workers accumulate
**Cause**: Each time the input number changes, new web workers are created but the old ones remain active, leading to a growing collection of unused workers consuming memory resources

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No built-in worker management system
**Cause**: OpenLayers' raster source implementation doesn't include a proper worker lifecycle management system that would handle the creation, tracking, and termination of workers automatically

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Need to use hacky solutions to prevent memory leaks
**Cause**: The lack of proper API or methods to access and manage the workers forces developers to use unofficial/internal properties (rasterSource.B.we) which is fragile and could break with version updates

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from inadequate worker lifecycle management in OpenLayers' raster source implementation. This leads to multiple problems: unterminated workers, memory leaks, and the need for hacky solutions. The workers created by pixelworks continue to exist even when they're no longer needed, forcing developers to implement manual termination using potentially unstable internal properties. This issue particularly impacts applications where the raster source frequently updates, as each update potentially creates new workers without cleaning up the old ones.
