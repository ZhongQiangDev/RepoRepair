Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Applications can only support up to 16 WebGL TileLayers simultaneously
**Cause**: Each WebGL TileLayer requires its own WebGL context, and browsers have a hard limit of typically 16 WebGL contexts. This is particularly problematic when rendering multiple raster images, as each GeoTIFFSource with distinct dimensions and positions needs its own context.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Application breaks down or misbehaves when the WebGL context limit is reached
**Cause**: When new WebGL contexts are needed beyond the limit, browsers automatically remove older WebGL contexts to stay within the hard limit. This forced removal of contexts disrupts the functionality of existing TileLayers that were using those contexts.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inefficient use of WebGL contexts when displaying multiple GeoTIFF images
**Cause**: The current implementation cannot combine GeoTIFFs unless they share the exact same dimensions and position, leading to unnecessary creation of separate WebGL contexts for images that could potentially be rendered together.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from OpenLayers' current architecture where each WebGL TileLayer requires its own WebGL context. This design runs into browser limitations (16 context maximum), causing three main problems: limited simultaneous TileLayer support, application instability when context limits are reached, and inefficient context usage for multiple GeoTIFF images. The proposed solution of sharing a single WebGL context among TileLayers within one OpenLayers map would significantly reduce the likelihood of hitting these limitations while maintaining functionality.
