Let me analyze the problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WMTS layer (EPSG:2180) appears rotated when using proj4js 2.6.1 with Mercator projection view
**Cause**: The rotation issue appears to be caused by a compatibility problem between OpenLayers 6.3.2-dev and proj4js 2.6.1's new axis order interpretation. The change in proj4js 2.6.1 regarding axis order interpretation is affecting how the EPSG:2180 coordinates are transformed to Mercator projection.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: OSM layer (Mercator) appears rotated when using proj4js 2.6.1 with EPSG:2180 projection view
**Cause**: Similar to Answer 1, this is the reverse scenario where the base Mercator projection layer is being incorrectly transformed due to the axis order interpretation changes in proj4js 2.6.1. The transformation between Mercator and EPSG:2180 is not handling the axis order correctly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Version compatibility constraints between OpenLayers and proj4js
**Cause**: The issue specifically appears with proj4js versions 2.6.1 and above, while working correctly with version 2.6.0. This suggests that the "Fixed interpretation of axis order" change in proj4js 2.6.1 introduced breaking changes that affect OpenLayers' projection transformation system.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from proj4js 2.6.1's changes to axis order interpretation, which causes rotation problems when transforming between different coordinate systems (specifically between Mercator and EPSG:2180). The problem manifests in two ways: rotated WMTS layers when using Mercator projection view, and rotated OSM layers when using EPSG:2180 projection view. The issue is version-specific, working correctly with proj4js 2.6.0 but breaking with 2.6.1 and above, indicating a need for either a compatibility fix in OpenLayers or a rollback to proj4js 2.6.0 until the issue is resolved.
