Let me analyze the problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The projected image shows 7x5 pixels instead of maintaining the original 5x5 pixel count
**Cause**: OpenLayers is forcing square pixels in the target projection, which causes the system to add additional pixels to maintain square shapes rather than allowing rectangular pixels. This leads to pixel duplication, particularly visible in the first column being repeated twice.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Horizontal misalignment between expected pixel centers (blue circles) and actual pixel positions
**Cause**: The reprojection algorithm assumes pixels must be square in the target projection (Web Mercator), even though the source pixels cover rectangular areas (3km x 2km) in the source projection (Lambert Conformal Conic). This assumption prevents proper alignment with the expected center points.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Distortion of the original pixel aspect ratio
**Cause**: The reprojection process doesn't preserve the original pixel dimensions and their proportions during transformation. Instead of allowing pixels to become rectangular in the target projection (which would maintain proper geographic coverage), it forces them into squares, leading to distortion of the original data representation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from OpenLayers' raster reprojection algorithm making the assumption that pixels must be square in the target projection. This assumption leads to three main problems: incorrect pixel count in the output, misalignment with expected geographic positions, and distortion of the original pixel proportions. The system needs to be modified to allow for non-square pixels in the target projection to maintain accurate geographic representation and preserve the original pixel count. This is particularly important when dealing with data where pixels represent specific geographic areas that may not maintain square proportions after projection.
