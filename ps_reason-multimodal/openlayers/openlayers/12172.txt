Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The green cross icon is being clipped/cut off when displacement is applied to the ol/style/Icon style.
**Cause**: This appears to be related to how OpenLayers handles the rendering viewport for Icon styles differently from RegularShape styles. When displacement is applied, the icon is moved from its original position, but the rendering viewport isn't being adjusted accordingly to accommodate the displaced position.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The icon style isn't behaving consistently with the RegularShape style example when using the same displacement settings.
**Cause**: Icon styles and RegularShape styles likely have different internal implementations for handling displacement. While RegularShape styles seem to properly account for the displacement in their rendering bounds calculations, Icon styles might not be expanding their rendering bounds to include the displaced position.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from how OpenLayers handles viewport calculations for displaced Icon styles. Unlike RegularShape styles, which properly handle displacement in their rendering bounds, Icon styles appear to have a limitation where their rendering viewport isn't properly adjusted when displacement is applied, resulting in clipping. This suggests there might be a need to update the OpenLayers library to ensure consistent behavior between different style types when using displacement.

Note: Without seeing the actual code implementation or the visual result, these are educated assumptions based on the problem description and common rendering issues in mapping libraries. The actual fix might require adjusting how OpenLayers calculates the rendering bounds for displaced Icon styles.
