Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGLTile Layer lacks a `setStyle` method for dynamic style updates
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't include functionality to modify visualization styles after the layer is created, requiring complete layer removal and recreation instead.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inefficient resource management when changing visualization
**Cause**: Due to the missing `setStyle` method, users have to remove and recreate the entire layer, which means:
- Previously downloaded raster data is discarded
- Network requests might need to be repeated
- Unnecessary memory allocation/deallocation cycles

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited user interaction capabilities
**Cause**: The inability to dynamically update styles prevents users from implementing interactive visualization changes, reducing the flexibility and usability of the WebGLTile Layer component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the WebGLTile Layer's implementation lacking a `setStyle` method, which leads to three main problems: inability to update styles dynamically, inefficient resource management, and limited user interaction capabilities. While implementing style changes would require additional work (shader rebuilding, buffer rebinding, etc.), the benefits would significantly improve the component's functionality and user experience. The current workaround of removing and recreating layers is inefficient and can lead to unnecessary resource consumption and network requests.
