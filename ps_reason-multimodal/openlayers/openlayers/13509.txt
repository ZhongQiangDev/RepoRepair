Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGLTile layer remains visible even when its parent Group layer's visibility is set to false
**Cause**: This appears to be a specific implementation issue with OpenLayers' WebGLTile layer type not properly respecting its parent Group layer's visibility property. The WebGL rendering pipeline might not be properly integrated with the layer group visibility inheritance system, unlike the traditional Tile layer implementation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between WebGLTile and regular Tile layers
**Cause**: The visibility handling mechanism differs between WebGL-based layers and traditional canvas-based layers in OpenLayers. While regular Tile layers follow the standard layer visibility inheritance chain, WebGLTile layers might be using a separate rendering path that bypasses or doesn't properly implement the group visibility checks.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from WebGLTile's implementation in OpenLayers not properly respecting the visibility state of its parent Group layer. This is likely due to the different rendering architecture used for WebGL-based layers compared to traditional canvas-based layers. While regular Tile layers correctly handle visibility inheritance, WebGLTile layers appear to have a broken or incomplete implementation of this feature. This suggests a potential bug in OpenLayers' WebGL layer handling system that needs to be addressed to ensure consistent behavior across all layer types.

The fix would likely require modifications to OpenLayers' WebGLTile implementation to ensure it properly respects its parent Group's visibility state, similar to how regular Tile layers handle this scenario.
