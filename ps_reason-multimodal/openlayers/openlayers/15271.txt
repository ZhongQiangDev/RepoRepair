Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to access feature ID through style expressions using the 'get' operator
**Cause**: The current style expression syntax only supports accessing properties from the feature's properties collection using ['get', 'attributeName'], but doesn't provide a way to access the feature's ID directly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential data redundancy in GeoJSON structure
**Cause**: To work around the limitation of not being able to access feature ID in style expressions, users might need to duplicate the ID value by storing it both as the feature ID and as a property, leading to unnecessary data duplication.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a limitation in the style expression syntax where there's no direct operator to access a feature's ID (feature.getId()). This forces users to either:
1. Not use the ID in style expressions at all, or
2. Duplicate the ID information by storing it both as the feature ID and as a property

The solution would likely involve implementing a new operator or extending the 'get' operator to allow access to the feature ID directly from style expressions, similar to how feature properties are currently accessed.
