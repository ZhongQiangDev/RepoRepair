I'll analyze the GitHub problem description following the requested format.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Black gaps/missing tiles appear near the antimeridian when rendering GeoTiff tiles in stereographic projection
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the way OpenLayers handles tile wrapping at the antimeridian (180°/-180° longitude) during reprojection. When transforming from the source projection (presumably WGS84) to the stereographic projection, the tile calculations may not properly account for the continuous nature of the map across the antimeridian.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The size of the black gaps varies with tile size and zoom level
**Cause**: This behavior suggests that the tile coordinate calculations during reprojection are not properly scaling or adjusting for different zoom levels and tile sizes. The reprojection algorithm might be using fixed boundaries or thresholds that don't adapt correctly to varying tile dimensions and zoom factors.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue specifically occurs with WebGLTileLayer when using GeoTIFF source
**Cause**: The WebGLTileLayer implementation might have specific limitations or bugs in handling reprojection of GeoTIFF data, particularly around the antimeridian. The WebGL rendering pipeline may not properly handle the texture coordinates or tile boundaries when dealing with the projection transformation at these edge cases.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a combination of projection handling problems in OpenLayers, specifically when dealing with WebGLTileLayer and GeoTIFF sources near the antimeridian. The main causes are:
1. Improper tile wrapping calculations at the antimeridian during reprojection
2. Scale-dependent issues in the reprojection algorithm
3. WebGLTileLayer-specific implementation limitations for GeoTIFF sources

The problem manifests as visible black gaps in the rendered output, with the severity varying based on zoom level and tile size. This suggests that a comprehensive fix would need to address both the projection transformation logic and the WebGL rendering implementation for tile boundaries.
