Let me analyze the GitHub problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The scale value type mismatch between original and cloned icons
**Cause**: When cloning an icon, the constructor is handling the scale property differently than the original setScale() method. While the original icon accepts a number value for scale, the cloning process converts it into an array containing height and width values.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent scale representation between setScale() and constructor
**Cause**: The setScale() method sets both height and width internally when called with a number value, but this internal representation conflicts with the documentation stating that height and width cannot be used with scale. This creates an architectural inconsistency in how scaling is handled.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Documentation and implementation mismatch
**Cause**: The documentation explicitly states that height and width cannot be used with scale, yet the internal implementation actually uses height and width values when setting scale. This indicates either outdated documentation or an implementation that doesn't follow the intended design.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from inconsistent handling of scale values across different parts of the codebase. The main problems are:
1. Type conversion during cloning (number â†’ array)
2. Conflicting approaches between setScale() and constructor implementation
3. Disconnect between documentation and actual implementation

The solution would likely require aligning the cloning process with the original scale setting mechanism, ensuring consistent type handling, and either updating the documentation or refactoring the implementation to match the documented behavior.
