Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Significant performance degradation when drawing interactions in OpenLayers 4.6.2 with renderMode: 'image' compared to 4.4.2 ImageVector
**Cause**: The deprecation of ol.source.ImageVector in OpenLayers 4.6.0 and the switch to renderMode: 'image' appears to have introduced rendering overhead, particularly noticeable when drawing triangles at high resolutions. The new rendering mode may be doing additional processing or using a less optimized rendering path.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor drawing performance specifically when working with triangle geometries at higher resolutions
**Cause**: The screenshot shows a high-resolution scenario where multiple triangles need to be rendered. The new rendering system in 4.6.2 may be handling vector-to-image conversion less efficiently than the previous ImageVector implementation, especially when dealing with complex geometries or high zoom levels.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Regression in rendering performance after upgrading from 4.4.2 to 4.6.2
**Cause**: The architectural change in OpenLayers 4.6.0+ that deprecated ol.source.ImageVector in favor of renderMode: 'image' represents a fundamental shift in how vector data is rendered to images. This suggests the new implementation may not be as optimized as the previous dedicated ImageVector source class.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the OpenLayers upgrade from 4.4.2 to 4.6.2, specifically related to the deprecation of ol.source.ImageVector. The new renderMode: 'image' implementation appears to have performance implications, particularly noticeable when rendering complex geometries like triangles at high resolutions. The problem manifests as slower drawing interactions, suggesting that the new rendering pipeline may need optimization or that developers may need to explore alternative rendering strategies for performance-critical applications.
