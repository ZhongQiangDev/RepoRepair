Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGLTileLayer fails to work with sources that use view projection with wrapX set to false
**Cause**: The WebGL renderer incorrectly assumes that all sources must have a tile grid, which is not always the case, especially for sources using view projection without wrapping

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incompatibility between ol/layer/WebGLTile and certain source configurations
**Cause**: There appears to be a fundamental difference in how WebGLTileLayer handles sources compared to the standard ol/layer/Tile, specifically in terms of tile grid requirements

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of functionality when switching from ol/layer/Tile to ol/layer/WebGLTile
**Cause**: The WebGLTileLayer implementation likely lacks proper handling for sources that don't conform to its expected tile grid structure, whereas the standard TileLayer is more flexible in this regard

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from WebGLTileLayer's strict requirement for tile grids, which causes compatibility problems with sources using view projection where wrapX is false. The standard TileLayer handles these cases correctly, but the WebGL implementation needs to be modified to support the same use cases. The problem appears to be architectural in nature, where the WebGL renderer makes assumptions about source configurations that don't hold true for all valid use cases. A referenced issue (#13212) may already contain fixes for this behavior, suggesting this is a known limitation in the current implementation.
