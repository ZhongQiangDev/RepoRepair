Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Unwanted gap/spacing between lines in multiline text labels in OpenLayers 4.6.4 and newer versions
**Cause**: The default line spacing (line-height) behavior changed between OpenLayers v2.13 and v4.6.4. The newer versions appear to implement automatic line spacing that cannot be easily controlled through the existing API.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of API control for text line spacing
**Cause**: The OpenLayers style.Text API doesn't provide a direct property or method to control the line spacing/line-height between multiple lines of text in labels. This limitation makes it impossible for users to customize the spacing according to their needs.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent text rendering behavior between different versions
**Cause**: The text rendering engine or default styling parameters were modified during the major version updates from v2.13 to v4.6.4, causing inconsistent behavior in how multiline text is displayed. This change wasn't properly documented or considered as a potential breaking change.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the handling of multiline text spacing in OpenLayers labels, which changed significantly between versions. The problem is compounded by the lack of API controls to manage line spacing, making it impossible for users to replicate the previous version's behavior or customize the spacing to their needs. The inconsistency between versions and the absence of proper documentation about these changes has created usability issues for developers who need precise control over label formatting.
