Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Sequential tile loading in OpenLayers 7.0 instead of concurrent loading
**Cause**: The upgrade from OpenLayers 6.1 to 7.0 appears to have changed how tile requests are handled within LayerGroups. The new version seems to have implemented a sequential loading mechanism, possibly as part of performance optimization or resource management changes, though not explicitly documented in release notes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Significantly slower imagery load times
**Cause**: The sequential loading behavior forces each TileLayer to wait for the previous layer's request to complete before starting its own request. With 20 TileLayers, this creates a cascading delay effect, whereas the previous concurrent loading allowed all requests to be processed simultaneously.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Undocumented behavioral change between versions
**Cause**: The change in tile loading behavior wasn't clearly documented in the release notes between versions 6.1 and 7.0, making it difficult for developers to anticipate and plan for this significant change in performance characteristics.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around a fundamental change in how OpenLayers 7.0 handles tile requests within LayerGroups compared to version 6.1. The switch from concurrent to sequential loading has created noticeable performance degradation, particularly for LayerGroups containing multiple TileLayers. This change appears to be undocumented, making it challenging for developers to understand whether this is an intentional change or an unintended side effect of other modifications. The impact is most visible in applications that rely on quick loading of multiple tile layers simultaneously.
