Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Black tiles not rendering when using WebGLTile layer with DataTile source
**Cause**: There appears to be a mismatch between the expected tile dimensions and the actual available data. The warning message indicates that the system is trying to upload 770 pixels but only 258 pixels are available, suggesting a data size inconsistency.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGL warning about insufficient data for texture upload
**Cause**: The tile grid configuration seems to have inconsistent specifications:
- The first tile size is set to [770, 768] which is asymmetric
- Subsequent tile sizes are all [240, 240]
- This inconsistency in tile sizes could be causing the WebGL texture mapping to fail when trying to render the tiles

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential regression in functionality
**Cause**: The user mentions this worked previously, suggesting a possible regression due to recent changes in OpenLayers, specifically referencing two pull requests:
- PR #11532
- PR #12024
These changes might have modified how tile dimensions are handled or how WebGL textures are processed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a combination of mismatched tile dimensions and data availability. The primary problem manifests as black tiles, caused by:
1. Data size mismatch between requested and available pixels
2. Inconsistent tile grid configuration
3. Possible regression from recent OpenLayers updates

The solution likely requires either adjusting the tile grid configuration to ensure consistent dimensions or investigating the impact of the referenced pull requests on tile handling.
