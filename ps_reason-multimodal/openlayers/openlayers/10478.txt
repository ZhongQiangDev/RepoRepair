Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: White areas appearing on the map when zooming in/out with a reprojected tile layer
**Cause**: Tile objects are being disposed prematurely while they're still needed for the reprojection stitching process. When these disposed tiles are excluded from the stitching process, it results in missing sections (white areas) in the final rendered map.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Including ABORT state tiles doesn't solve the problem
**Cause**: Simply modifying the loop in ol.reproj.Tile to include aborted tiles causes additional problems, suggesting there's a deeper issue with the tile lifecycle management. The ABORT state tiles might contain invalid or incomplete data that can't be properly used in the reprojection process.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Tile fetching mechanism isn't properly handling reprojection scenarios
**Cause**: The tile management system isn't correctly maintaining or refetching tiles when they're needed for reprojection. This could be due to improper coordination between the tile disposal mechanism and the reprojection process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper tile lifecycle management during reprojection operations. There are three main aspects to this problem: premature tile disposal, complications with ABORT state tiles, and inadequate tile fetching/maintenance mechanisms. The solution likely requires a comprehensive review of how tiles are managed during reprojection, ensuring tiles aren't disposed while still needed for stitching, and implementing proper tile refetching mechanisms when necessary. Simply including ABORT state tiles isn't sufficient and creates additional problems, indicating that a more fundamental solution involving tile lifecycle management is needed.
