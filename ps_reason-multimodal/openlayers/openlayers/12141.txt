Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: VectorSource.getExtent() returns [Infinity,Infinity,-Infinity,-Infinity] instead of the correct extent when called inside the featuresloadend callback.
**Cause**: The timing of the extent calculation occurs before the features are fully loaded and added to the source. The featuresloadend event is being triggered before the features are actually added to the VectorSource, resulting in an empty extent calculation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The callback sequence in the feature loader is not properly ordered.
**Cause**: In the src/ol/featureloader.js file, the success callback is being called before the features are completely added to the vector source. This creates a race condition where the featuresloadend event listener tries to access the extent before the data is ready.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Asynchronous loading of KML features is not properly handled.
**Cause**: The asynchronous nature of loading KML features through XHR (XMLHttpRequest) requires proper handling of the loading sequence. The current implementation doesn't wait for the features to be fully processed and added before firing the completion events.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from incorrect event timing and callback sequencing in the OpenLayers feature loader implementation. The featuresloadend event is triggered prematurely, before the features are actually added to the VectorSource. This causes the getExtent() method to return invalid infinity values since it's calculating the extent of an effectively empty source. The solution would involve restructuring the feature loading process to ensure features are fully added to the source before triggering the featuresloadend event, and properly handling the asynchronous nature of KML feature loading.
