Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The selected feature (ol.select.Interaction) is always displayed as the topmost layer, regardless of the zIndex settings
**Cause**: This appears to be default behavior in OpenLayers where selected features are automatically rendered on top of other layers to ensure visibility. The selection overlay seems to have a fixed rendering order that overrides normal layer zIndex settings.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Red dot hover effects are being rendered below the selected feature, making them partially or fully hidden
**Cause**: The selection interaction in OpenLayers creates a special overlay layer for selected features that is managed separately from the regular layer stack. This overlay layer appears to have precedence in the rendering pipeline, causing it to always appear above other vector features regardless of their configured zIndex values.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from OpenLayers' handling of selected features, where the selection interaction creates a special overlay layer that always renders on top. This behavior, while potentially helpful for ensuring selected features remain visible, can cause problems when trying to implement custom visualization effects (like hover indicators) that need to appear above selected features. The rigid rendering order appears to be built into OpenLayers' selection interaction implementation, making it difficult to control the stacking order between selected features and other visual elements.

The main technical limitation is the lack of control over the z-index of the selection overlay layer, which prevents developers from implementing certain desired visual hierarchies in their maps.
