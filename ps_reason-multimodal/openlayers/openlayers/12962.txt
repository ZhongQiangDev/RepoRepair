Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Layer opacity not working correctly for multiple layers with identical opacity values in OpenLayers 6.8.1 and later versions
**Cause**: The rendering mechanism in OpenLayers 6.8.1+ appears to handle layer stacking differently when layers have identical opacity values, causing the top-most layer to become opaque relative to other OpenLayers layers while still maintaining transparency with the basemap.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent rendering behavior between OpenLayers versions (6.7.0 vs 6.8.1+)
**Cause**: A change in the canvas rendering logic or layer compositing mechanism was likely introduced in version 6.8.1 that affects how multiple layers with identical opacity values are handled.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only manifests when layers have exactly the same opacity value
**Cause**: The layer compositing algorithm in 6.8.1+ might have a special case handling or optimization that fails to properly blend layers when their opacity values are identical, but works correctly when the values are different (even by small amounts like 0.49, 0.50, 0.51).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a regression in OpenLayers 6.8.1 and later versions related to layer opacity handling. The problem specifically occurs when multiple layers (particularly tiled ArcGIS REST layers) are assigned identical opacity values. The rendering engine fails to properly stack and blend these layers, causing the top-most layer to appear opaque relative to other OpenLayers layers while maintaining transparency with the basemap. This behavior can be worked around by using slightly different opacity values for each layer. The root cause likely stems from changes in the canvas rendering or layer compositing logic introduced in version 6.8.1.
