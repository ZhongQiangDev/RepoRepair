Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The custom className setting in ol.layer.HeatMap is not being applied to the heatmap layer
**Cause**: Based on the screenshot and description, it appears the className property is either not being properly passed to the underlying DOM element, or there may be an issue with how OpenLayers handles custom class names for heatmap layers specifically.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The default className is not visible on the page
**Cause**: This suggests there might be an issue with how the heatmap layer is being rendered in the DOM structure, possibly due to:
1. The layer initialization process not properly creating the necessary DOM elements
2. CSS specificity issues overriding the class assignments
3. A potential bug in the OpenLayers heatmap implementation for class handling

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be related to className handling in OpenLayers' heatmap layer implementation. Both custom and default classNames are not working as expected, suggesting there may be an underlying issue with how OpenLayers manages CSS classes for heatmap layers. This could be either a bug in the library itself or an implementation issue in how the heatmap layer creates and manages its DOM elements. Without seeing the actual code implementation, it's difficult to determine if this is a library bug or usage error.

Note: To provide a more detailed analysis, it would be helpful to see:
1. The actual code used to create the heatmap layer
2. The CSS being applied
3. The version of OpenLayers being used
