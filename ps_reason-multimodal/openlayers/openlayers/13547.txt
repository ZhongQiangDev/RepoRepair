Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Gutter/buffer option is only available for TileWMS source type, but not for other tile sources like XYZ and DataTile
**Cause**: The implementation of gutter/buffer functionality is currently limited to TileWMS in the codebase, despite other tile services (like Nextzen and Mapbox) supporting buffered tiles

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visible tile edge effects when interpolating between tiles
**Cause**: Lack of proper buffer/gutter support leads to discontinuities at tile boundaries when interpolation is performed, especially noticeable with terrain data

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect handling of gutters in WebGL tile layers
**Cause**: The current implementation removes the TileWMS gutter before creating the texture in WebGL rendering, which defeats the purpose of having a gutter to prevent edge effects

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent edge handling between datatiles and layer extents
**Cause**: Different handling mechanisms for tile boundaries versus layer extents - layer extents don't show edge effects while datatile boundaries do, indicating inconsistent implementation of boundary handling

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues revolve around limited and inconsistent implementation of tile buffer/gutter support across different tile source types. The current implementation only supports TileWMS, ignoring other tile services that provide buffered tiles. Additionally, the WebGL rendering pipeline doesn't properly utilize the gutter information, leading to visible artifacts at tile boundaries. These issues result in noticeable edge effects during interpolation, particularly evident in terrain visualization. The inconsistency between how layer extents and tile boundaries are handled further highlights the need for a more unified approach to managing tile edges.
