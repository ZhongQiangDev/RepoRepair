Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Cached tile textures remain visible when panning back or zooming out after changing the source using `setSource()`
**Cause**: The WebGL tile layer is not properly clearing its texture cache when the source is updated through `setSource()`. The old textures remain in memory and are incorrectly reused instead of being invalidated and replaced with new textures from the updated source.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect tile textures appear when changing view projection and navigating through previously viewed areas
**Cause**: The caching mechanism doesn't account for projection changes. When the view projection is modified, the existing cached textures are not invalidated, causing the system to display tiles rendered with the old projection settings instead of re-rendering them with the new projection.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Layer cache maintains textures for multiple projections unnecessarily
**Cause**: The caching system is designed to retain textures across different projections, even though layers are not shared between projections. This creates unnecessary memory usage and leads to confusion when tiles need to be rendered with different projection parameters.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an ineffective cache invalidation system in the WebGL tile layer implementation. The cache fails to properly clear when either the source is changed via `setSource()` or when the view projection is modified. Additionally, the caching mechanism unnecessarily retains textures for multiple projections despite layers not being shared across projections. This results in the display of outdated or incorrectly projected tiles when navigating through previously viewed areas. The solution would require implementing proper cache invalidation triggers for both source changes and projection modifications, as well as optimizing the caching strategy to only maintain textures for the current projection.
