Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Hit detection not working when icon scale is negative and rotation is 0
**Cause**: The negative scale likely inverts the hit detection area calculation, causing the hit detection system to look for interactions in the wrong location. The coordinate system for hit testing might not properly account for negative scale transformations.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Icon not rendering properly at the edge of the map
**Cause**: The rendering system probably calculates the icon's clipping boundaries based on the original (positive) scale values, not accounting for the negative scale transformation. This leads to incorrect boundary calculations when the icon reaches the map edges.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Icon disappears instead of getting partially cut off at map edges
**Cause**: The viewport culling system likely isn't handling negative scales correctly. When an object has a negative scale, the bounding box calculations might become inverted or invalid, causing the entire icon to be incorrectly culled (removed from rendering) instead of being properly clipped.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from the rendering and interaction systems not properly handling negative scale values. Three main problems are identified: broken hit detection, incorrect edge rendering, and improper viewport culling. All these issues appear to be related to how geometric calculations (for hit testing, clipping, and culling) handle negative scale transformations. The fix would likely involve updating these systems to properly account for negative scale values in their calculations.
