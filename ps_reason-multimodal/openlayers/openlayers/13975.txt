Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Icons with different scales are not aligned properly at their bottom positions despite having the same Y displacement value.

**Cause**: This appears to be related to how OpenLayers handles the anchor/displacement calculations in relation to scaling. When scaling is applied to an icon, it affects the entire icon including its anchor point and displacement values. The displacement is applied after scaling, which means the final position is influenced by both the scale factor and the displacement value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of clear documentation about the interaction between scale and displacement parameters in ol.style.Icon.

**Cause**: The OpenLayers API documentation (openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Icon-Icon.html) doesn't explicitly explain how scaling affects displacement calculations, making it difficult for developers to predict and work with icon positioning behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from how OpenLayers handles the relationship between icon scaling and displacement. The scaling factor affects the entire icon geometry, including how displacement is applied, which results in inconsistent bottom alignment when icons have different scales. This behavior is made more problematic by the lack of clear documentation about this interaction. To fix this, developers either need to:
1. Adjust displacement values to compensate for different scales
2. Consider using anchor points instead of displacement
3. The OpenLayers documentation should be updated to clearly explain this behavior
