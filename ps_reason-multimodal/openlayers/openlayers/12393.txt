Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Square images are being stretched unnecessarily when scaled to fit a square tile extent
**Cause**: The use of `Math.ceil()` in the scaling calculations is causing rounding up of dimensions, which leads to unnecessary stretching of the image even when the image should fit perfectly within the tile extent.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of image detail due to width reduction
**Cause**: The current scaling approach prioritizes reducing width over maintaining image quality, which results in unnecessary loss of image detail when the image could instead be scaled up to maintain its original proportions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent scaling behavior with floating-point calculations
**Cause**: JavaScript floating-point arithmetic combined with the current rounding strategy (`Math.ceil`) is creating discrepancies in the final dimensions, even when dealing with what should be perfect square-to-square scaling.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from three interconnected problems: unnecessary image stretching, detail loss, and floating-point calculation inconsistencies. The root cause appears to be the use of `Math.ceil()` in the scaling calculations, which was possibly implemented to prevent zero width in cases of negative scaling. A better approach would be to scale up dimensions as needed to maintain image quality and use proper rounding to the nearest pixel instead of always rounding up. This would preserve image proportions and prevent unnecessary stretching while handling floating-point calculations more appropriately.
