Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: `BigInt` type is not being syntax-highlighted like other built-in types (e.g., `Number`)
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules in the `ecmascript` grammar likely haven't been updated to include `BigInt` as a built-in type, which was a relatively newer addition to JavaScript (introduced in ES2020)

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: `BigInt64Array` is not recognized as a built-in type
**Cause**: Similar to `BigInt`, the typed array `BigInt64Array` is missing from the grammar definitions for JavaScript/ECMAScript syntax highlighting

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: `BigUint64Array` is not recognized as a built-in type
**Cause**: The `BigUint64Array` typed array, which was introduced alongside other BigInt features, is not included in the syntax highlighting rules

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete syntax highlighting rules in the ECMAScript/JavaScript grammar that don't account for newer BigInt-related features. All three missing highlights (`BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array`) are related to the BigInt functionality introduced in ES2020. The grammar files need to be updated to include these newer JavaScript built-in types to provide consistent syntax highlighting with other built-in types like `Number`. This appears to be a maintenance issue where the syntax highlighting rules haven't kept pace with JavaScript language evolution.
