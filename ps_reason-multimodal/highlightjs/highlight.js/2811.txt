Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment after the decorator (`@pytest.mark.asyncio  # note use of pytest-asyncio marker`) is not being formatted as a comment (not greyed out) in syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is incorrectly applying the `hljs-meta` class to the entire line including the comment portion, instead of properly separating the decorator part (`@pytest.mark.asyncio`) and the comment part (`# note use of pytest-asyncio marker`)

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent comment formatting between decorator lines and regular code lines
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is treating decorator lines differently from regular code lines. While comments on regular code lines (like `async def test_async_for():  # but this comment works ðŸ¤”`) are properly formatted with the `hljs-comment` class, the highlighter fails to apply the same rules to comments on decorator lines.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is a syntax highlighting bug where comments on decorator lines in Python code are not being properly identified and formatted. This appears to be due to the highlighter's logic treating the entire decorator line as metadata (`hljs-meta`), preventing it from correctly identifying and formatting inline comments. The issue is particularly noticeable because comments on regular code lines are formatted correctly, creating an inconsistent appearance in the code display. This needs to be fixed by modifying the highlighter to properly parse and format comments on decorator lines while maintaining the correct highlighting for the decorator syntax itself.
