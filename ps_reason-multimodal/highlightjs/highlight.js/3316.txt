Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting of primitive types (int, char, etc.) compared to previous versions
**Cause**: A change in hljs 11.0.0 that split primitive types and keywords into separate highlighting categories, moving primitive types from `RESERVED_TYPES` to `RESERVED_KEYWORDS`

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Deviation from common IDE and text editor syntax highlighting conventions
**Cause**: The new highlighting scheme doesn't match the industry standard practice shown in popular IDEs (Visual Studio Code, CLion, XCode, Notepad++), where primitive types are highlighted the same way as keywords

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Technically incorrect categorization according to C++ standard
**Cause**: The separation of primitive types from keywords contradicts the C++ standard specification, which explicitly defines primitive types as keywords

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent handling in Arduino code highlighting
**Cause**: The change affected Arduino syntax highlighting, requiring additional modifications since Arduino is a C++ superset, leading to potential confusion in Arduino-specific data types

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from a highlighting categorization change in hljs 11.0.0 that separated primitive types from keywords. This change created three major problems: 1) inconsistency with previous versions, 2) deviation from common IDE practices, and 3) contradiction with the C++ standard. The change also had ripple effects on Arduino syntax highlighting. The root cause appears to be an architectural decision that didn't fully consider the technical specifications of C++ and common industry practices in syntax highlighting.
