Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `switch` keyword is not highlighted in the same style as other control flow keywords (like `if`, `while`, `for`) in C++ code starting from hljs version 10.7.0
**Cause**: This appears to be a regression introduced in highlight.js version 10.7.0 where the syntax highlighting rules for the `switch` keyword were likely modified or incorrectly categorized in the C++ language definition, causing it to lose its control flow keyword styling.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent syntax highlighting between different versions of highlight.js (10.6.0 vs 10.7.0+)
**Cause**: A change in the language definition or core highlighting logic between versions 10.6.0 and 10.7.0 has affected how control flow keywords are classified and styled. The regression suggests that either:
1. The `switch` keyword was accidentally removed from the control flow keywords list
2. The keyword classification rules were modified in a way that affected `switch` specifically

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual hierarchy disruption in code readability
**Cause**: The inconsistent highlighting of the `switch` keyword compared to other control flow statements makes the code structure less immediately apparent to readers, as important control flow constructs should be visually consistent for better code comprehension.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is a regression in highlight.js that causes the `switch` keyword to be highlighted differently from other control flow keywords in C++. This was introduced between versions 10.6.0 and 10.7.0, and persists in version 11.2.0. The problem likely stems from changes in the language definition or syntax highlighting rules that specifically affected the `switch` keyword's classification. This creates both technical inconsistency in the highlighting behavior and practical issues for code readability. The fix would likely involve restoring the correct keyword classification for `switch` in the C++ language definition.
