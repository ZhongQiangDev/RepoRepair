Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In the type parameter "OutT", the "Out" part is highlighted differently from the "T" part in the syntax highlighting.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be treating camel-case type parameters inconsistently, likely because it's interpreting "Out" as a separate token from "T" instead of treating the entire "OutT" as a single type parameter identifier.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting in JSFiddle differs from GitHub's markdown code fence highlighting for TypeScript.
**Cause**: Different syntax highlighting engines are being used:
- GitHub uses its own syntax highlighting system (likely Linguist)
- JSFiddle might be using a different highlighter library that hasn't been optimized for TypeScript's type parameter naming conventions

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting of similar type parameters throughout the code (FPs, OutT, InT).
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter's tokenization rules might not be properly configured to handle TypeScript's type parameter naming patterns, especially when they contain multiple uppercase letters or camel-case formatting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around inconsistent syntax highlighting of camel-case type parameters in TypeScript code. The root cause appears to be the syntax highlighter's tokenization rules not being properly configured to handle TypeScript's type parameter naming conventions, particularly for compound names using camel case. This is especially evident when comparing different platforms (GitHub vs. JSFiddle) which use different syntax highlighting engines. GitHub's implementation appears to handle these cases more appropriately than other platforms.
