Let me analyze the GitHub issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: CMake multi-line comments using `#[[...]]` syntax are not being highlighted correctly as comments
**Cause**: The highlight.js CMake language definition appears to only recognize single-line comments starting with `#` but doesn't have proper support for the bracket comment syntax (`#[[...]]`) that CMake uses for multi-line comments

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment text is being displayed in the default text color instead of the comment color
**Cause**: Since the multi-line comment syntax isn't properly recognized, the text between `#[[` and `]]` is being treated as regular code rather than comment content, resulting in incorrect syntax highlighting

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment opening/closing delimiters (`#[[` and `]]`) are not being treated as a single token
**Cause**: The language parser in highlight.js likely splits these into separate tokens (`#` and `[[`), causing it to miss the multi-line comment pattern matching

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete implementation of CMake's bracket comment syntax in highlight.js's CMake language definition. The parser appears to only handle simple single-line `#` comments, failing to properly recognize and highlight the `#[[...]]` bracket comment syntax as a multi-line comment construct. This results in incorrect syntax highlighting where multi-line comments appear as regular code instead of being properly styled as comment text. The fix would require updating the CMake language definition in highlight.js to properly handle bracket comments.
