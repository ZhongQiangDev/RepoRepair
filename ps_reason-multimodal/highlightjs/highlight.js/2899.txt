Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Syntax highlighting stops working after an empty block comment (`/**/`)
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be incorrectly handling empty block comments, treating them as unclosed comments, which causes it to interpret all subsequent code as part of the comment rather than actual code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code after the first empty block comment is displayed in plain text without any color highlighting
**Cause**: The parser likely loses its state tracking after encountering the empty block comment, failing to properly recognize that the comment has ended and that subsequent tokens should be parsed as Dart code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The second empty block comment at the end of the line is also not properly highlighted
**Cause**: Since the syntax highlighter is already in an incorrect state from the first empty block comment, it cannot properly process the second block comment, treating the entire rest of the line as plain text.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of empty block comments (`/**/`) in the Dart syntax highlighter. When encountering these empty comments, the highlighter's state management breaks down, causing it to:
1. Stop syntax highlighting for all subsequent code
2. Fail to properly recognize code tokens after the empty comment
3. Treat remaining code as plain text instead of Dart syntax

This appears to be a parser implementation issue that needs to be fixed to properly handle empty block comments while maintaining correct syntax highlighting state throughout the rest of the code.
