Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The CSS syntax highlighter incorrectly interprets parentheses within URL strings, breaking the string highlighting at the parenthesis.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be treating the parenthesis "(" in filenames (like "background (01).jpg") as a syntax boundary, rather than recognizing it as part of the string content within the URL quotes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting is inconsistent between single and double quoted strings containing parentheses.
**Cause**: The highlighter's string parsing logic likely prioritizes parentheses matching over string boundary detection, causing it to prematurely end string highlighting when it encounters a parenthesis.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting fails to properly maintain the string context within the url() function.
**Cause**: The highlighter's tokenization rules for CSS functions (like url()) don't properly handle nested delimiters (parentheses) when they appear within quoted strings.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the CSS syntax highlighter's incorrect precedence rules when handling nested delimiters. The highlighter is treating parentheses as higher priority than string quotes, causing it to break string highlighting when it encounters parentheses in filenames. This affects both the visual presentation and the semantic understanding of the code. The highlighter needs to be modified to properly respect string boundaries before considering parentheses matching, especially within the context of CSS URL functions.
