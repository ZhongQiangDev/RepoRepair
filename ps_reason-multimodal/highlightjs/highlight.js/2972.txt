Let me analyze the GitHub issue about Python Type Hints support in highlight.js.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited syntax highlighting for Python type hints (PEP 484), particularly for annotations like `Dict[int, Any]` and `List[float]`
**Cause**: The highlight.js implementation only includes basic type hint support based on the referenced commit (07e30ad6), lacking comprehensive rules for complex type annotations and generic types

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing visual distinction between different components of type hints (e.g., base types, generic parameters)
**Cause**: The current highlighting rules don't have specific patterns to differentiate between:
- Base types (Dict, List)
- Type parameters (int, float, Any)
- Special syntax characters ([ , ])

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency with other popular syntax highlighters like Magic Python
**Cause**: highlight.js uses a different, more simplified approach to syntax highlighting compared to more specialized tools like Magic Python, which was specifically designed for Python and includes comprehensive support for modern Python features

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from highlight.js's limited implementation of Python type hint highlighting. The problems manifest in three main areas: 1) incomplete support for PEP 484 type hints, 2) lack of granular highlighting rules for type hint components, and 3) deviation from established highlighting patterns seen in specialized tools. These issues primarily originate from the initial implementation being too basic and not being updated to match the evolution of Python's type system and modern highlighting expectations.
