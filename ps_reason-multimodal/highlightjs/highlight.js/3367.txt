Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighter fails to properly separate and highlight the number '1' from the keyword 'if' when they appear together without space (1if)
**Cause**: The tokenizer/lexer in the syntax highlighter likely doesn't have proper rules to handle number-keyword combinations without spaces. It's treating "1if" as a single token instead of separating it into a numeric token "1" and a keyword token "if".

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The 'print' function is not highlighted as a built-in function
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter's rules for Python may not include 'print' in its list of built-in functions that should receive special highlighting, or the rules for built-in function highlighting are not properly implemented.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The overall syntax highlighting differs from GitHub's standard Python syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The highlighter being used (likely highlight.js) has different tokenization rules and color schemes compared to GitHub's native syntax highlighter, leading to inconsistent highlighting behavior between platforms.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from inadequate tokenization rules in the syntax highlighter, particularly for handling adjacent numbers and keywords without spaces. This is a valid Python syntax that should be properly parsed and highlighted. Secondary issues include inconsistent treatment of built-in functions and deviation from GitHub's standard highlighting patterns. The root cause appears to be limitations in the lexical analysis phase of the syntax highlighter, which needs to be updated to handle these edge cases in Python syntax correctly.
