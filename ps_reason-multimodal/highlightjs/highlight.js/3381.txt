Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Python identifier `_undef` is incorrectly split and partially highlighted as if `def` was a keyword
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter (highlight.js v11.0.0) is incorrectly parsing the identifier by:
1. Not treating `_undef` as a single token
2. Pattern matching the `def` portion separately and applying keyword highlighting rules to it
3. This appears to be a regression as it worked correctly in v10.7.3

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The HTML output shows incorrect tokenization by splitting the identifier
**Cause**: The highlighter is generating incorrect HTML markup by:
1. Breaking `_undef` into `_un` and `def` parts
2. Wrapping the `def` portion in a `<span class="hljs-keyword">` element
3. This indicates the lexical analysis phase is not properly handling identifier boundaries

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is context-sensitive and only occurs in certain situations
**Cause**: The bug appears to be triggered by specific token sequences:
1. It happens when the identifier is followed by a newline and another identifier
2. It doesn't occur when followed by other token types (like literals `[]`)
3. This suggests the lookahead/context analysis in the highlighter has flaws in certain patterns

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from highlight.js v11.0.0 having incorrect lexical analysis rules that fail to properly handle Python identifiers containing keyword-like substrings. The highlighter incorrectly splits identifiers and applies keyword highlighting rules to portions that match keywords. The bug is context-sensitive and appears to be a regression from previous versions. The fix would likely involve updating the lexer rules to properly handle complete identifier tokens and prevent mid-token highlighting changes.
