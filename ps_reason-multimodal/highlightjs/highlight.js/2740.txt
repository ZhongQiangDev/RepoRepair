Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Syntax highlighting breaks after string escape sequences in dynamic SQL, particularly after the escaped quotes in the `@DropViewStatement` declaration.
**Cause**: The highlight.js SQL/TSQL parser appears to have difficulty handling nested quote escape sequences, especially in the pattern `N''...''` where single quotes are doubled up for T-SQL string escaping.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between GitHub's syntax highlighting and other platforms (like Stack Overflow) for the same SQL code.
**Cause**: Different syntax highlighting engines or configurations are being used across platforms. GitHub seems to handle the escape sequences correctly, while highlight.js (used by Stack Overflow and shown in the CodePen example) fails to properly parse the nested quotes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting issue affects both 'sql' and 'tsql' language modes in highlight.js.
**Cause**: The core parser logic for handling escaped quotes is likely shared between both SQL and T-SQL language definitions in highlight.js, meaning the issue is fundamental to how the library processes SQL string literals rather than being specific to one SQL dialect.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around highlight.js's inability to properly handle nested quote escape sequences in SQL code, particularly in dynamic SQL scenarios. This manifests as broken syntax highlighting after encountering specific escape patterns. The problem appears to be a parser limitation in highlight.js rather than an issue with the SQL code itself, as evidenced by GitHub's correct handling of the same code. The issue affects both SQL and T-SQL language modes, suggesting a fundamental limitation in the library's SQL string literal parsing logic.
