Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Single slash character (`?/`) is not properly highlighted and breaks subsequent code highlighting
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter incorrectly interprets the single slash character as the beginning of a regular expression pattern, rather than a character literal

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Escaped backslash character (`?\\`) is not properly highlighted
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter doesn't properly handle the double backslash escape sequence in character literal context

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-ASCII characters (like `?„ÅÇ`) are not properly highlighted
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter's token recognition system appears to be limited to ASCII characters and doesn't properly handle Unicode/multi-byte characters in character literal notation

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Unicode characters using curly-bracket notation (`?\u{1AF9}`) are not highlighted correctly
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter doesn't recognize the Ruby-specific Unicode escape sequence syntax with curly braces

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Control and Meta characters (like `?\C-a`) are not properly highlighted
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter lacks support for Ruby's special character notation for control and meta characters, which use specific prefixes (`\C-`, `\M-`)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the syntax highlighter's incomplete implementation of Ruby's character literal notation. The highlighter appears to only support basic ASCII character literals while failing to properly handle more complex cases including:
1. Forward slash characters (due to regex confusion)
2. Escaped backslashes
3. Non-ASCII/Unicode characters
4. Unicode escape sequences with curly braces
5. Control and Meta character notation

The root cause appears to be that the syntax highlighter's tokenizer needs to be updated to fully support all valid Ruby character literal syntaxes according to the Ruby language specification.
