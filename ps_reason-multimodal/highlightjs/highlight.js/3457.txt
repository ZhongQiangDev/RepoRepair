Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Text formatting (bold + italics) extends beyond its intended scope
**Cause**: The Markdown parser likely has an issue with properly closing nested formatting tags when both bold and italics are applied simultaneously. When encountering combined formatting markers (***text***), the parser fails to properly recognize the closing markers, causing the formatting to "leak" into the rest of the document.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Closing bold/italics markers are ignored
**Cause**: The Markdown parser's state management system isn't properly handling the combination of multiple formatting markers. When it encounters subsequent closing markers (*** or **/* or */**), it fails to reset its internal state, causing it to ignore these closing sequences.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent rendering of markdown formatting
**Cause**: The parser's precedence rules for handling nested or combined formatting markers (bold within italics or vice versa) are likely not properly implemented, leading to ambiguous interpretation of the formatting sequences.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of combined bold and italics markdown formatting. The parser exhibits three main problems: formatting leakage beyond intended scope, ignored closing markers, and inconsistent rendering. These issues appear to be related to the parser's state management and its ability to properly handle nested formatting markers. The fix shown in the "After" image suggests that the implementation was updated to properly contain the formatting within its intended scope and correctly process closing markers.
