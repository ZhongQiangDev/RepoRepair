Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Backtick-quoted identifiers (``) in SQL queries are not being highlighted as strings
**Cause**: The regex pattern in Prism's SQL language definition doesn't properly handle backticks as string delimiters. The current pattern only recognizes single quotes (') and double quotes (") as string delimiters by default.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Syntax highlighting treats backtick-quoted table/column names as regular text
**Cause**: The SQL syntax highlighter configuration in Prism.languages.sql doesn't have specific rules for handling MySQL-style backtick identifiers, which are commonly used to escape table and column names in MySQL.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting between different types of quotes
**Cause**: The pattern matching in the regex /(^|[^@\\])("|'|`)(?:\\[\s\S]|(?!\2)[^\\]|\2\2)*\2/ needs to be updated to properly include backticks as valid string delimiters, similar to how it handles single and double quotes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete syntax highlighting rules in Prism's SQL language definition, specifically regarding MySQL's backtick notation. The main problems are:
1. Missing proper backtick handling in the string pattern matching
2. Lack of specific rules for MySQL identifier quoting
3. Inconsistent treatment of different quote types

The solution, as mentioned in the description, involves updating the regex pattern in Prism's SQL language definition to properly recognize and highlight backtick-quoted identifiers as strings, similar to how it handles other types of quoted strings.
