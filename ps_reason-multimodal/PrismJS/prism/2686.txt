Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Shell session syntax highlighting is not working in newer downloads of Prism versions 1.22 and 1.23
**Cause**: Based on the screenshots and description, there appears to be a regression in the tokenizer functionality between different downloads of the same version (1.22). This suggests changes in the download generation code rather than the core version code itself.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: DOM tree shows incorrect tokenization structure
**Cause**: The tokenizer is not properly parsing and separating the shell session components (prompts, commands, and output) as evidenced by the DOM tree screenshot showing lack of proper token classification.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between different downloads of the same version (1.22)
**Cause**: This indicates an issue with how the download packages are being generated or bundled, rather than a version-specific bug. The fact that it worked in an earlier 1.22 download but broke in later ones of the same version suggests a problem in the build/distribution process.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists across both minified and development downloads
**Cause**: Since both versions exhibit the same problem, this suggests the issue lies in the core tokenizer logic or its inclusion in the build process, rather than in the minification process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is a broken shell session tokenizer in newer downloads of Prism 1.22 and 1.23. The problem appears to be related to how the tokenizer is being included or processed during the package generation, affecting both minified and development versions. The key evidence is the inconsistency between different downloads of the same version and the visible lack of proper tokenization in the DOM structure. This points to a build/distribution issue rather than a core version bug, as the functionality worked correctly in earlier downloads of the same version.
