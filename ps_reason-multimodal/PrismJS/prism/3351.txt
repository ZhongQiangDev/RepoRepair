Let me analyze the problem and break it down:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Java import class "UUID" is not being syntax highlighted as a class name in Prism.js, while it appears correctly highlighted on GitHub.
**Cause**: This appears to be a limitation or bug in Prism.js's Java language definition where it's not properly recognizing "UUID" as a standard Java class name in import statements. The tokenizer likely needs to be updated to include UUID in its list of known Java class names or improve its import statement parsing rules.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting inconsistency between Prism.js and GitHub's syntax highlighter creates a confusing developer experience.
**Cause**: Different syntax highlighters (Prism.js vs GitHub's linguist) have different language definition rules and token classifications. GitHub's implementation correctly identifies UUID as a class name token, while Prism.js's implementation treats it as plain text.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prism.js's Java language definition not properly handling the UUID class name in import statements. This creates both a technical issue (incorrect syntax highlighting) and a user experience issue (inconsistency with other popular highlighting tools like GitHub's). The fix would likely require updating Prism.js's Java language definition to properly tokenize UUID and potentially other standard Java class names in import statements. This could be done either by explicitly adding UUID to a list of known class names or by improving the import statement parsing logic to better handle standard Java library classes.
