Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Apex code is being displayed/highlighted as Java code in the syntax highlighting system
**Cause**: The current implementation simply aliases Apex to Java's language definition, which doesn't account for Apex-specific syntax and features that differ from Java

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Language display shows "java" instead of "apex" when using the display language addon
**Cause**: Direct aliasing of languages doesn't properly handle the language identifier/display name, causing the original language (Java) to be shown instead of the desired language (Apex)

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential missing Apex-specific syntax highlighting
**Cause**: By using Java's language definition directly, Apex-specific keywords, built-in functions, and SOQL queries would not be properly highlighted since these features don't exist in Java

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inefficient implementation approach being considered
**Cause**: The current solution of creating a complete new language definition might be unnecessarily complex when what's really needed is a way to extend the Java definition with Apex-specific additions

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the limitations of simple language aliasing in the syntax highlighting system. While Apex shares similarities with Java, treating it as a pure alias leads to several problems: incorrect language display, missing Apex-specific syntax highlighting, and potential maintenance overhead. A better approach might be to create a mechanism to extend existing language definitions while maintaining proper language identification and adding support for language-specific features.
