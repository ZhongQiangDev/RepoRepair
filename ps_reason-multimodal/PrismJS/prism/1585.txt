Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The CSS `!important` flag is not being properly tokenized when it appears together with a CSS value and statement.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting/parsing logic appears to be treating the entire "red !important" as a single token instead of recognizing "!important" as a separate special CSS keyword token.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The color value "red" and "!important" are highlighted in the same color/style
**Cause**: The tokenizer is likely using a simplified pattern matching that doesn't properly separate property values from CSS keywords/flags, treating them as part of the same token group.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of distinct visual differentiation between the property value and the important flag
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules don't have a specific pattern or condition to identify and separately highlight the `!important` declaration when it immediately follows a property value without spaces.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around improper tokenization of CSS syntax where the `!important` flag is not being recognized as a separate token when it appears immediately after a property value. This results in incorrect syntax highlighting where both the value and the important flag are treated as a single token instead of being properly separated. The tokenizer needs to be updated to properly identify and handle the `!important` flag as a distinct token regardless of its proximity to property values.
