Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing official G-code syntax highlighting support in Prism.js
**Cause**: Prism.js doesn't include G-code as one of its officially supported languages, despite G-code being a widely used numerical control programming language.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The suggested implementation uses 'reprap_gcode' as the language identifier instead of just 'gcode'
**Cause**: The code is borrowed from a RepRap-specific implementation, which may not be generic enough for all G-code variants and doesn't match the requested language identifier.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited syntax highlighting patterns
**Cause**: The current implementation only covers basic patterns:
- Comments (;.*)
- Keywords (G and M codes)
- Properties (X, Y, Z, etc.)
This might miss other important G-code elements or special cases.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potentially outdated regex flags
**Cause**: The use of the 'g' flag in regex patterns (/pattern/g) is generally discouraged in Prism.js language definitions as Prism handles the global matching internally.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the lack of official G-code syntax highlighting in Prism.js. The proposed solution, while functional, has several limitations: it uses a RepRap-specific identifier, has limited syntax coverage, and contains potentially problematic regex patterns. To properly implement this feature, it would need to be standardized with the correct language identifier ('gcode'), comprehensive syntax coverage, and proper regex implementations following Prism.js best practices.
