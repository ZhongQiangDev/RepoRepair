Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting breaks when a string contains an '@' symbol in VB.NET code
**Cause**: The string pattern regex in prism-basic.js doesn't include the '@' character in its allowed character set for string contents, causing incorrect tokenization when @ appears in strings

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The first SQL command string is not properly highlighted while the second identical command (without @) works fine
**Cause**: The current regex pattern `/"(?:""|[!#$%&'()*,\/:;<=>?^_ +\-.A-Z\d])*"/i` in prism-basic.js specifically excludes '@' from the allowed characters within string literals

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting inconsistency affects SQL parameter declarations specifically
**Cause**: VB.NET's common use case of SQL parameters with @ prefix (like @Code) isn't accounted for in the basic language definition, despite being a standard practice in ADO.NET database programming

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an incomplete regular expression pattern in prism-basic.js that doesn't account for the '@' character in string literals. This particularly affects VB.NET code when using SQL commands with parameterized queries, which commonly use @ as a parameter prefix. The solution would involve adding '@' to the character class in the string pattern regex, though careful consideration needs to be given to potential impacts on other languages that extend the basic language definition.
