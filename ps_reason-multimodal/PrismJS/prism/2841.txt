Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: String interpolation (`#{bar}`) within regex literals using forward slash notation (`/.../`) is not being syntax highlighted correctly in Ruby code.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules in Prism.js for Ruby regex literals using forward slash notation (`/.../`) likely don't properly handle or recognize string interpolation patterns within the regex.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting behavior between different regex literal notations
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules are working correctly for the `%r{...}` notation but not for the standard `/.../` notation, suggesting incomplete or inconsistent implementation of Ruby regex literal parsing rules in Prism.js.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from Prism.js's syntax highlighting implementation for Ruby, where string interpolation within regex literals is not being properly recognized when using the forward slash notation (`/.../`). This appears to be a selective implementation issue since the same interpolation works correctly with the alternate `%r{...}` notation. The root cause likely lies in how Prism.js's tokenizer handles nested language constructs within Ruby regex literals, specifically failing to properly parse interpolation sequences in the traditional slash-delimited regex syntax.
