From the GitHub problem description, this appears to be a feature request rather than a bug report - the user is requesting language support for Mermaid diagram syntax. Let me analyze this in the requested format:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of Mermaid language syntax support in the system/editor
**Cause**: The system currently does not have built-in recognition and syntax highlighting for Mermaid diagram code blocks

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No diagram preview/rendering capability
**Cause**: Without Mermaid language integration, the system cannot automatically render the text-based diagram descriptions into visual diagrams

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No code completion or validation for Mermaid syntax
**Cause**: Missing language server protocol (LSP) implementation for Mermaid that would provide features like autocomplete, syntax validation, and error checking

### Conclusion
**Summary**: This is a feature request to add Mermaid diagram language support. The main issues are:
1. Missing syntax highlighting and recognition for Mermaid code blocks
2. Lack of built-in diagram rendering capabilities
3. Absence of code intelligence features like completion and validation

The solution would require implementing proper language support including syntax highlighting, a rendering engine, and potentially LSP features to provide a complete Mermaid diagramming experience in the editor/system.

Note: Since this is actually a feature request rather than a bug report, these "wrong behaviors" are really missing features rather than malfunctions in existing functionality.
