Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The word "inference" in the import statement is incorrectly highlighted as a keyword
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is treating any word that starts with the keyword "infer" as a keyword itself, instead of properly recognizing it as a separate identifier/variable name

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The word "typeDefs" in the import statement is incorrectly highlighted as a keyword
**Cause**: Similar to Answer 1, the syntax highlighter is treating any word that starts with the keyword "type" as a keyword, failing to distinguish between the actual keyword and variable names that happen to start with "type"

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between different keywords - "constants" is correctly highlighted while "inference" and "typeDefs" are not
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules appear to be implemented differently for different keywords. The rule for "const" seems to be working correctly with proper word boundary checking, while the rules for "infer" and "type" are missing proper word boundary checks.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper word boundary handling in the syntax highlighter for TypeScript keywords, specifically "infer" and "type". The highlighter is incorrectly treating any word that begins with these keywords as keywords themselves, instead of only highlighting exact keyword matches. This results in false positive highlighting for variable names like "inference" and "typeDefs". The fact that "constants" is handled correctly suggests that the implementation of keyword highlighting rules is inconsistent across different keywords in the syntax highlighter.
