Let me analyze the GitHub issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Single quotes in HTML attribute values are being highlighted as punctuation
**Cause**: The Prism syntax highlighter's language-markup (HTML) grammar is likely treating all quote characters as punctuation tokens, regardless of their context within attribute values. This causes quotes that are part of the actual data string to be highlighted incorrectly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: JSON data structure within HTML attributes is not being recognized properly
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to lack proper nested language support or context awareness for parsing JSON-like structures within HTML attribute values. It's treating the content as plain text with punctuation rather than recognizing it as a structured data format.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent visual representation of data content vs HTML syntax
**Cause**: The current highlighting scheme doesn't differentiate between quotes used for HTML attribute delimitation and quotes used within the attribute value's content. This creates visual confusion about what is structural HTML and what is data content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prism's HTML tokenizer treating all quotes as punctuation markers without considering their context. This creates three related problems: incorrect highlighting of content quotes, failure to recognize nested data structures, and poor visual distinction between HTML syntax and data content. The root cause appears to be limitations in the language-markup grammar implementation regarding context-aware token parsing. While this behavior might be technically consistent with how the tokenizer was implemented, it reduces code readability and could be improved by making the highlighter more context-aware.
