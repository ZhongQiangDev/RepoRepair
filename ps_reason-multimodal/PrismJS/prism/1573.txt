Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: F# type annotations (like `: string` and `: int`) are not syntax highlighted in the editor
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules in the editor's TextMate grammar likely don't include proper patterns to recognize and highlight F# type annotations after the colon symbol

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The coloring scheme differs from Visual Studio's standard F# highlighting
**Cause**: The editor's color theme settings for F# language tokens may not be properly mapped to match Visual Studio's default F# color scheme, particularly for type annotations

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual distinction between variables and their types is missing
**Cause**: The TextMate grammar rules may not be properly categorizing type annotations as distinct tokens from variable names, preventing them from being styled differently

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be incomplete or incorrect syntax highlighting rules for F# in the editor's TextMate grammar. This manifests in three main ways: lack of highlighting for type annotations, deviation from Visual Studio's standard color scheme, and poor visual distinction between variables and types. The primary fix would likely involve updating the TextMate grammar rules to properly recognize and tokenize F# type annotations, followed by ensuring the color theme correctly maps these tokens to appropriate colors that match Visual Studio's F# highlighting conventions.
