Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: PrismJS syntax highlighter fails to properly highlight Elixir attribute names that end with a question mark (?)
**Cause**: The current regex pattern in PrismJS's Elixir component (`/\w+:(?!:)/`) doesn't include the optional question mark character at the end of attribute names. This means attributes like `attribute?:` aren't being properly tokenized as `attr-name`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between GitHub's syntax highlighting and PrismJS's highlighting
**Cause**: While GitHub's syntax highlighter correctly recognizes and highlights Elixir attributes ending with `?`, PrismJS's implementation is missing this feature due to the incomplete regex pattern. This creates an inconsistent experience across different platforms.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Invalid token classification in pattern matching contexts
**Cause**: In the example code `%{attribute: a, attribute?: b}`, the `attribute?:` pattern isn't being properly tokenized, affecting the readability and understanding of the code structure, particularly in pattern matching scenarios.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an incomplete regex pattern in PrismJS's Elixir syntax highlighting component. The current pattern doesn't account for Elixir's valid syntax where attribute names can end with a question mark. This causes inconsistent highlighting compared to other platforms like GitHub and reduces code readability. The proposed fix (`/\w+?\?:(?!:)/`) would add support for the optional question mark character, bringing PrismJS's highlighting in line with Elixir's language specifications and other syntax highlighters.
