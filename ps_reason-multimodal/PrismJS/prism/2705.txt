Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Template literal syntax highlighting breaks after specific code patterns appear in a particular order
**Cause**: The PrismJS parser's state management seems to get confused when it encounters three specific patterns in sequence:
1. A regex with a single quote followed by a template literal containing a single quote
2. A comment containing a template literal
3. Regular template literals after these patterns

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The first template tag token is being ignored in affected lines
**Cause**: The parser appears to lose track of template literal boundaries after processing the specific combination of regex and comment patterns, causing it to miss the opening backtick token

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Template tag parsing becomes inverted for the rest of the file
**Cause**: Once the parser's state becomes corrupted after the triggering patterns, it fails to properly reset its internal state for subsequent template literals, causing all following template literal highlighting to be incorrect

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a parser state management problem in PrismJS when handling template literals. The bug is triggered by a specific sequence of patterns:
1. A regex containing a single quote followed by a template literal with a single quote
2. A comment containing a template literal
3. Regular template literals

This sequence causes the parser to:
- Miss opening template literal tokens
- Incorrectly process all subsequent template literals
- Maintain this broken state throughout the rest of the file

The fix would likely involve reviewing and correcting how the parser maintains state when processing these specific patterns, especially focusing on proper state reset between different syntax constructs.
