Let me analyze the syntax highlighting issues in the cshtml code:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `@helper` directive is not highlighted properly - it's treated as a regular Razor expression
**Cause**: The Prism syntax highlighter likely doesn't have specific rules to recognize and highlight the `@helper` directive, which is a special Razor syntax for defining reusable code blocks

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: C# code inside `@{ }` blocks has inconsistent highlighting - some C# keywords and strings are not properly colored
**Cause**: The parser may not be correctly identifying the scope of C# code blocks within Razor syntax, leading to improper language context switching between HTML and C#

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `@Localize.GetLabelHtml()` calls are not highlighted consistently with how Visual Studio renders them
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be treating these as simple Razor expressions rather than recognizing them as method calls that should have proper C# method highlighting

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: String literals within C# code (like `"PLACEHOLDER"`, `"Federico"`) don't have consistent string highlighting
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter seems to have trouble maintaining proper string token recognition when switching between HTML and C# contexts within Razor syntax

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: HTML attributes containing Razor expressions (like the placeholder attribute) aren't highlighted correctly
**Cause**: The parser likely struggles with properly handling nested Razor expressions within HTML attribute values, leading to incorrect tokenization

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be that Prism's cshtml/Razor syntax highlighter has several limitations in properly handling the complex interplay between HTML and C# code contexts. The main problems center around:
1. Missing support for Razor-specific directives
2. Inconsistent context switching between HTML and C# code blocks
3. Improper handling of nested expressions
4. Incomplete recognition of C# language constructs within Razor contexts
5. Poor handling of mixed HTML attribute values containing Razor expressions

These issues make the highlighting significantly different from Visual Studio's more sophisticated Razor syntax highlighting implementation.
