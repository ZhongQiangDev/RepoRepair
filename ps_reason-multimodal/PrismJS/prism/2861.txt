Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "type" attribute in the TypeScript interface is being highlighted as a keyword (in blue) when rendered by PrismJS, while GitHub renders it correctly as a regular property.
**Cause**: PrismJS's TypeScript syntax highlighting rules are incorrectly treating "type" as a reserved TypeScript keyword, when in this context it's actually being used as an interface property name. This is likely due to overly aggressive keyword matching in the syntax highlighting patterns.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting inconsistency between GitHub's renderer and PrismJS creates confusion for developers reading the code.
**Cause**: Different syntax highlighters (GitHub's vs PrismJS) are using different token classification rules. GitHub's implementation correctly recognizes context-sensitive usage of "type", while PrismJS version 1.23.0 appears to have a more simplistic approach that marks all instances of "type" as keywords.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from PrismJS incorrectly handling context-sensitive keywords in TypeScript. While "type" is indeed a keyword in TypeScript when used in certain contexts (like type aliases), it's perfectly valid as a property name in interfaces. The syntax highlighter needs to be smart enough to distinguish between these different uses. GitHub's renderer handles this correctly, while PrismJS 1.23.0 shows incorrect behavior by blindly highlighting "type" as a keyword regardless of context. This is likely a bug in PrismJS's TypeScript grammar definitions that needs to be updated to be more context-aware.
