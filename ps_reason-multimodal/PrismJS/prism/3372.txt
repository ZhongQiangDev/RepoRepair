### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram shows an additional "another customer" actor that is not defined in the PlantUML code.
**Cause**: The VSCode plugin might be interpreting the text "another customer" within the `actor "another customer" as au` line as a separate actor, even though it is intended to be an alias for the `au` actor.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram shows multiple connections from the "customer" actor to the "checkout" rectangle, which is not intended in the PlantUML code.
**Cause**: The VSCode plugin might be misinterpreting the `customer -- (checkout)` line, causing it to create multiple connections instead of a single connection.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram shows an extra "another customer" actor connected to the "checkout" rectangle, which is not defined in the PlantUML code.
**Cause**: The VSCode plugin might be misinterpreting the `actor "another customer" as au` line, causing it to create an additional actor and connect it to the "checkout" rectangle.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The VSCode plugin for PlantUML is misinterpreting certain lines of code, leading to the creation of additional actors and connections that are not intended in the original PlantUML code. This could be due to a bug in the plugin or an issue with how it handles certain syntax elements. To resolve these issues, the plugin may need to be updated or configured differently to correctly interpret the PlantUML code.
