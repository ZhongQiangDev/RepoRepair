From the provided GitHub problem description, it appears to be a feature request rather than a problem report. The user wants to add support for displaying images in Markdown. Let me analyze this:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Images are not being rendered/supported in the current implementation
**Cause**: Missing implementation of Markdown image syntax parsing and rendering functionality in the system

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The example image URL is not displaying in the description
**Cause**: Either:
1. The image rendering feature is not implemented yet
2. The markdown parser doesn't recognize the standard image syntax `![alt text](url)`

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Emoji-specific image handling may be missing
**Cause**: The system might need special handling for emoji images given the specific URL pattern shown (content.markdowner.net/emoji/...)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: This appears to be a feature request to add image support in a Markdown implementation. The main issues are:
1. Lack of basic image rendering support in Markdown
2. Missing implementation of standard Markdown image syntax
3. Potential need for specific emoji image handling

The primary focus should be on implementing the standard Markdown image syntax `![alt text](url)` to allow users to embed images in their content. This would include both general images and emoji-specific images as shown in the example.
