Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The single-package name 'baz' in the package declaration is not syntax highlighted, while multi-part package names are highlighted.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting grammar rules likely only recognize multi-part package names (those with dots) as valid package identifiers, missing the case for single-word package names.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting between import statement and package declaration
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to treat package declarations differently from import statements, even though both are package identifiers. 'foo' in the import statement gets highlighted while 'baz' in the package declaration doesn't.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from incomplete syntax highlighting rules in the Java grammar definition. The highlighter fails to properly recognize single-word package names in package declarations, while correctly highlighting package names in import statements. This creates an inconsistent visual experience for developers. The root cause appears to be in how the grammar rules are defined for package declarations versus import statements, where single-word package identifiers aren't properly tokenized in the package declaration context.

This is primarily a cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality but impacts code readability and consistency of the IDE's visual presentation.
