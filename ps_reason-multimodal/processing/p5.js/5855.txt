Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In MULTIPLY blend mode, text appears as solid rectangles instead of showing proper transparency for the text glyphs.
**Cause**: The alpha channel is being ignored during the MULTIPLY blend operation in WebGL. The blending is only considering the RGB values, treating the text's bounding rectangle as fully opaque rather than respecting the alpha values that define the text shapes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The overlapping text areas in MULTIPLY mode show incorrect color blending.
**Cause**: Since the alpha channel isn't being properly handled, the MULTIPLY blend mode is applying the multiplication operation to the entire rectangular area of the text bounds, rather than just the actual glyph shapes. This results in the wrong visual effect where the background color is being multiplied with the text color across the entire text bounding box.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between different blend modes (MULTIPLY vs ADD)
**Cause**: The ADD blend mode works correctly because it handles alpha differently in the WebGL pipeline. ADD blend mode combines colors additively while properly respecting transparency, while MULTIPLY mode's implementation in the WebGL renderer isn't properly configured to handle alpha transparency in text rendering.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper alpha channel handling in WebGL's MULTIPLY blend mode when rendering text. While the ADD blend mode correctly handles transparency, the MULTIPLY mode ignores alpha values, causing text to render as solid rectangles instead of properly shaped glyphs. This results in incorrect visual output when trying to blend transparent text elements. The problem appears to be specific to the WebGL renderer's implementation of the MULTIPLY blend mode and its interaction with text rendering.
