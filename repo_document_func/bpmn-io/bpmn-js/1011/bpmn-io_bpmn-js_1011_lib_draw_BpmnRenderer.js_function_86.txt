**function_86**: The function of function_86 is to determine and return the appropriate SVG path for a given BPMN element based on its type.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.  
Â· element: The BPMN element for which the SVG path needs to be generated. This element must have properties like `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` to define its position and dimensions.

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.  
This function, `getShapePath`, is a method of the `BpmnRenderer` prototype. It takes a BPMN `element` as input and returns an SVG path string that represents the shape of the element. The function checks the type of the element using the `is` function (assumed to be a type-checking utility) and delegates the path generation to specific helper functions based on the element type:  
1. If the element is of type `bpmn:Event`, it calls `getCirclePath` to generate a circular path.  
2. If the element is of type `bpmn:Activity`, it calls `getRoundRectPath` with a predefined `TASK_BORDER_RADIUS` to generate a rounded rectangle path.  
3. If the element is of type `bpmn:Gateway`, it calls `getDiamondPath` to generate a diamond-shaped path.  
4. For all other element types, it defaults to calling `getRectPath` to generate a rectangular path.  

The helper functions (`getCirclePath`, `getRoundRectPath`, `getDiamondPath`, and `getRectPath`) are imported from `BpmnRenderUtil.js` and are responsible for constructing the actual SVG path commands based on the element's dimensions and position. These paths are then converted into a string format using `componentsToPath` (assumed to be a utility function for path string construction).

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code.  
- The function relies on the `is` utility to check the element type, so ensure this utility is correctly implemented and available in the scope.  
- The `TASK_BORDER_RADIUS` constant must be defined elsewhere in the code for rounded rectangles to render correctly.  
- The element passed to this function must have the required properties (`x`, `y`, `width`, `height`) for accurate path generation.  

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.  
For a `bpmn:Event` element with `x = 10`, `y = 10`, `width = 20`, and `height = 20`, the output might look like:  
`"M 20 20 m 0 -10 a 10 10 0 1 1 0 20 a 10 10 0 1 1 0 -20 z"`
