**function_85**: The function of function_85 is to render a connection element in a BPMN diagram based on its type by delegating the rendering logic to a specific handler.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.  
· parentGfx: The parent graphics element where the connection will be drawn. This is typically a SVG group or container element.  
· element: The BPMN element representing the connection to be rendered. It contains properties like `type` to determine the specific rendering logic.  

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.  
The `drawConnection` function is a method of the `BpmnRenderer` prototype, designed to render connection elements in a BPMN diagram. It takes two parameters: `parentGfx` (the parent graphics container) and `element` (the BPMN connection element to render). The function first retrieves the `type` of the element, then looks up the corresponding handler from the `handlers` object stored in the renderer instance. The handler is invoked with the `parentGfx` and `element` arguments, and the result of the handler is returned.  

The comment `/* jshint -W040 */` temporarily disables a JSHint warning about the use of `this` in a potentially incorrect context, suggesting the handler is expected to be called with the correct `this` binding.  

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code  
1. The function assumes that a handler for the given `element.type` exists in the `handlers` object. If no handler is found, it may result in an error.  
2. The `handlers` object must be properly initialized in the `BpmnRenderer` instance before calling this function.  
3. The function relies on the correct binding of `this` within the handler, as indicated by the JSHint comment.  

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.  
The return value depends on the specific handler invoked. For example, if the handler renders an SVG path for a sequence flow, it might return an SVG path element:  
```javascript
<path d="M 100 100 L 200 200" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" fill="none" />
```
