**function_84**: The function of function_84 is to render a shape in a BPMN diagram based on the given element type by delegating the drawing task to a specific handler.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.  
· parentGfx: The parent graphics element where the shape will be drawn. This is typically a SVG group or container.  
· element: The BPMN element object that contains the type and other properties needed to render the shape.  

**Code Description**: The description of this Function.  
This function is part of the `BpmnRenderer` prototype and is responsible for drawing shapes in a BPMN diagram. It takes two parameters: `parentGfx` (the parent graphics container) and `element` (the BPMN element to be rendered). The function first extracts the `type` property from the `element` object. It then retrieves the corresponding handler function from the `handlers` object, which is indexed by the element type. The handler function is then invoked with the `parentGfx` and `element` as arguments, and the result of this invocation is returned.  

The comment `/* jshint -W040 */` is used to suppress a JSHint warning about the use of `this` in a potentially incorrect context, indicating that the function is intentionally using the current context (`this.handlers`).  

**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code  
1. The function relies on the `handlers` object being properly initialized with handler functions for all expected BPMN element types.  
2. The `element` object must have a `type` property that matches a key in the `handlers` object.  
3. The function assumes the handler function will return a value, which is then passed through as the return value of `drawShape`.  

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.  
The return value depends on the specific handler function invoked. For example, if the handler draws a task shape, it might return an SVG group element representing the task.  

Example return value (simplified):  
```javascript
<g class="djs-visual">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="80" fill="white" stroke="black"></rect>
  <text x="60" y="50" text-anchor="middle">Task</text>
</g>
```
