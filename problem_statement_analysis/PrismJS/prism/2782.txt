### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The first line of code is not correctly highlighted, indicating that the opening quotes are not recognized when an '@' symbol is included within the string.
**Cause**: The current string pattern in `prism-basic.js` does not include the '@' symbol as a valid character within a string. This causes the parser to misinterpret the '@' symbol as the end of the string, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The second line of code works correctly, with proper highlighting of the string.
**Cause**: The second line of code does not include an '@' symbol within the string, so the current string pattern in `prism-basic.js` correctly identifies the opening and closing quotes, resulting in proper highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the current string pattern in `prism-basic.js` does not include the '@' symbol as a valid character within a string. This causes the parser to misinterpret the '@' symbol as the end of the string, leading to incorrect highlighting in the first line of code. The second line of code works correctly because it does not include an '@' symbol within the string. To fix this issue, the '@' symbol should be added to the string pattern in `prism-basic.js`. However, it is important to be cautious of potential regression issues on other languages that extend it.
