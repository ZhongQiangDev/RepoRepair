Let me analyze the GitHub issue and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `#` symbol within URLs is being incorrectly tokenized as a shell comment symbol
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting parser is treating the `#` character as a shell comment marker even when it appears within a URL string, where it should be treated as part of the URL text. This suggests the parser lacks proper context awareness for different string types.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text after the `#` in the URL is being visually styled as a comment
**Cause**: As a direct result of the incorrect tokenization, the syntax highlighter is applying comment styling rules to the portion of the URL after the `#` symbol, when the entire URL should maintain consistent styling as a single text entity.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the syntax highlighter's handling of the `#` symbol in shell sessions. The parser is too aggressive in identifying `#` as a shell comment marker without considering its context within URLs. This results in both incorrect tokenization and visual styling problems. The fix would likely require updating the shell session grammar rules to properly handle URLs and other special cases where `#` should not be treated as a comment delimiter.

The issue is particularly visible in documentation and help text where URLs containing hash fragments are common, making this a notable usability concern for technical documentation.
