### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The backtick character (`) is not being properly highlighted as a template literal in the JavaScript code.
**Cause**: The current grammar for template literals in the Prism JavaScript language definition might not be correctly configured to handle the backtick character in all contexts. Specifically, the pattern for template literals may not be capturing the backtick correctly when it appears in certain positions within the code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `var` keyword is not highlighted as a keyword in the JavaScript code.
**Cause**: The keyword pattern in the Prism JavaScript language definition might not be capturing the `var` keyword correctly. This could be due to the pattern not being inclusive of all possible keyword contexts or the pattern being overridden by other patterns in the grammar.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `STATUS_ATTR`, `STATUS_LOADING`, `STATUS_LOADED`, and `STATUS_FAILED` constants are not highlighted as constants.
**Cause**: The constant pattern in the Prism JavaScript language definition might not be capturing these specific constants. The pattern for constants may need to be adjusted to include these specific variable names or the pattern might be too restrictive.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The `SELECTOR` variable is not highlighted as a string.
**Cause**: The string pattern in the Prism JavaScript language definition might not be capturing the string value assigned to `SELECTOR` correctly. This could be due to the string pattern not being inclusive of all possible string contexts or the pattern being overridden by other patterns in the grammar.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues identified are primarily related to the grammar patterns in the Prism JavaScript language definition not capturing certain elements correctly. The backtick character, `var` keyword, constants, and string values are not being highlighted as expected. Adjusting the grammar patterns to be more inclusive and specific to these elements should resolve the highlighting issues. Specifically, the template literal, keyword, constant, and string patterns need to be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure they correctly capture the relevant elements in the code.
