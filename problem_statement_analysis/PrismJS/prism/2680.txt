Let me analyze the GitHub issue and provide a structured response:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code highlighting breaks when scrolling down to about 90% of the page, specifically around a backtick character
**Cause**: Based on the code and screenshot, this appears to be an issue with the template string parsing in the JavaScript language definition. The backtick (`) character is being incorrectly handled as a string delimiter when it appears in code comments or documentation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting is not properly handling documentation blocks containing code examples with backticks
**Cause**: The regex pattern for template strings in Prism's JavaScript language definition is too greedy and doesn't properly account for backticks appearing within documentation comments. The pattern `/`(?:\\[\s\S]|\${(?:[^{}]|{(?:[^{}]|{[^}]*})*})+}|(?!\${)[^\\`])*`/` is matching across comment boundaries.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment highlighting breaks after encountering a code example in documentation
**Cause**: The comment tokenizer in the JavaScript language definition is not properly coordinating with the template string tokenizer, leading to incorrect token boundaries when comments contain code examples using backticks.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prism.js's JavaScript syntax highlighting having conflicting patterns between template strings and documentation comments. The backtick character serves dual purposes - as both a template string delimiter and as a code block marker in documentation. The current implementation doesn't properly handle this ambiguity, causing the highlighting to break when these patterns intersect. The tokenizer needs to be updated to properly recognize context and prevent the template string pattern from matching across comment boundaries.

The fix would likely involve:
1. Modifying the template string regex to be less greedy
2. Adding proper look-behind/look-ahead assertions to respect comment boundaries
3. Improving coordination between the comment and template string tokenizers
4. Potentially adding special handling for documentation code blocks
