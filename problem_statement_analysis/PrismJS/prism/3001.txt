### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The keyword `infer` is incorrectly highlighted as a keyword when followed by an alphabetic character, such as in `inference`.
**Cause**: The highlighting engine is not correctly distinguishing between the standalone keyword `infer` and its usage as part of another word. It is treating `infer` as a keyword even when it is part of a larger word like `inference`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The keyword `type` is incorrectly highlighted as a keyword when followed by an alphabetic character, such as in `typeDefs`.
**Cause**: Similar to the `infer` issue, the highlighting engine is not properly recognizing the boundary between the keyword `type` and the subsequent characters, leading it to treat `type` as a keyword even within a larger word like `typeDefs`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The keyword `const` is correctly highlighted as a keyword when followed by an alphabetic character, such as in `constants`.
**Cause**: The highlighting engine correctly identifies `const` as a standalone keyword and does not treat it as part of a larger word like `constants`. This indicates that the issue is specific to certain keywords and not a general problem with the highlighting engine.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue lies in the highlighting engine's inability to correctly distinguish between standalone TypeScript keywords (`infer`, `type`) and their usage as part of larger words (`inference`, `typeDefs`). The engine is treating these keywords as keywords even when they are part of other words, leading to incorrect highlighting. The `const` keyword, however, is correctly handled, suggesting that the problem is specific to certain keywords and not a general issue with the highlighting engine. To fix this, the highlighting engine needs to be updated to correctly recognize the boundaries of these specific keywords.
