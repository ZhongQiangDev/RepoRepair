### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The YAML string `"world"` with a trailing comment `# test` is not properly highlighted.
**Cause**: The Prism.js YAML parser might not be correctly handling the syntax where a string is followed by a comment on the same line. This could be due to the parser not recognizing the comment syntax after a string, causing it to misinterpret the string and comment as a single entity.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment `# test` following the string `"world"` is not highlighted as a comment.
**Cause**: The Prism.js YAML grammar might not be configured to recognize comments immediately following a string. This could be due to the grammar rules not accounting for the specific case where a comment follows a string on the same line, leading to improper syntax highlighting.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The second string `"world"` without a trailing comment is highlighted correctly, but the first string with the comment is not.
**Cause**: There might be a discrepancy in how Prism.js handles strings with and without trailing comments. The parser might be treating the string with the comment as an invalid syntax, causing it to fail to highlight the string correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Prism.js is not correctly handling YAML strings with trailing comments. The parser is likely misinterpreting the syntax, leading to improper highlighting of both the string and the comment. To resolve this, the YAML grammar in Prism.js needs to be updated to correctly recognize and handle strings followed by comments on the same line. This would ensure that both the string and the comment are highlighted appropriately.
