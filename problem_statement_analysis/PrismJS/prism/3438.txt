### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The URL string is not highlighted as a single entity.
**Cause**: The CSS syntax highlighter is incorrectly parsing the URL string, treating parts of the URL as separate tokens instead of recognizing it as a single URL string.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `@import` directive and the `url()` function are highlighted correctly, but the URL inside the `url()` function is not.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter may not be properly configured to handle URLs within the `url()` function in CSS. It might be treating the URL as plain text or breaking it down into smaller parts due to the presence of special characters like `?`, `&`, and `=`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior shows the entire URL string highlighted in a single color, but the actual behavior shows different parts of the URL highlighted in different colors.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter might be using a regex pattern that does not correctly match the entire URL string. This could be due to the regex pattern not accounting for all possible characters and structures within a URL.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the CSS syntax highlighter is not correctly recognizing and highlighting the URL string within the `url()` function. This could be due to incorrect parsing of the URL string, improper handling of special characters within the URL, or an inadequate regex pattern used by the highlighter. To fix this, the syntax highlighter's configuration or regex pattern needs to be updated to correctly identify and highlight the entire URL string as a single entity.
