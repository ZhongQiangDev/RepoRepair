Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The URL string within the @import statement is not being highlighted as a single continuous string
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter (Prism.js) appears to be incorrectly parsing the URL string, breaking it at special characters (like ':' and '?') instead of treating the entire content within quotes as a single string literal

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Special characters within the URL are being highlighted differently
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is interpreting special characters like ':', '?', '&', and '=' as CSS operators or special tokens rather than treating them as part of the URL string content

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The color consistency of the URL string is broken
**Cause**: The highlighter's CSS tokenizer rules are likely prioritizing operator/special character highlighting rules over string literal rules, causing inconsistent coloring throughout the URL

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prism.js's CSS syntax highlighting engine incorrectly tokenizing URL strings in @import statements. Instead of treating the entire URL as a single string token, it's breaking the URL into multiple tokens at special characters. This results in inconsistent highlighting colors and incorrect visual representation of the code. The expected behavior should show the entire URL as a single, consistently colored string token, as shown in the "Expected behavior" screenshot.

The fix would likely require adjusting Prism.js's CSS language definition to properly handle URL strings within @import statements, ensuring that content within quotes is treated as a single string token regardless of the special characters it contains.
