### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `!important` flag is not recognized as a separate token when it is specified together with a CSS value in a single statement.
**Cause**: The CSS tokenizer might be failing to properly parse the `!important` flag when it is directly attached to a value without a space. This could be due to the tokenizer's rules not accounting for the `!important` flag when it is immediately adjacent to a value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `!important` flag is correctly recognized as a separate token when there is a space between the CSS value and the `!important` flag.
**Cause**: The CSS tokenizer likely has rules that correctly identify the `!important` flag when it is separated by a space. This indicates that the tokenizer's parsing logic is dependent on the presence of a space to distinguish the `!important` flag from the preceding value.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `!important` flag is correctly recognized as a separate token when it is used in a multi-line CSS rule.
**Cause**: The CSS tokenizer appears to handle multi-line rules correctly, likely because the parsing logic is designed to process each line or property-value pair independently. This allows the `!important` flag to be recognized even when it is part of a larger, multi-line rule.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The `!important` flag is correctly recognized as a separate token when it is used in an inline style attribute.
**Cause**: The CSS tokenizer seems to handle inline styles correctly, possibly because the parsing logic for inline styles is more robust or flexible. This allows the `!important` flag to be recognized even when it is part of a single, inline style declaration.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be with the CSS tokenizer's ability to recognize the `!important` flag when it is directly attached to a CSS value without a space. The tokenizer works correctly when there is a space between the value and the `!important` flag, in multi-line rules, and in inline styles. This suggests that the tokenizer's parsing rules need to be updated to account for the `!important` flag when it is immediately adjacent to a value. Improving the tokenizer's ability to handle this case would ensure consistent recognition of the `!important` flag in all scenarios.
