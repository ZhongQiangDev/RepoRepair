### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: F# type annotations are not highlighted in the first image.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting configuration for F# in the current editor or IDE is not properly set up to recognize and highlight type annotations. This could be due to missing or outdated language support extensions, incorrect settings, or a bug in the editor's syntax highlighting engine.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The desired result (as shown in the second image) displays proper highlighting for type annotations, which is not reflected in the first image.
**Cause**: The editor or IDE used in the first image might not have the same level of F# language support as Visual Studio, which is known for its robust F# tooling. This discrepancy could be due to differences in the language service implementations or the absence of specific F# syntax highlighting rules in the editor's configuration.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The type annotations in the first image appear in the same color as regular code, making them less distinguishable.
**Cause**: The color scheme or theme applied in the editor might not have distinct colors assigned to type annotations. This could be a result of a generic theme that does not differentiate between various syntax elements or a custom theme that lacks specific styling for F# type annotations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the editor's syntax highlighting configuration and language support for F#. The wrong behaviors stem from missing or incorrect language extensions, differences in language service implementations between editors, and insufficient color differentiation in the editor's theme. To resolve these issues, updating the editor's F# language support, ensuring the correct syntax highlighting rules are applied, and using a theme that properly distinguishes type annotations would be necessary steps.
