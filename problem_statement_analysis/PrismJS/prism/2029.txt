Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Single quotes within double-quoted strings are incorrectly highlighted/parsed in the D language syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter (Prism) appears to be incorrectly treating single quotes inside double-quoted strings as string delimiters, when in D they should be treated as literal characters within the string

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting between regular strings and WYSIWYG strings
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter doesn't properly recognize D's WYSIWYG string syntax (using backticks) and its equivalence to r"" syntax, leading to different highlighting behaviors for what should be equivalent string representations

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting doesn't follow D language specifications for string literals
**Cause**: The implementation of the D language syntax rules in Prism doesn't fully comply with D's lexical specifications (as referenced in https://dlang.org/spec/lex.html#wysiwyg), particularly regarding string literal handling

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around Prism's incorrect handling of D language string literals, specifically:
1. Improper parsing of single quotes within double-quoted strings
2. Inconsistent treatment of WYSIWYG strings (backtick-quoted) versus regular strings
3. Non-compliance with D language specifications for string literals

The root cause appears to be incomplete or incorrect implementation of D's string literal rules in Prism's syntax highlighting engine, which needs to be updated to properly handle all D string literal cases according to the language specification.
