### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect highlighting of single quotes within double-quoted strings.
**Cause**: Prism's syntax highlighting for the D language does not properly handle the escape sequence for single quotes within double-quoted strings. The presence of the single quote (`'`) within the double-quoted string (`"`) is causing the syntax highlighter to misinterpret the string's termination, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect highlighting of WYSIWYG strings enclosed in backticks.
**Cause**: Prism's syntax highlighting for the D language does not recognize backtick-enclosed strings (```) as WYSIWYG strings. This results in the content within the backticks being incorrectly highlighted as regular code rather than as string literals.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from Prism's D language syntax highlighting not correctly handling specific string formats in the D programming language. The first issue involves the incorrect handling of single quotes within double-quoted strings, while the second issue involves the lack of recognition for WYSIWYG strings enclosed in backticks. Both problems require updates to Prism's D language grammar to correctly identify and highlight these string formats.
