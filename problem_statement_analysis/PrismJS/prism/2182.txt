### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The attribute name `attribute?:` is not being correctly identified as a token in the PrismJS syntax highlighting for Elixir.
**Cause**: The regex pattern used to identify attribute names in the PrismJS Elixir component is missing the optional question mark at the end. The current pattern does not account for attributes that end with a `?`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting on the PrismJS test website does not properly highlight `attribute?:` as an attribute name.
**Cause**: The regex pattern for `attr-name` in the PrismJS Elixir component is not correctly configured to recognize attributes that end with a `?`. This results in the `attribute?:` not being highlighted as expected.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the regex pattern for identifying attribute names in the PrismJS Elixir component does not include the optional question mark at the end. This causes attributes ending with a `?` to not be correctly identified and highlighted. The suggested fix is to modify the regex pattern to include the optional question mark, ensuring that attributes like `attribute?:` are properly recognized and highlighted. This change would align the PrismJS syntax highlighting with the correct Elixir syntax and match the behavior seen in GitHub's syntax highlighting.
