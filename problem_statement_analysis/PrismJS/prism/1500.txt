### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The SQL comment `-- this is a comment` is not properly highlighted as a comment.
**Cause**: The SQL syntax highlighting tool (Prism.js in this case) might be misinterpreting the single quotes within the string literal `'select ''hello world'' from a'` as the end of the string, causing it to incorrectly parse the subsequent text. This can lead to the comment not being recognized as such.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The second `INSERT INTO` statement is incorrectly highlighted as if it were part of a string.
**Cause**: The same issue as in Answer 1 is causing the syntax highlighting tool to misinterpret the string literal. The tool fails to recognize the closing single quote of the string literal in the first `INSERT INTO` statement, leading it to treat the subsequent SQL code as part of the string.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the misinterpretation of the string literal containing single quotes by the SQL syntax highlighting tool. This causes the comment to not be recognized and the subsequent SQL code to be incorrectly highlighted. To fix this, the syntax highlighting tool needs to be updated to correctly handle string literals with escaped single quotes.
