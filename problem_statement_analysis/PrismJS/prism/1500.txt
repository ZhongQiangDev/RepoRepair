Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The SQL comment (starting with --) is incorrectly highlighting the subsequent SQL statement in gray (comment color).
**Cause**: PrismJS syntax highlighter is not properly terminating the SQL comment at the end of the line. It's treating everything after the -- comment as part of the comment, which is incorrect as SQL single-line comments should only extend to the end of the current line.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The string literals ('hello world') in the SQL statements are not being highlighted distinctly from regular SQL code.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be failing to properly recognize and highlight string literals within the SQL statements, which should typically be highlighted differently from SQL keywords and regular code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The SQL keywords (INSERT INTO, VALUES, SELECT, FROM) in the second statement are not highlighted as keywords due to being incorrectly treated as comments.
**Cause**: This is a direct consequence of the comment parsing issue, where the syntax highlighter is failing to recognize that new SQL statements after a comment line should be treated as active code rather than continuation of the comment.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from PrismJS's incorrect handling of SQL single-line comments (--), where it fails to properly terminate the comment at the end of the line. This causes a cascade of highlighting issues: subsequent SQL code is treated as comments, keywords lose their proper highlighting, and string literals are not distinctly marked. The syntax highlighter needs to be fixed to properly handle SQL comment termination at line breaks, which would resolve all the identified highlighting issues.
