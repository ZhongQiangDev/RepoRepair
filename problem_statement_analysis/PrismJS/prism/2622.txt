### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code snippet is not being highlighted correctly as Apex code.
**Cause**: The current setup is using the Java language definition for highlighting Apex code, which may not fully capture the unique syntax and keywords specific to Apex. This can lead to incorrect highlighting and a lack of proper syntax recognition.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The 'display language' addon shows the code as Java instead of Apex.
**Cause**: The current implementation uses an alias for the Java language to represent Apex. This aliasing approach does not change the display language in the 'display language' addon, resulting in the code being labeled as Java instead of Apex.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The proposed solution of creating a new language definition for Apex seems overkill.
**Cause**: While Apex shares similarities with Java, it has its own unique syntax, keywords, and features. Creating a new language definition would ensure proper syntax highlighting and recognition but might be seen as excessive if the differences are not significant enough to warrant a separate definition.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are incorrect syntax highlighting and improper display of the language as Apex. The cause is the current reliance on the Java language definition for Apex, which does not fully capture Apex's unique features. While creating a new language definition could solve these issues, it may be seen as overkill. A balanced approach could involve extending the Java definition with Apex-specific syntax and keywords to achieve proper highlighting without the need for a completely new definition.
