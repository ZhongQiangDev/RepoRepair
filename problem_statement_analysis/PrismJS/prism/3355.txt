### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `@Localize.GetLabelHtml("PLACEHOLDER")` and `@Localize.GetLabelHtml("TITLE")` expressions are not highlighted correctly in the input placeholder and h1 tag.
**Cause**: The current version of Prism does not properly recognize and highlight Razor expressions within HTML attributes and tags. This is likely due to limitations in the grammar rules used by Prism for parsing and highlighting cshtml files.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `@helper` keyword and its associated block are not highlighted correctly.
**Cause**: The `@helper` keyword is a legacy feature in Razor that has been replaced by `@functions` in newer versions of ASP.NET Core. Prism may not have updated its grammar rules to properly recognize and highlight this legacy syntax, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `@{ ... }` block is not highlighted correctly.
**Cause**: The `@{ ... }` block is used to write C# code within a cshtml file. Prism may not be correctly identifying and highlighting this block as C# code, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The incorrect highlighting of Razor expressions within HTML attributes and tags, the `@helper` keyword and its associated block, and the `@{ ... }` block are all caused by limitations in the grammar rules used by Prism for parsing and highlighting cshtml files. These limitations may be due to the legacy nature of some Razor syntax and the need for Prism to be updated to properly recognize and highlight these features.
