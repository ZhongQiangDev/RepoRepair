### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: PrismJS does not highlight the class name `QMainWindow` in the inheritance declaration `class MainWindow : public QMainWindow`.
**Cause**: The PrismJS C++ grammar definition might not be recognizing `QMainWindow` as a class name in the context of inheritance. It could be missing specific rules or patterns that identify class names used in inheritance.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: PrismJS does not highlight the class name `MainWindow` in the function definition `void MainWindow::changeWindowTitle()`.
**Cause**: The PrismJS C++ grammar definition might not be recognizing class names in the context of function definitions outside the class declaration. It could be missing rules that identify class names used in scope resolution (`::`).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues arise from limitations in the PrismJS C++ grammar definition. Specifically, it lacks the necessary rules to correctly identify and highlight class names in the context of inheritance and function definitions outside the class declaration. To fix these issues, the grammar definition would need to be updated to include patterns that recognize these specific contexts. GitHub's code highlighting works correctly because it likely has a more comprehensive or different set of rules for identifying class names in these contexts.
