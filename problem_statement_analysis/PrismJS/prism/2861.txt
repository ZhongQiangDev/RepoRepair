### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: PrismJS incorrectly identifies the "type" attribute as a keyword, causing it to be highlighted in a different color than other attributes.
**Cause**: The PrismJS TypeScript grammar configuration may be outdated or incorrectly configured, leading it to treat "type" as a reserved keyword instead of a regular attribute name.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting discrepancy between GitHub and PrismJS suggests that the two platforms use different syntax highlighting configurations or libraries.
**Cause**: GitHub likely uses a more up-to-date or customized TypeScript grammar configuration that correctly identifies "type" as an attribute, while PrismJS may be using an older or less accurate configuration.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The "type" attribute is not being highlighted consistently across different rendering environments.
**Cause**: The inconsistency may be due to differences in the versions of the TypeScript grammar used by each platform, or differences in how each platform applies its syntax highlighting rules.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that PrismJS is incorrectly identifying the "type" attribute as a keyword, likely due to an outdated or incorrect TypeScript grammar configuration. This discrepancy is further highlighted by the difference in rendering between GitHub and PrismJS, suggesting that GitHub uses a more accurate or up-to-date configuration. To resolve this issue, the PrismJS TypeScript grammar configuration should be updated or corrected to properly identify "type" as an attribute.
