Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Single quotes within numeric literals are being interpreted as string delimiters instead of digit separators
**Cause**: The current syntax highlighting regex pattern in Prism treats single quotes as string markers, causing the numbers to be incorrectly split and partially highlighted as strings

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting of hexadecimal numbers with single quote separators (e.g., 0x10'0000)
**Cause**: The current regex pattern in components/prism-cpp.js doesn't properly handle single quotes in hexadecimal number representations

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect highlighting of floating-point numbers with single quote separators (e.g., 1.602'176'565e-19)
**Cause**: The floating-point number regex pattern doesn't account for single quotes as valid digit separators in the mantissa and exponent parts

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Octal numbers with single quote separators (e.g., 0'004'000'000) are not properly highlighted
**Cause**: The current regex pattern doesn't recognize single quotes as valid separators in octal number representations

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prism's syntax highlighting engine not properly supporting C++'s single quote digit separators in numeric literals. The current regex patterns need to be updated to treat single quotes as valid digit separators rather than string delimiters. This affects all types of numeric literals in C++ (decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and floating-point numbers). The attempted fix by modifying the regex pattern wasn't successful because the single quotes are still being interpreted with higher precedence as string delimiters rather than as part of the number pattern.
