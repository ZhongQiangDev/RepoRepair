Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect syntax highlighting when using spread operator for props in JSX components with Prism.js
**Cause**: Prism.js's JSX grammar rules likely don't properly handle the spread operator syntax (`{...{props}}`) within JSX component attributes, causing the highlighting engine to fail in recognizing this pattern correctly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between Prism.js and GitHub's syntax highlighting for the same JSX code
**Cause**: GitHub uses its own syntax highlighting engine (Linguist) which has better support for modern JSX patterns including spread operators, while Prism.js appears to have limitations in its JSX grammar definitions for these cases.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Related issues with nested objects inside props, suggesting a broader problem with complex prop structures
**Cause**: As referenced in the linked issues (#2598 and #1548), Prism.js seems to have ongoing challenges with properly parsing and highlighting nested JavaScript expressions within JSX, particularly when dealing with object literals and spread operations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prism.js's limited capability to properly handle modern JSX syntax patterns, specifically when using the spread operator with object literals as props. This manifests as incorrect syntax highlighting, which is particularly noticeable when compared to GitHub's more robust highlighting implementation. The problem appears to be part of a broader limitation in Prism.js's handling of complex JavaScript expressions within JSX attributes, as evidenced by similar issues with nested objects in props. This suggests that a fundamental update to Prism.js's JSX grammar rules might be needed to properly support these modern JavaScript patterns.
