### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prism's syntax highlighting breaks when props are spread in JSX components.
**Cause**: Prism's current implementation of JSX highlighting does not properly handle the spread operator (`...`) within JSX attributes. This causes the syntax highlighting engine to misinterpret the structure of the JSX, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The first `Button` component with spread props is not highlighted correctly.
**Cause**: The spread operator (`...`) is being used to pass an object containing `onClick` and `disabled` as props. Prism's highlighting logic fails to recognize this pattern, resulting in the incorrect highlighting of the component's content.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The second `Button` component with explicit props is highlighted correctly.
**Cause**: When props are explicitly defined (e.g., `onClick={onClick}` and `disabled={disabled}`), Prism's syntax highlighting engine can correctly identify and highlight the JSX structure. This indicates that the issue is specific to the spread operator and not a general problem with JSX highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Prism's syntax highlighting for JSX does not correctly handle the spread operator within JSX attributes. This causes the first `Button` component to be highlighted incorrectly. The second `Button` component, which uses explicit props, is highlighted correctly, indicating that the problem is specific to the spread operator. To fix this, Prism's JSX highlighting logic needs to be updated to properly recognize and handle the spread operator within JSX attributes.
