Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Comment syntax highlighting breaks when using line continuation character (_) in Visual Basic
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be treating each line as a separate token/comment, rather than recognizing the line continuation character (_) as joining multiple lines into a single comment block

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent coloring of comment lines after the continuation character
**Cause**: The tokenizer likely processes comments line-by-line instead of looking ahead for line continuation characters, causing it to lose the comment context for subsequent lines

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The line continuation character (_) at the end of commented lines is not being properly recognized as part of the comment syntax
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting engine may not have proper rules implemented to handle the specific case of line continuation characters within comments in Visual Basic

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the syntax highlighter's inability to properly handle Visual Basic's line continuation character (_) within comments. This results in broken comment highlighting across multiple lines, inconsistent coloring, and improper recognition of the continuation character itself. The tokenizer needs to be updated to treat continued comment lines as a single logical unit rather than processing each line independently. This would require implementing proper look-ahead functionality to detect line continuation characters and maintain comment context across multiple lines.
