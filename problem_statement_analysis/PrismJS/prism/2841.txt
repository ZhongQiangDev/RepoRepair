### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Interpolation in Regex `/foo#{bar}/` is not highlighted for Ruby.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting engine used by Prism.js may not be correctly recognizing the interpolation syntax when it is used within the `/.../` regex delimiters. This could be due to the engine's regex pattern for identifying interpolation not being comprehensive enough to cover this specific case.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Interpolation is highlighted correctly with `%r{...}` but not with `/.../`.
**Cause**: The `%r{...}` syntax is likely handled differently by the syntax highlighting engine. It may have a more specific rule or pattern for recognizing and highlighting interpolation within `%r{...}` delimiters, whereas the `/.../` delimiters might be using a more generic pattern that does not account for interpolation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue arises from the syntax highlighting engine's handling of interpolation within different regex delimiters in Ruby. The engine correctly identifies and highlights interpolation within `%r{...}` but fails to do so within `/.../`. This discrepancy suggests that the engine's rules or patterns for recognizing interpolation need to be updated or expanded to cover both types of delimiters consistently. Adjusting the engine's regex patterns or adding specific rules for interpolation within `/.../` delimiters could resolve the problem.
