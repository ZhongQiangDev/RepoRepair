Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Empty string ('') in Smalltalk code is not highlighted correctly in PrismJS syntax highlighting
**Cause**: PrismJS's Smalltalk syntax highlighting rules likely don't have proper pattern matching for empty strings, causing them to be treated as regular text instead of string literals

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between different syntax highlighters (PrismJS vs Rouge) for the same Smalltalk code
**Cause**: Rouge has implemented correct handling of empty strings in its Smalltalk grammar rules, while PrismJS has not properly implemented this edge case in its syntax definitions

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The method parameter 'shouldBeGreenHere' is not highlighted correctly in PrismJS
**Cause**: PrismJS's token recognition for Smalltalk method parameters appears to be failing when preceded by an empty string parameter, suggesting an issue with the token parsing sequence or regular expression patterns

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around PrismJS's inadequate handling of Smalltalk syntax, specifically with empty strings. This manifests in three ways: incorrect highlighting of empty strings, inconsistency with other syntax highlighters like Rouge, and incorrect highlighting of subsequent method parameters. The main technical cause appears to be incomplete or incorrect grammar rules in PrismJS's Smalltalk syntax definition, particularly around empty string handling and its impact on surrounding token recognition. Rouge's correct handling of the same code suggests this is a PrismJS-specific implementation issue rather than a fundamental syntax highlighting limitation.
