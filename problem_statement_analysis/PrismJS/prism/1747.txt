### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The empty string `''` is not correctly identified as a string literal in the code snippet, causing the subsequent code to be incorrectly highlighted.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting library used (Prism.js) may not have the correct grammar rules for Smalltalk, specifically for handling empty strings. This results in the parser not recognizing the empty string as a valid string literal, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text following the empty string `''` is not highlighted correctly, as it should be treated as part of the method call but is instead highlighted as if it were part of the string.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting library may be prematurely ending the string literal detection when it encounters the empty string `''`, causing it to incorrectly interpret the following text as part of the string. This can be due to a lack of specific handling for empty strings in the grammar rules of the library.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The correct highlighting is observed in Rouge, indicating that the issue is specific to Prism.js and not a general problem with Smalltalk syntax.
**Cause**: The difference in behavior between Prism.js and Rouge suggests that the issue lies in the implementation of the Smalltalk grammar within Prism.js. Rouge may have more comprehensive or accurate grammar rules for handling Smalltalk syntax, including empty strings, which allows it to correctly highlight the code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Prism.js does not correctly handle empty strings in Smalltalk syntax, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. This is likely due to a lack of specific grammar rules for empty strings in the library. The correct highlighting observed in Rouge indicates that the issue can be resolved by updating or modifying the Smalltalk grammar rules in Prism.js to properly handle empty strings.
