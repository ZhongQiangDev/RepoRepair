### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The SQL tick marks (`) are not being highlighted as strings.
**Cause**: The current syntax highlighting configuration for SQL in the code editor does not recognize the backtick (`) as a string delimiter. The regular expression used for identifying strings in the SQL language definition does not include the backtick character as a valid string delimiter.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code editor does not apply the correct formatting to the text within the backticks.
**Cause**: The existing Prism language definition for SQL lacks the necessary pattern to match and highlight text enclosed in backticks as strings. The provided solution updates the 'string' pattern in the Prism language definition to include the backtick character, allowing it to be recognized as a string delimiter.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the SQL syntax highlighting in the code editor does not recognize backticks as string delimiters, leading to incorrect formatting. This is caused by the absence of the backtick character in the regular expression used to identify strings in the SQL language definition. The suggested solution updates the language definition to include backticks as valid string delimiters, ensuring that text within backticks is correctly highlighted as strings.
