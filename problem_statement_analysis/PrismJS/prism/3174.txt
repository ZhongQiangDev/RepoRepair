Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Swift keyword 'isolated' is not being highlighted properly in function parameter type declarations
**Cause**: The current syntax highlighting rules in Prism.js for Swift don't recognize 'isolated' as a keyword when it appears before function body parameter types. This suggests the keyword pattern matching for Swift needs to be updated to include newer Swift keywords and handle their usage in parameter type contexts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is a gap in Swift syntax highlighting where newer language keywords (specifically 'isolated') aren't properly highlighted in all contexts. While PR #3022 improved Swift highlighting overall, there are still edge cases where keyword highlighting isn't comprehensive enough. The solution would likely involve updating the keyword patterns in Prism.js's Swift language definition to include newer keywords and ensure they're recognized in all valid syntactic positions, including parameter type declarations.

The problem appears to be relatively minor since the submitter mentions this is the only issue they could find, indicating that Swift syntax highlighting is generally working well otherwise.
