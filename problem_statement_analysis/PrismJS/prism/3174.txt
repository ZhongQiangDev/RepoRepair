### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The keyword `isolated` in the function parameter type is not highlighted as a keyword.
**Cause**: The current syntax highlighting configuration for Swift in PrismJS does not include `isolated` as a recognized keyword. This means that the highlighting rules need to be updated to recognize `isolated` as a keyword in the context of function parameter types.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue identified is that the keyword `isolated` is not being highlighted correctly in the function parameter type context. This is due to the current syntax highlighting configuration not recognizing `isolated` as a keyword. Updating the syntax highlighting rules to include `isolated` as a keyword will resolve this issue.
