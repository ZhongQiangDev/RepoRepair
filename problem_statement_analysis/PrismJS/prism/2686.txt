### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Shell session" language does not tokenize correctly in the recent downloads of Prism version 1.22 and 1.23, as well as on the Prism Test Drive page. The expected syntax highlighting is missing, and the text appears as plain text without any color coding.

**Cause**: There seems to be an issue with the download generation code for the "Shell session" language tokenizer. This could be due to a bug introduced in the code responsible for generating the tokenizer for this specific language. The tokenizer might not be properly included or configured in the recent downloads, leading to the lack of syntax highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The DOM tree of the test drive page shows that the tokenizer is not working correctly for the "Shell session" language. The entire code block is wrapped in a single `<span>` element with the class "token output," indicating that the tokenizer is not breaking down the code into individual tokens.

**Cause**: The issue might be related to how the tokenizer is being applied to the "Shell session" language. The tokenizer might not be recognizing the specific patterns or rules for this language, resulting in the entire code block being treated as a single output token. This could be due to a change in the tokenizer rules or a problem with the language definition file for "Shell session."

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting works fine with an earlier download of Prism version 1.22, but not with the recent downloads and the Test Drive page. This inconsistency suggests a regression in the recent updates.

**Cause**: The regression might be caused by a change in the build process or a modification in the language definition files. The earlier version of Prism that works correctly might have a different configuration or a different version of the "Shell session" language definition file. The recent updates might have inadvertently altered or removed some crucial components required for the correct functioning of the tokenizer for this language.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the "Shell session" language tokenizer is not working correctly in the recent downloads of Prism and on the Test Drive page. This is likely due to a problem with the download generation code, the tokenizer rules, or the language definition files. The inconsistency between the earlier and recent versions suggests a regression in the recent updates. To fix this issue, the build process and language definition files for "Shell session" should be reviewed and corrected to ensure proper tokenization and syntax highlighting.
