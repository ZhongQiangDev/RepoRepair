Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Numeric literals with underscores as separators (e.g., 1_000_000_000_000) are not being highlighted correctly as numbers in Prism.js
**Cause**: Prism.js's number token pattern in its syntax highlighting rules likely doesn't account for the newer JavaScript numeric separator syntax (underscores between digits), which was introduced in the TC39 proposal.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Decimal numbers with numeric separators (e.g., 1_019_436_871.42) are also not being properly recognized
**Cause**: The regular expression pattern used for matching floating-point numbers in Prism.js's JavaScript grammar doesn't include support for underscores as valid characters within the number format.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Prism.js not being updated to handle JavaScript's numeric separator feature. This affects both integer and decimal number highlighting. The syntax highlighting rules need to be modified to recognize underscores (_) as valid characters within numeric literals while maintaining proper number token identification. This is a language feature compatibility issue that requires updating Prism.js's JavaScript grammar definitions to match the latest ECMAScript specifications that include numeric separators.
