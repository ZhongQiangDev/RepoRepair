### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The numeric literals with underscores as separators are not being highlighted correctly.
**Cause**: The current version of Prism does not recognize the underscore (`_`) as a valid numeric separator in JavaScript. This is because the syntax highlighting rules for numeric literals in Prism have not been updated to include the new numeric separator feature introduced in JavaScript.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting of the numeric literals with underscores is inconsistent with the expected behavior shown in the screenshot.
**Cause**: The screenshot illustrates the correct highlighting of numeric literals with underscores, indicating that the underscores should be treated as part of the number and not as a separate token. Prism's current implementation likely treats the underscores as a separate token, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting of the numeric literals with underscores does not match the improved readability intended by the numeric separator feature.
**Cause**: The numeric separator feature in JavaScript is designed to improve the readability of large numbers by allowing developers to group digits using underscores. Prism's current highlighting does not reflect this intention, as it fails to properly integrate the underscores into the numeric literal highlighting, thus not enhancing the readability of the code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Prism's syntax highlighting rules for numeric literals do not yet support the new numeric separator feature in JavaScript. This results in incorrect and inconsistent highlighting of numeric literals with underscores, failing to enhance the readability of the code as intended. Updating Prism's rules to recognize and properly highlight underscores as numeric separators would resolve these issues.
