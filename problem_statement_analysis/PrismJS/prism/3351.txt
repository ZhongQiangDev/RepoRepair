### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "UUID" keyword is not highlighted as a "class-name" token but is rendered as plain text.
**Cause**: The Prism.js library used for syntax highlighting might not have the correct grammar rules defined for the "UUID" keyword in the Java language definition. This could be due to an outdated or incomplete language definition file for Java in the version of Prism.js being used.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting issue persists even in the latest version of Prism.js.
**Cause**: The issue might be a known bug in the Prism.js library that has not been addressed yet. It could also be that the Java language definition in Prism.js does not include "UUID" as a recognized class name, which needs to be updated in the library's source code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting works correctly on GitHub but not on the HackerTalk website.
**Cause**: The HackerTalk website might be using a different version or configuration of Prism.js compared to GitHub. GitHub might have custom language definitions or patches applied to Prism.js that include the correct highlighting for "UUID".

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the "UUID" keyword is not being highlighted correctly as a "class-name" token. This is likely due to an incomplete or outdated Java language definition in the Prism.js library. The problem persists in the latest version of Prism.js, indicating it might be a known issue that needs to be addressed in the library. Additionally, the difference in highlighting between GitHub and HackerTalk suggests that the website might be using a different configuration or version of Prism.js. To resolve this, the Java language definition in Prism.js should be updated to include "UUID" as a recognized class name, or a custom language definition should be applied on the HackerTalk website.
