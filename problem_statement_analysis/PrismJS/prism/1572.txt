### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current Prism implementation does not recognize the `gcode` language identifier.
**Cause**: The existing implementation is defined under the `reprap_gcode` identifier instead of `gcode`. This mismatch prevents Prism from applying the correct syntax highlighting when the `gcode` identifier is used.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting does not properly distinguish between comments and other elements.
**Cause**: The regular expression for comments (`/;.*/`) may not be correctly implemented or recognized by Prism, leading to improper highlighting of comments in the G-code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting of keywords (G and M codes) and properties (X, Y, Z, etc.) may not be accurate.
**Cause**: The regular expressions used for keywords and properties might not cover all possible variations or might be too restrictive, leading to incomplete or incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The existing implementation may not be integrated into the main Prism library.
**Cause**: The implementation exists in a separate repository (https://github.com/kmoser77/prismjs-reprap-gcode) and may not be included in the main Prism distribution, requiring manual integration.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the mismatch in language identifiers, potential problems with comment recognition, possible inaccuracies in keyword and property highlighting, and the need for integration into the main Prism library. Addressing these issues will ensure proper G-code syntax highlighting in Prism.
