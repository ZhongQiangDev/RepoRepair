### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Quotes inside HTML attribute values are highlighted as punctuation.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting library (Prism) is interpreting the quotes within the attribute value as punctuation rather than as part of the string. This is likely due to the way Prism's HTML grammar is defined, where it treats quotes as punctuation unless they are part of a string literal.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting does not accurately reflect the structure of the HTML attribute value.
**Cause**: The HTML attribute value contains a JSON-like structure with nested quotes. Prism may not be properly configured to handle nested quotes within attribute values, leading to incorrect highlighting. This could be due to limitations in the HTML grammar or the lack of specific rules for handling JSON-like structures within attributes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Prism is incorrectly highlighting quotes within HTML attribute values as punctuation. This is caused by the way Prism's HTML grammar is defined and its handling of nested quotes within attribute values. To fix this, the HTML grammar in Prism may need to be updated to properly recognize and handle quotes within attribute values, especially when they are part of a JSON-like structure. This could involve adding specific rules for handling nested quotes or adjusting the existing rules to better accommodate such cases.
