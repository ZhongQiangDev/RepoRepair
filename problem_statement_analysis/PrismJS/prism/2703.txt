Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The F# syntax highlighter incorrectly treats `(*)` operator as the start of a multi-line comment
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is misinterpreting the multiplication operator `(*)` when used as a function because in F#, `(*` and `*)` are traditionally used to denote multi-line comments. The highlighter's pattern matching is too aggressive and doesn't properly distinguish between the comment syntax and the legitimate use of `(*)` as a function.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Code readability is compromised due to incorrect syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The PrismJS syntax highlighting engine (used in the test drive) appears to prioritize the multi-line comment rule over operator recognition. This causes portions of valid code to appear as comments, making the code harder to read and understand.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting issue specifically affects idiomatic F# code patterns
**Cause**: F# allows operators to be used as functions through partial application (a common functional programming pattern), but the syntax highlighter's rules don't account for this language feature. This creates a conflict between proper language usage and syntax highlighting rules.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a conflict between F#'s syntax rules and the PrismJS syntax highlighter's implementation. The highlighter incorrectly interprets the multiplication operator `(*)` when used as a function, mistaking it for a multi-line comment delimiter. This creates both visual and practical problems for code readability, particularly affecting idiomatic F# code patterns. The syntax highlighter needs to be updated to properly distinguish between multi-line comments `(*...*)` and the multiplication operator `(*)` when used as a function.
