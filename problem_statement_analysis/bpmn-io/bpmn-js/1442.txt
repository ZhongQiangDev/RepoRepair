Based on the provided GitHub issue and GIF demonstration, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When multiple shapes are pasted onto a sequence flow, they are connected in an incorrect sequential order
**Cause**: The DropOnFlowBehavior.js doesn't properly handle multiple shape insertions simultaneously. It appears to process each shape independently without considering their relative positions or original sequence.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The connection lines between pasted elements are not properly distributed
**Cause**: The flow-splitting logic is designed for single element insertion but doesn't account for multiple elements being inserted at once, resulting in awkward or incorrect connection patterns.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The spacing between pasted elements is inconsistent
**Cause**: The automatic layout algorithm doesn't properly calculate spacing when handling multiple elements pasted at once, leading to poor visual organization of the workflow.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The original sequence flow is not properly maintained or considered when inserting multiple elements
**Cause**: The current implementation of DropOnFlowBehavior.js likely focuses on single-element scenarios and lacks logic for preserving the original sequence flow when handling multiple elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the BPMN.js library's DropOnFlowBehavior.js not being designed to handle multiple shape insertions onto a sequence flow. This results in four main problems: incorrect sequential ordering, improper connection distribution, inconsistent element spacing, and failure to maintain the original sequence flow. The behavior needs to be enhanced to properly handle multiple shape insertions while maintaining logical flow and visual consistency. This would likely require modifications to both the element insertion logic and the automatic layout algorithms.
