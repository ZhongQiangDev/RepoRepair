Based on the provided GitHub problem description and GIF demonstration, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Labels inside the subprocess remain visible after collapsing the subprocess
**Cause**: The visibility state of the internal elements' labels is not properly handled during the subprocess collapse transition. The code likely fails to update the visibility property of these labels when the parent subprocess changes its state from expanded to collapsed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The start event label moves significantly outside its expected position
**Cause**: There appears to be an issue with the label position calculation during the collapse transformation. The coordinate system or reference point for the label positioning might not be properly adjusted when the subprocess changes its state, causing the label to be displaced from its intended position.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only occurs during interactive collapse but not during import/export
**Cause**: This suggests an inconsistency in how the collapse behavior is implemented between different paths in the code:
1. The direct UI interaction path doesn't properly handle label visibility and positioning
2. The import/export path likely uses a different code path that correctly handles these properties

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around improper handling of label visibility and positioning during subprocess collapse interactions. While the core functionality works during import/export operations, the interactive UI path has bugs in:
1. Label visibility management
2. Label position calculations
3. State transition handling during collapse operations

These issues appear to be related to event handling and state management during direct user interactions rather than fundamental data model problems, as evidenced by the correct behavior during import/export operations. The fix would likely involve ensuring consistent behavior between all paths that handle subprocess collapse operations and proper management of label properties during state transitions.
