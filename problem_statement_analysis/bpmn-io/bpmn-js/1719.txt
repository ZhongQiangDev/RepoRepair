### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Labels inside the sub-process remain visible after collapsing the sub-process.
**Cause**: The software may not be properly handling the visibility settings for labels when transitioning from an expanded to a collapsed state. This could be due to a bug in the rendering logic that fails to hide the labels when the sub-process is collapsed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The label of the start event moves outside the sub-process boundary when collapsed.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the positioning algorithm for labels within the sub-process. When the sub-process is collapsed, the software may not correctly calculate the new position for the labels, causing them to appear outside the intended area.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are the visibility and positioning of labels within a sub-process when it is collapsed. The visibility issue suggests a problem with the software's rendering logic, while the positioning issue indicates a flaw in the label placement algorithm. Both problems need to be addressed to ensure that labels are correctly hidden and positioned when the sub-process is collapsed.
