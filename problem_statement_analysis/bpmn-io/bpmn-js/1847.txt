### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The append shortcut `a` does not trigger any action when used on elements where append actions are allowed in principle but not provided.
**Cause**: The software logic may not be correctly identifying the context where append actions are allowed but not explicitly provided. This could be due to a missing or incorrect condition check in the code that determines whether append actions should be available.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of defaulting to a create action when append is not applicable is not being observed.
**Cause**: The fallback mechanism for the `a` shortcut might not be properly implemented. The code responsible for handling the `a` shortcut might not have a proper fallback logic to switch to a create action when append actions are not available.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the software's inability to correctly identify contexts where append actions should be available and the lack of a proper fallback mechanism to default to a create action. These issues likely stem from missing or incorrect condition checks and incomplete fallback logic in the code handling the `a` shortcut.  
Video 1: The video shows the expected behavior when appending an event sub-process, indicating that the append functionality works correctly in some contexts but fails in others where append actions are allowed but not explicitly provided.
