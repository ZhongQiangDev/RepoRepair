Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes based on the provided BPMN diagram issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lane layout deformation after removing a child lane
**Cause**: The layout engine in v5.x and v6.x appears to have a bug in recalculating lane dimensions and positions when a child lane is removed from the parent lane. This causes incorrect redistribution of space and misalignment of remaining lanes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to continue editing the diagram after lane removal
**Cause**: The deformation of the diagram structure likely corrupts the internal model representation, causing the editor to enter an inconsistent state where further modifications become impossible or unpredictable.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Regression in newer versions (v5.x, v6.x) compared to older versions (v3.0.1, v4.0.1)
**Cause**: Changes in the lane management and layout algorithm implementations between versions 4 and 5 introduced these bugs. The older versions (v3.0.1 and v4.0.1) handled lane removal correctly, suggesting that recent architectural changes or refactoring affected the lane management functionality.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent spacing between remaining lanes
**Cause**: The lane spacing calculation algorithm fails to properly redistribute the space after lane removal, leading to irregular gaps and misaligned boundaries between the remaining lanes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from problems in the lane management system introduced in newer versions (v5.x and v6.x) of the BPMN editor. When removing a child lane, multiple related problems occur: layout deformation, editing limitations, inconsistent spacing, and overall diagram corruption. These issues appear to be regressions from previous versions, suggesting that recent changes to the codebase have negatively impacted the lane management functionality. The root cause appears to be in the layout engine's inability to properly handle lane removal operations and recalculate positions and dimensions of the remaining elements.
