### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram becomes deformed after removing a child lane.
**Cause**: The layout algorithm in the newer versions (`v5.x`, `v6.x`) may not properly handle the removal of child lanes, leading to incorrect recalculations of lane sizes and positions. This could be due to a bug in the lane resizing or repositioning logic that fails to maintain the integrity of the diagram's structure.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Sometimes, the user cannot continue editing the diagram after the deformation.
**Cause**: The deformation might cause elements to overlap or be placed outside the visible area, making it difficult or impossible to interact with them. Additionally, the underlying data structure representing the diagram could become inconsistent, preventing further edits.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the deformation of the diagram after removing a child lane, which is likely caused by a bug in the layout algorithm of the newer library versions. This deformation can lead to a situation where the diagram becomes uneditable due to overlapping elements or inconsistent data structures. The problem does not occur in older versions (`v3.0.1`, `v4.0.1`), suggesting a regression in the newer versions. Addressing the layout algorithm and ensuring consistent data structure handling should resolve these issues.
