Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and images:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Warning message "unresolved reference <CategoryValue_01k5toe>" appears when re-importing a BPMN diagram that contains a group inside a collapsed sub-process
**Cause**: The BPMN export functionality is likely not properly handling the CategoryValue reference for groups when they are placed inside collapsed sub-processes. This suggests an issue with maintaining the relationship between the group element and its category value during the export-import cycle.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram may not render correctly after re-import
**Cause**: The unresolved CategoryValue reference affects the diagram's rendering, as indicated by the warning message "Diagram may not render correctly due to import warnings." This is likely because the group's visual properties cannot be properly restored without the correct category value reference.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue specifically occurs with groups inside collapsed sub-processes, while groups in the main process work fine
**Cause**: There appears to be a scope-related issue in how the BPMN exporter handles elements within collapsed sub-processes. The exporter might not be correctly maintaining the hierarchical relationship between the sub-process container and its internal group elements during the export process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around improper handling of group elements within collapsed sub-processes during BPMN export/import operations. The problem manifests in three main ways: unresolved CategoryValue references, potential rendering issues, and scope-specific problems with collapsed sub-processes. The root cause appears to be in the BPMN export logic, which fails to properly maintain the relationships between groups and their category values when these groups are nested within collapsed sub-processes. This suggests that the exporter needs to be modified to properly handle the hierarchical structure of elements and their references within collapsed sub-processes.
