### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Labels and Associations are not moved with the Connection after resizing the connected shape.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the way the layout algorithm handles the repositioning of labels and associations when the shape is resized. The algorithm may not be updating the positions of these elements in relation to the new shape dimensions, causing them to remain in their original positions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Connection does not adjust its waypoints correctly after the shape is resized.
**Cause**: The resizing of the shape may not trigger a proper recalculation of the waypoints for the Connection. This could be due to a lack of event listeners or a flaw in the logic that determines how waypoints should be updated when a connected shape changes size.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are that labels and associations are not moved with the Connection after resizing, and the Connection itself does not adjust its waypoints correctly. These problems are likely caused by flaws in the layout algorithm and the logic for updating waypoints. Addressing these issues will require improvements to the event handling and recalculation processes within the library.
