### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Typed start events can be pasted onto a subprocess, which is not allowed.
**Cause**: The paste functionality does not check if the target location is a subprocess before allowing the paste operation. This lack of validation allows the typed start event to be pasted onto a subprocess, violating the rule that typed start events should not be used within a subprocess.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-interrupting events can be copied out of an event subprocess and pasted onto a subprocess.
**Cause**: The copy and paste functionality does not enforce the BPMN rules that restrict the placement of non-interrupting events. This results in the ability to copy these events out of their intended context and paste them onto a subprocess, which is not compliant with BPMN standards.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: Both issues stem from a lack of proper validation and enforcement of BPMN rules within the copy and paste functionality. The system should implement checks to ensure that typed start events and non-interrupting events are only placed in valid locations according to BPMN standards. This would prevent the incorrect pasting of these elements onto subprocesses and maintain the integrity of the BPMN diagrams.
