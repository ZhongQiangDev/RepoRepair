Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Typed start events can be copied and pasted onto a subprocess, which violates BPMN modeling rules
**Cause**: The copy-paste validation logic in bpmn-js library doesn't properly check for illegal start event placements during paste operations. While direct creation of typed start events in subprocesses is prevented, the paste functionality bypasses these validation checks.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-interrupting events can be copied out of an event sub-process and pasted elsewhere
**Cause**: Similar to the first issue, the paste validation mechanism doesn't properly enforce BPMN modeling constraints for event types and their allowed contexts. The validation that should prevent non-interrupting events from being placed outside their valid context (event sub-process) is not being applied during paste operations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The modeling tool allows invalid BPMN configurations to be created through clipboard operations
**Cause**: The implementation appears to have separate validation paths for direct element creation versus clipboard operations. While direct creation properly enforces BPMN rules, the clipboard handling code path likely doesn't reuse the same validation logic, creating a consistency gap in rule enforcement.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete validation during clipboard operations in the bpmn-js library. While the library correctly prevents direct creation of invalid BPMN configurations (like typed start events in subprocesses), it fails to apply the same validation rules during paste operations. This creates multiple ways to bypass the intended modeling constraints, allowing users to create invalid BPMN diagrams through copy-paste actions. The solution would likely involve ensuring that all BPMN modeling rules are consistently enforced across all element creation paths, including clipboard operations.
