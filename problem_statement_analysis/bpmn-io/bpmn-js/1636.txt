### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When morphing a call activity to an expanded subprocess, it creates a tiny subprocess that looks like a task, lacking a start event.
**Cause**: The morphing behavior for call activities does not include the automatic addition of a start event, unlike the morphing behavior for tasks. This discrepancy in behavior leads to a confusing user experience where the subprocess appears similar to a task.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of including a start event when morphing from a task to an expanded subprocess is not replicated when morphing from a call activity.
**Cause**: The underlying logic or code responsible for morphing call activities to subprocesses does not account for the automatic inclusion of a start event. This could be due to a missing or incorrect implementation of the morphing rules for call activities compared to tasks.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inconsistency in morphing behavior between tasks and call activities when converting to an expanded subprocess. The cause lies in the lack of a start event being automatically added when morphing a call activity, which is expected behavior when morphing a task. Addressing this requires updating the morphing logic for call activities to match the behavior of tasks, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience.
