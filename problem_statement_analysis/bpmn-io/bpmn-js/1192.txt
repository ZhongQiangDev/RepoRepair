### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The boundary event cannot be copied.
**Cause**: The `element.copy` rule in the BPMN rules file is preventing the copying of boundary events. This rule is specifically designed to restrict certain operations on elements, and in this case, it is preventing the copying of boundary events.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The copied boundary event does not maintain its association with the original task.
**Cause**: When the boundary event is copied, the association with the original task is lost. This could be due to the way the copying mechanism is implemented, where it does not preserve the connections and associations of the boundary event with its parent task.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `element.copy` rule is preventing the copying of boundary events. Additionally, even if the copying is allowed, the copied boundary event loses its association with the original task. To fix these issues, the `element.copy` rule needs to be modified to allow copying of boundary events, and the copying mechanism needs to be updated to preserve the associations of the boundary event with its parent task.
