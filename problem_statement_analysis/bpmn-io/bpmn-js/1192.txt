Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to copy boundary events in the BPMN diagram editor
**Cause**: There is a restrictive rule in the `element.copy` implementation in BpmnRules.js that explicitly prevents the copying of boundary events, even though detaching them is now supported

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between detach and copy functionality
**Cause**: While the system has been updated to allow detaching of boundary events, the copying functionality wasn't updated accordingly, creating an inconsistent user experience where users can detach but not copy boundary events

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited workflow efficiency for users
**Cause**: The inability to copy boundary events forces users to recreate them manually, even when they need to create multiple similar boundary events, which reduces productivity and creates unnecessary extra steps

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from an outdated rule in the BPMN.js implementation that prevents copying of boundary events, despite the fact that detaching functionality has been implemented. This creates inconsistency in the user experience and reduces workflow efficiency. The problem can be resolved by updating the `element.copy` rule in BpmnRules.js to allow copying of boundary events, bringing it in line with the existing detach functionality. This would improve user experience and workflow efficiency by allowing users to copy existing boundary events rather than having to create new ones from scratch.
