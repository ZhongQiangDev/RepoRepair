### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The editor throws an `illegal invocation` exception when an element is deleted while direct editing is active.
**Cause**: The `element.updateLabel` action is being invoked during the `<execute>` or `<revert>` phase of the command stack, which is not allowed. This happens because the direct editing process is not properly terminated before the element is deleted, leading to a conflict in the command execution flow.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The editor crashes when an element is removed via the context pad while in direct editing mode.
**Cause**: The `updateLabel` function is still trying to execute on an element that has been deleted, causing a reference error. This indicates that the direct editing state is not being properly cleaned up or reset when the element is removed.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user experience is disrupted due to the editor crashing.
**Cause**: The lack of proper error handling and state management in the direct editing and element deletion processes. When the direct editing state is not correctly managed, it leads to unexpected behavior and crashes, negatively impacting the user experience.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the improper handling of the direct editing state when an element is deleted. The `element.updateLabel` action is incorrectly invoked during the command execution phase, leading to an `illegal invocation` exception. This is caused by the direct editing state not being properly terminated or reset when the element is removed. To resolve this, the direct editing state should be properly managed and cleaned up before the element deletion process is initiated. Additionally, implementing robust error handling mechanisms can help prevent crashes and improve the overall user experience.
