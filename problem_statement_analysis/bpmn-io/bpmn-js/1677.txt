Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided information, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Application crashes with "illegal invocation" error when deleting an element during direct editing
**Cause**: The command stack is attempting to execute an element.updateLabel action on an element that no longer exists in the diagram, creating a race condition between the deletion command and the label update command

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Direct editing context is not properly cleaned up when element is deleted
**Cause**: The direct editing module doesn't properly handle the case where the target element is removed while editing is active, leading to dangling references and subsequent errors

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Command stack execution order issue
**Cause**: The element deletion command is being processed before the label editing completion command can finish, causing the label update to fail as it tries to reference the now-deleted element

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing validation check for element existence
**Cause**: The label editing provider doesn't verify if the target element still exists in the diagram before attempting to update its label

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of concurrent operations - specifically element deletion during active direct editing. This manifests in multiple related problems: command stack execution conflicts, incomplete cleanup of the direct editing context, and missing validation checks. The main fix would likely involve:
1. Adding proper cleanup handlers for the direct editing context when elements are deleted
2. Implementing validation checks for element existence before label updates
3. Ensuring proper command stack execution order or adding safeguards against conflicting operations
4. Potentially implementing a cancellation mechanism for ongoing direct edits when element deletion is initiated

The solution would need to address both the timing/race condition issues and add proper error handling to prevent the application from crashing in such scenarios.
