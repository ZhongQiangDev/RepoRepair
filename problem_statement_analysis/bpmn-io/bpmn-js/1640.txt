### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Multi-instance properties are lost when changing from parallel to sequential multi-instance.
**Cause**: The software may not be properly saving or transferring the multi-instance properties when the type is changed. This could be due to a bug in the code that handles the transition between parallel and sequential multi-instance settings.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of retaining multi-instance properties is not met.
**Cause**: The underlying data structure or state management in the software might not be designed to preserve these properties during the transition. This could be due to a lack of proper event handling or state persistence mechanisms.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user interface does not provide any indication or warning that the multi-instance properties will be lost.
**Cause**: There might be a missing feature or a design flaw in the user interface that fails to notify the user about the potential loss of properties when changing the multi-instance type. This could be due to a lack of user experience consideration during the development process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are the loss of multi-instance properties during the transition between parallel and sequential multi-instance settings, the failure to retain expected behavior, and the lack of user interface feedback. These problems are likely caused by bugs in the code, inadequate state management, and missing user experience features. Addressing these issues will require fixing the underlying code, improving state management, and enhancing the user interface to provide better feedback to the user.
