### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The deep linking overlay for the subprocess is lost at the end of the animation.
**Cause**: The deep linking functionality may not be properly integrated with the multi-diagram plugin. The plugin might not be updating the deep linking state when navigating between subprocesses, causing the overlay to disappear.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The navigation between multiple processes and subprocesses inside the same BPMN is not seamless.
**Cause**: The multi-diagram plugin and the deep linking feature may have conflicting or overlapping functionalities. The plugin might not be aware of the deep linking state, or the deep linking feature might not be aware of the plugin's navigation logic, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the loss of the deep linking overlay and the lack of seamless navigation between processes and subprocesses. These problems are likely caused by a lack of proper integration between the multi-diagram plugin and the deep linking feature. The plugin may not be updating the deep linking state, and the deep linking feature may not be aware of the plugin's navigation logic. To resolve these issues, the plugin and the deep linking feature need to be better integrated, possibly by updating the plugin to work with the latest version of bpmn-js and Camunda Modeler.
