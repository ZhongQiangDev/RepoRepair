Based on the provided GitHub problem description and the GIF demonstration, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The deep linking overlay disappears when navigating between diagrams using the multi-diagram plugin
**Cause**: There appears to be a conflict between the deep linking functionality introduced in bpmn-js/Camunda Modeler 5.0 and the multi-diagram plugin's navigation system. The overlay management system likely doesn't persist when switching between different diagram contexts.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of integration between subprocess deep linking and multi-diagram navigation
**Cause**: The two features (deep linking and multi-diagram navigation) were developed independently without consideration for their interaction. The deep linking feature was implemented in the core bpmn-js while the multi-diagram functionality exists as a separate plugin, leading to compatibility issues.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: State management issues between different navigation methods
**Cause**: The state management for subprocess visualization appears to be handled differently between the core deep linking feature and the multi-diagram plugin. When switching between these different navigation methods, the state isn't properly maintained or synchronized.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent user experience when combining both navigation methods
**Cause**: The UI/UX implementations of both features weren't designed to work together, resulting in competing interaction patterns and visual indicators that don't complement each other.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the lack of integration between two independently developed features - the core deep linking functionality and the multi-diagram plugin. The problems manifest in four main areas: overlay persistence, feature integration, state management, and user experience consistency. These issues arise because the deep linking feature was implemented in the core bpmn-js while the multi-diagram functionality exists as a plugin, without proper consideration for their interaction. To resolve these issues, either the multi-diagram plugin needs to be updated to work with the new deep linking feature, or the functionality needs to be integrated into the core bpmn-js with proper consideration for both navigation methods.
