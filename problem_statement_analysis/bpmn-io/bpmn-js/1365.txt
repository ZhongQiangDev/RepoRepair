Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inability to set isCollection marker on data objects
**Cause**: The current implementation of the BPMN-JS library doesn't support the isCollection property for data objects, despite this being a part of the BPMN 2.0 specification.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing UI controls for isCollection toggle
**Cause**: The application lacks the necessary user interface elements to toggle the isCollection property, similar to what exists for multiple/ad-hoc modifiers on user tasks.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent implementation across different object types
**Cause**: The feature needs to be implemented across multiple object types (data objects, inputs, and outputs) but currently isn't available for any of them, creating inconsistency with the BPMN 2.0 specification.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing visual representation for collection marker
**Cause**: The system doesn't have the capability to display the three horizontal lines marker that indicates a collection, as shown in the specification image (Figure 10.53).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the incomplete implementation of the BPMN 2.0 specification regarding collection markers. The problems include:
1. Lack of basic isCollection property support
2. Missing UI elements for toggling the collection state
3. Inconsistent implementation across different object types
4. Absence of visual indicators for collection markers

These issues need to be addressed to fully comply with the BPMN 2.0 specification and provide users with the expected functionality for marking data objects, inputs, and outputs as collections.
