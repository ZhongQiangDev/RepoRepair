### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current BPMN modeling tool does not allow users to toggle the `isCollection` marker on a data object, input, or output.
**Cause**: The tool lacks the necessary feature implementation to enable users to set the `isCollection` property as specified in the BPMN 2.0 specification. This absence prevents users from accurately representing data objects that are collections within their BPMN diagrams.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user interface does not provide a visual indicator or toggle similar to the multiple/ad-hoc modifiers on user tasks for setting the `isCollection` property.
**Cause**: The design of the user interface has not been updated to include a visual representation or control for the `isCollection` marker. This omission makes it difficult for users to identify and modify data objects that should be collections, leading to potential misinterpretation of the BPMN diagram.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no clear documentation or guidance within the tool on how to set the `isCollection` property for data objects.
**Cause**: The absence of proper documentation or user guidance within the tool can lead to confusion and misuse of the BPMN modeling features. Users may not be aware of the `isCollection` property or how to properly implement it, resulting in incomplete or incorrect BPMN diagrams.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the lack of feature implementation for toggling the `isCollection` marker, the absence of a visual indicator or toggle in the user interface, and the lack of documentation or guidance on how to use this feature. Addressing these causes will enable users to accurately represent data objects as collections in their BPMN diagrams, ensuring compliance with the BPMN 2.0 specification and improving the clarity and usability of the modeling tool.
