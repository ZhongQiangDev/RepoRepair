### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Boundary Events are not converted to Intermediate Events when moved to the canvas in a batch operation.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the batch move operation does not include logic to check the type of the events being moved and convert Boundary Events to Intermediate Events when they are moved outside their host. This could be due to a missing event type check or conversion function in the batch move operation code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The batch move operation allows Boundary Events to be moved outside their host without any warning or restriction.
**Cause**: The validation logic for the batch move operation might not be properly implemented or enforced. This could be due to a lack of validation checks that ensure Boundary Events remain attached to their host or a failure to trigger an error or warning when such a condition is violated.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of either disallowing the operation or converting the events is not met.
**Cause**: The design of the batch move operation might not have considered the specific case of Boundary Events being moved outside their host. This could be due to an oversight in the design phase or a lack of comprehensive testing scenarios that cover this specific use case.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the lack of proper validation and conversion logic in the batch move operation for Boundary Events. The current implementation does not account for the specific behavior required when Boundary Events are moved outside their host. To address these issues, the batch move operation should include checks to either disallow the move or convert Boundary Events to Intermediate Events, along with appropriate user feedback mechanisms.
