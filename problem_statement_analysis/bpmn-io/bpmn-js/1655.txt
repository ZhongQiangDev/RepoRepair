### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: External labels are set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color when using `modeling.setColor` API.
**Cause**: The `setColor` function might be incorrectly configured or implemented for external labels. It could be applying the fill color instead of the stroke color due to a misinterpretation of the label type or a bug in the function's logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The color applied to the external label is too light, causing a UX concern.
**Cause**: The fill color applied to the external label might be a very light shade, which is not visually distinct. This could be due to the color value being incorrectly set or the color palette used for external labels not being optimized for visibility.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only occurs when the color is applied specifically to the label and not when applied to the target shape.
**Cause**: There might be a conditional check or logic in the `setColor` function that treats labels and shapes differently. This conditional logic could be flawed, leading to the incorrect application of color to external labels.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `setColor` function is not correctly applying the "stroke" color to external labels, instead applying the "fill" color. This is likely due to a misconfiguration or bug in the function's logic. Additionally, the light color applied to the external label causes a UX concern, which could be due to incorrect color values or an unoptimized color palette. The conditional logic in the function might also be flawed, leading to the issue occurring only when the color is applied specifically to the label. Addressing these causes should resolve the problem and improve the user experience.
