Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When elements connected by an association are moved out of a subprocess, the association remains parented to the subprocess instead of moving with the connected elements.

**Cause**: The parent reference of the association is not being updated when its source and target elements are moved to a new parent container. The association maintains its original parent reference to the subprocess even though its connected elements have been moved.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Deleting the subprocess causes the association to be deleted, even though the connected elements still exist outside the subprocess.

**Cause**: Due to the incorrect parent reference, the association is treated as a child element of the subprocess. When the subprocess is deleted, all its child elements are deleted as well, including the association that should have moved with its connected elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper parent reference management when moving connected elements in the diagram. When elements connected by an association are moved out of a subprocess, two related problems occur: 1) the association's parent reference isn't updated to match its connected elements' new container, and 2) this leads to unwanted deletion of the association when the original parent subprocess is removed. The solution would require implementing proper parent reference updates for associations when their connected elements are moved to ensure the association maintains the correct hierarchical relationship with its source and target elements.
