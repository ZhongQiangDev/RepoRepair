### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The association's parent remains the subprocess even after moving the source and target out of the subprocess.
**Cause**: The software does not automatically update the association's parent when the source and target are moved to a new parent. This results in the association still being linked to the original subprocess, leading to unexpected behavior when the subprocess is deleted.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Deleting the subprocess results in deleting the association as well.
**Cause**: Since the association's parent is not updated when the source and target are moved, the association remains a child of the subprocess. When the subprocess is deleted, all its children, including the association, are also deleted.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the software fails to update the association's parent when the source and target are moved to a new parent. This oversight causes the association to remain linked to the original subprocess, leading to its deletion when the subprocess is removed. To resolve this, the software should automatically update the association's parent to reflect the new parent of the source and target.
