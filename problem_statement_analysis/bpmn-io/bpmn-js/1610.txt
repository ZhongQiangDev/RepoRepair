### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The direct editing box remains open after switching planes.
**Cause**: The direct editing feature does not properly detect the plane switch event and fails to close the editing box when the element is no longer visible.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The direct editing box does not cancel when the element is no longer visible.
**Cause**: There might be a missing event listener or a bug in the event handling mechanism that fails to trigger the cancellation of direct editing when the element is moved out of the current plane.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the direct editing box remains open after switching planes, which is caused by the failure to detect the plane switch event and cancel the editing. This could be due to a missing event listener or a bug in the event handling mechanism. Addressing these causes will ensure that the direct editing box is properly closed when the element is no longer visible.
