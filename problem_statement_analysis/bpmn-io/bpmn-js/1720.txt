Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The wrench menu shows inconsistent/confusing options after converting a task to a call activity
**Cause**: The menu logic isn't properly filtering or organizing the available transformation options, showing additional entries (sub-process collapsed, sub-process expanded) that may not be fully supported in the UI

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The shape doesn't resize properly when transforming a Call Activity into a SubProcess
**Cause**: There appears to be a missing transformation handler or incorrect size calculation when converting between these BPMN element types, causing the SubProcess to retain the smaller task-like dimensions instead of adopting the proper expanded SubProcess size

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: After converting to an expanded sub process, the element becomes stuck with limited transformation options
**Cause**: The transformation logic appears to have a one-way implementation, lacking proper bidirectional conversion capabilities between different BPMN element types

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The "collapsed sub process" option appears in the menu despite not being fully supported in either desktop or web modeler
**Cause**: Insufficient feature flag handling or UI validation that should hide unsupported transformation options from the menu

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from several interconnected problems in the BPMN editor's transformation system:
1. Poor menu option management showing unsupported or confusing choices
2. Incorrect shape resizing during element transformation
3. One-way transformation logic that creates dead ends
4. Inclusion of unsupported features in the UI

The root cause appears to be incomplete implementation of the transformation system, particularly around SubProcess handling. This needs a comprehensive review of both the UI logic for showing transformation options and the underlying transformation handlers that manage element conversions and sizing.
