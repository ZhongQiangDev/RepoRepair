### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: After transforming a task into a call activity, the wrench menu shows additional entries for sub-process collapsed and sub-process expanded, which is confusing.
**Cause**: The wrench menu is not designed to dynamically update based on the current state of the element. When a task is transformed into a call activity, the menu should ideally only show options relevant to a call activity, rather than including options for sub-processes. This could be due to a lack of conditional logic in the menu rendering code that checks the current type of the element before displaying options.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: After transforming a call activity into an expanded sub-process, the element visually looks like a task, and the wrench menu only allows changing it into an event sub-process, preventing the user from reverting it back to a call activity.
**Cause**: The transformation logic from a call activity to an expanded sub-process might not be properly updating the internal state of the element. As a result, the visual representation and the menu options do not reflect the actual type of the element. This could be due to a bug in the transformation function that fails to set the correct properties or flags on the element, leading to a mismatch between the visual appearance and the available options.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from two main causes: 1) the wrench menu not dynamically updating based on the current element type, leading to confusing options being displayed, and 2) a potential bug in the transformation logic that fails to correctly update the internal state of the element when changing its type. Addressing these causes would involve improving the conditional logic for menu rendering and ensuring that the transformation functions properly update all relevant properties of the element.
