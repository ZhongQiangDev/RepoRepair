### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Direct editing is activated for the task element after pasting when the task is in the first position.
**Cause**: The code responsible for handling the paste operation might be inadvertently triggering the direct editing mode for the first element in the copied set. This could be due to a focus or selection mechanism that automatically activates editing for the first pasted element, especially if it is a task.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists even after the fix implemented in issue #1152, which aimed to select all elements after pasting.
**Cause**: The fix in issue #1152 may not have fully addressed the underlying mechanism that activates direct editing. There could be a specific condition or event listener that is still being triggered for the first task element, bypassing the intended selection behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that direct editing is activated for the first task element after pasting, which is not the expected behavior. This is likely due to a focus or selection mechanism that is inadvertently triggering editing for the first element. The fix in issue #1152 did not fully resolve the problem, suggesting that there may be additional conditions or event listeners that need to be addressed to prevent direct editing from being activated. The video demonstrates the sequence of events leading to the issue, showing that the first task element is highlighted and editing is activated immediately after pasting.
