### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Multi-instance properties are lost when changing from parallel to sequential multi-instance.
**Cause**: The software might not be properly saving or transferring the multi-instance properties when the type is changed. This could be due to a bug in the code that handles the transition between parallel and sequential multi-instance settings.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of retaining multi-instance properties is not met.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the data persistence mechanism in the software. When switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance, the software may not be correctly storing or retrieving the multi-instance properties, leading to their loss.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user interface does not provide a warning or confirmation message when changing multi-instance types.
**Cause**: The lack of a warning or confirmation message might lead users to inadvertently lose their multi-instance properties without realizing it. This could be due to a design oversight in the user interface, where the software does not prompt the user to confirm the change or warn them about potential data loss.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the loss of multi-instance properties when changing between parallel and sequential multi-instance, the failure to retain expected behavior, and the lack of a warning or confirmation message in the user interface. These issues are likely caused by bugs in the code handling the transition between multi-instance types, problems with data persistence, and design oversights in the user interface. Addressing these causes will help ensure that multi-instance properties are retained and users are properly informed when making changes.
