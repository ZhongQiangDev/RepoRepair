### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The application throws an error when attempting to morph a DataStoreReference to a DataObjectReference outside of a Pool.
**Cause**: The error occurs because the code attempts to access a property of an undefined object. Specifically, the `updateDiParent` function in `BpmnUpdater.js` tries to call the `get` method on an undefined object, which suggests that the parent or some related reference is not properly set when the morph operation is performed outside of a Pool.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The morph operation is allowed outside of a Pool, leading to an error.
**Cause**: The application does not enforce the BPMN rules that DataObjectReference should be inside a Pool. This lack of validation allows the user to perform an invalid operation, resulting in the error when the morph operation is executed.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message is not user-friendly and does not provide clear guidance on how to resolve the issue.
**Cause**: The error message is a generic JavaScript error that does not specify the exact cause or the steps to fix the problem. This is because the error handling in the application does not include specific error messages for this type of invalid operation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the lack of validation for BPMN rules, the attempt to access an undefined object during the morph operation, and the unhelpful error message. To fix these issues, the application should enforce BPMN rules to prevent invalid morph operations, ensure that all necessary references are set before performing the morph, and provide more informative error messages to guide users in resolving the issue.
