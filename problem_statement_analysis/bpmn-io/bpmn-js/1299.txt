### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Completing direct editing with an empty label resizes the label target to minimum bounds.
**Cause**: The issue is caused by a specific commit (e4e789bd3eecc47597d97d6c8f1e71b941dee066) in the bpmn-js library. This commit likely altered the behavior of how labels are handled during direct editing, causing them to resize to minimum bounds when the editing is completed with empty text.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Clicking on an event or gateway causes the shapes of the elements to change, become smaller, and sometimes disappear.
**Cause**: This behavior is likely due to a bug introduced in version 6.3.3 of the bpmn-js library. The issue may be related to how the library handles the selection and rendering of events and gateways. The problem does not occur when using the Lasso Tool, suggesting that the issue is specific to the click event handling for these elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: Two main issues have been identified: resizing of labels to minimum bounds after direct editing with empty text and changes in the shape and visibility of events and gateways upon clicking. The first issue is directly linked to a specific commit in the bpmn-js library, while the second issue appears to be a bug introduced in version 6.3.3, affecting the click event handling for events and gateways. Both issues need to be addressed by reviewing the relevant code changes and ensuring proper handling of label editing and element selection.
