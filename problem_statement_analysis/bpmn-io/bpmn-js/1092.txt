### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The connection between the two tasks does not snap to the center of the tasks as expected.
**Cause**: The introduction of connection previews and grid snapping may have altered the snapping mechanism, causing it to prioritize grid alignment over center-to-center alignment.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The interaction for connecting the tasks is not intuitive and may result in unexpected behavior.
**Cause**: The new behavior may have changed the way the connection previews are displayed, leading to confusion for users who are accustomed to the old behavior.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The connection between the two tasks is not as smooth as it was in the old behavior.
**Cause**: The new behavior may have introduced additional steps or requirements for connecting the tasks, making the process less efficient.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The introduction of connection previews and grid snapping has caused issues with center-to-center snapping, interaction, and smoothness when connecting tasks. These issues need to be addressed to ensure that the connection process is intuitive and efficient for users. Video 1 and Video 2 show the expected behavior of connecting tasks center-to-center, which is not currently working as intended.
