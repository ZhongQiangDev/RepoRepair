### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "default" attribute on the exclusive gateway is removed when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is added to the non-default flow.
**Cause**: The BPMN modeling tool might not be correctly handling the addition of intermediate events to flows that are part of an exclusive gateway with a default flow. This could be due to a bug in the tool's logic that fails to preserve the "default" attribute when modifying the gateway's outgoing flows.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The default flow remains visually rendered even after the "default" attribute is removed.
**Cause**: The tool's rendering logic may not be synchronized with the underlying BPMN XML model. When the "default" attribute is removed, the visual representation should ideally update to reflect this change, but it does not. This could be due to a mismatch between the model and the view in the tool's implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue occurs with other types of catch events as well.
**Cause**: The underlying cause may be a general issue with how the tool handles the addition of intermediate events to flows connected to exclusive gateways. The same bug that affects Timer Intermediate Catch Events might also affect other types of catch events, indicating a broader problem in the tool's event handling logic.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the BPMN modeling tool incorrectly removes the "default" attribute from exclusive gateways when intermediate events are added to non-default flows. This is likely due to a bug in the tool's logic for handling such modifications. Additionally, the tool's rendering logic does not update the visual representation to reflect the removal of the "default" attribute, leading to a mismatch between the model and the view. The problem appears to be generalizable to other types of catch events, suggesting a need for a comprehensive fix in the tool's event handling and rendering mechanisms.  
Video 1: The video demonstrates the issue by showing the addition of a Timer Intermediate Catch Event to a non-default flow, which results in the removal of the "default" attribute from the exclusive gateway. The video also shows that the default flow remains visually rendered despite the attribute being removed, highlighting the mismatch between the model and the view.
