Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "default" attribute is automatically removed from the exclusive gateway when adding a Timer Intermediate Catch Event to the non-default sequence flow.
**Cause**: There appears to be a bug in the event handling logic where adding an intermediate catch event triggers an unintended modification of the gateway's properties, specifically removing its default flow attribute.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: While the default flow visual representation remains rendered, the underlying XML/model data loses the default flow configuration.
**Cause**: The rendering engine and the data model are becoming out of sync. The UI continues to show the default flow marking, but the actual BPMN model data structure has lost this information.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is not limited to Timer Intermediate Catch Events but affects other types of catch events as well.
**Cause**: The problem likely stems from a fundamental issue in the event handling code that manages gateway properties, suggesting a broader architectural issue in how the library handles modifications to flows connected to exclusive gateways.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the library's handling of gateway attributes when adding intermediate events. The primary problem is that adding a Timer Intermediate Catch Event (or other catch events) incorrectly modifies the exclusive gateway's properties by removing the default flow attribute. This creates a disconnect between the visual representation and the underlying model data, where the UI shows one thing but the actual BPMN model contains different information. The issue appears to be systematic across different types of catch events, indicating a fundamental problem in the library's event handling and property management system.
