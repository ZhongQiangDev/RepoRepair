Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The system currently allows typed start events to be created inside non-event based sub-processes through morphing
**Cause**: The morphing functionality doesn't have proper validation checks to prevent users from converting regular start events into typed start events when they are inside a sub-process

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: When moving start events into sub-processes, the event type is retained, which violates BPMN rules
**Cause**: The drag-and-drop or movement functionality doesn't include logic to automatically drop/remove the event type when a typed start event is moved into a sub-process

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The modeling tool doesn't enforce BPMN specification rules regarding start events in sub-processes
**Cause**: Lack of implementation of BPMN validation rules that specify that only untyped start events are allowed in non-event based sub-processes

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the improper handling of start events in sub-processes, specifically:
1. The ability to morph regular start events into typed ones inside sub-processes when it shouldn't be allowed
2. The retention of event types when moving start events into sub-processes
3. Missing validation rules to enforce BPMN specifications

These issues need to be addressed by:
- Implementing validation checks during morphing operations
- Adding automatic event type removal when moving events into sub-processes
- Enforcing proper BPMN rules throughout the modeling tool

The solution requires both preventing invalid operations and automatically adjusting event types to maintain BPMN compliance.
