### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `waypoints` property is serialized as `[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]` instead of the expected coordinates.
**Cause**: The serialization process is not correctly converting the waypoints objects into their string representation. This could be due to a missing or incorrect implementation of the `toString` method for the waypoints objects, or an issue with the serialization logic that handles the conversion of waypoints to a string format.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `waypoints` property appears only when the connection has a middle segment.
**Cause**: The logic that determines when to include the `waypoints` property in the serialized XML might be flawed. It seems to be triggered only when the connection has a middle segment, which suggests that the condition for including waypoints is not properly defined or is overly specific to connections with middle segments.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The exported XML contains an illegal `waypoints` property.
**Cause**: The BPMN library version `v4.0.0-beta.1` might have a bug related to the serialization of sequence flows with waypoints. This version could have introduced changes or bugs that affect the proper serialization of waypoints, leading to the illegal property in the exported XML.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the incorrect serialization of waypoints, the conditional inclusion of waypoints based on connection segments, and potential bugs in the BPMN library version. The serialization process needs to be reviewed to ensure waypoints are correctly converted to their string representation, and the logic for including waypoints should be more robust. Additionally, testing with a different BPMN library version might help identify if the issue is specific to `v4.0.0-beta.1`.
