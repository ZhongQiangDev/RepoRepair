Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect serialization of waypoints in the sequence flow XML
**Cause**: When creating a new task from an existing one with a connection that has a middle segment, the waypoints are being serialized as "[object Object]" strings instead of proper XML coordinates. This indicates that the object-to-XML conversion is not handling the waypoint objects correctly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unnecessary waypoints property in sequence flow XML
**Cause**: The BPMN specification doesn't require waypoints to be stored in the sequence flow element directly. Instead, they should be handled by the diagram interchange format. The current implementation is incorrectly including waypoint data in the wrong place of the XML structure.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior when middle segments are present
**Cause**: The bug only manifests when the connection has a middle segment, suggesting that the waypoint handling code has a specific issue with more complex path configurations. The basic straight-line connections appear to work fine, but the serialization breaks when additional waypoints are introduced.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper serialization of waypoint data in the BPMN XML output. There are three main problems: (1) waypoint objects are being converted to strings incorrectly, resulting in "[object Object]" in the XML, (2) waypoint data is being stored in the wrong location within the XML structure, and (3) the serialization specifically fails when dealing with connections that have middle segments. The fix would likely involve:
- Implementing proper object serialization for waypoints
- Moving waypoint data to the correct location in the BPMN XML structure
- Ensuring consistent handling of both simple and complex connection paths
