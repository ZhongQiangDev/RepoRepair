### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The dimensions of the Sub Process change unexpectedly when it is turned into an Ad Hoc Sub Process after collapsing.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the way the software handles the resizing and layout of elements when transitioning between different types of Sub Processes. When the Sub Process is collapsed and then converted to an Ad Hoc Sub Process, the software may not correctly preserve the original dimensions, leading to unexpected resizing.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The child element inside the Sub Process does not maintain its relative position and size when the Sub Process is collapsed and then converted to an Ad Hoc Sub Process.
**Cause**: The software may not be correctly calculating and applying the transformations needed to maintain the relative positions and sizes of child elements during the transition. This could be due to a bug in the layout or transformation algorithms used by the software.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are unexpected changes in dimensions and the misplacement of child elements when a Sub Process is collapsed and then converted to an Ad Hoc Sub Process. These problems are likely caused by bugs in the software's handling of element transformations and layout calculations during the transition process. Fixing these issues would require addressing the underlying algorithms responsible for maintaining element dimensions and positions during such transitions.
