Based on the provided GitHub issue and GIF demonstration, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram suddenly jumps/shifts position when wrapping a process in a pool
**Cause**: The viewport positioning logic likely doesn't maintain the relative position of elements when the pool container is added. This could be due to:
1. Improper handling of coordinate systems during the transformation
2. Missing viewport position preservation during the wrapping operation

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of user's current view context
**Cause**: The diagram rendering engine appears to be recalculating positions without considering the user's current viewport state. This might be because:
1. The viewport state is not being preserved during the pool wrapping operation
2. The transformation matrix is being reset to default values instead of maintaining the existing view parameters

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Abrupt visual transition during pool wrapping
**Cause**: Lack of smooth transition animation during the transformation process. This occurs because:
1. The operation is happening instantaneously without any transition effects
2. The rendering update is not properly coordinated with the structural changes in the diagram

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around viewport management during diagram transformations. The problems stem from three key areas:
1. Improper position preservation during pool wrapping
2. Loss of viewport context during transformation
3. Abrupt visual updates without proper transitions

To fix these issues, the implementation would need to:
- Maintain viewport coordinates during transformations
- Preserve user's view context
- Add smooth transitions for better user experience
- Ensure proper coordinate system handling when adding pool containers
