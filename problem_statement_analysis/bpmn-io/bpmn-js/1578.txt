### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate Pool ID when copying a Pool.
**Cause**: The software does not generate a unique ID for the copied Pool, resulting in two Pools having the same ID. This is likely due to a flaw in the ID generation or copying mechanism within the software.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Error when importing the exported file.
**Cause**: The exported XML file contains duplicate Pool IDs, which violates the uniqueness constraint required by the BPMN standard. This causes the import process to fail as it cannot handle duplicate IDs.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of unique Pool IDs when copying a Pool, leading to duplicate IDs in the exported XML file. This results in an import error due to the violation of BPMN standards. To resolve this, the software needs to ensure that each Pool is assigned a unique ID during the copying process. Additionally, the import functionality should be robust enough to handle or notify users about such errors gracefully.
