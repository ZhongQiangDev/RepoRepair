### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The empty pool resizes vertically when the space tool is used on it.
**Cause**: The space tool is not correctly identifying the empty pool as a fixed-height shape. Instead, it treats it like a regular shape that can be resized, leading to the vertical resizing behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The resizing of the empty pool disrupts the visual distinction between empty pools and lanes/expanded pools.
**Cause**: The resizing logic in the space tool does not account for the specific properties of empty pools, such as their fixed height. This results in the empty pool losing its unique visual characteristic when resized.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the space tool does not recognize the fixed-height property of empty pools, causing them to be resized vertically. This disrupts the visual distinction between empty pools and other elements like lanes or expanded pools. To fix this, the space tool logic needs to be updated to handle empty pools differently, ensuring their fixed height is maintained. The video demonstrates the resizing behavior, highlighting the need for this adjustment in the tool's functionality.
