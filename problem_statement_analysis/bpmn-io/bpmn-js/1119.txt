Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIFs showing the working and broken interactions, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sequence flow is not properly placed in the correct participant/process after replacing a message flow
**Cause**: The parent-child relationship management is not properly handled during the flow replacement operation. When converting from message flow to sequence flow, the modeler fails to update the parent container reference for the new sequence flow.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The modeler crashes when the previous connection source is a Participant
**Cause**: There appears to be an unhandled edge case in the connection handling logic when the source of the connection is a Participant. This suggests the connection replacement logic doesn't properly validate or handle participant-level connections during the transformation from message flow to sequence flow.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual rendering issues after flow replacement
**Cause**: The rendering engine is not properly updating the visual representation of the diagram after the flow type change, likely due to incorrect or missing parent container references in the underlying BPMN model structure.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from improper parent-child relationship management during flow replacement operations in the BPMN modeler. The main problems are:
1. Incorrect parent container assignment for new sequence flows
2. Crash when handling participant-level connections
3. Visual rendering inconsistencies due to incorrect model structure

These issues appear to be regressions in the master branch compared to version 3.3.x, suggesting that recent changes to the connection handling logic have introduced these bugs. The fix would likely involve properly maintaining parent-child relationships during flow replacement operations and adding proper validation for participant-level connections.
