### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sequence flow is not being part of the second participant after replacing the message flow with a sequence flow.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the new sequence flow is not being correctly assigned to the appropriate target participant. This could be due to a bug in the logic that handles the replacement of message flows with sequence flows, specifically in how it determines the parent participant for the new connection.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The modeler crashes when the previous connection source is a Participant.
**Cause**: The crash is likely caused by an error in the modeler's handling of connections originating from a Participant. This could be due to a missing check or an incorrect assumption in the code that leads to an unhandled exception when attempting to replace the connection.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the incorrect assignment of the sequence flow to the appropriate participant and the modeler crashing when the connection source is a Participant. Both issues stem from problems in the logic that handles the replacement of message flows with sequence flows. The first issue is related to incorrect parent assignment, while the second is due to an unhandled exception when dealing with connections from a Participant. Addressing these issues will require fixing the logic for connection replacement and ensuring proper error handling in the modeler.
