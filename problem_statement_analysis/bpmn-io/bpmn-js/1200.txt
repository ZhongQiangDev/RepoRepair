### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "conditionExpression" is removed from the sequence flow when changing an intermediate event to a "Timer Intermediate Catch Event."

**Cause**: The BPMN modeling tool may not properly handle the transition between different types of intermediate events. When switching from a generic intermediate event to a specific type like "Timer Intermediate Catch Event," the tool might not preserve all attributes, including the "conditionExpression," leading to its removal.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The sequence flow loses its condition type after the event type change.

**Cause**: The tool's logic for updating event types might not be designed to maintain the condition type of the sequence flow. This could be due to a lack of proper validation or a bug in the event type change function, causing the condition type to be reset or ignored.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of retaining the "conditionExpression" is not met.

**Cause**: The underlying code responsible for managing event types and sequence flow attributes might not have the necessary logic to ensure that the "conditionExpression" is preserved during the transition. This could be a design oversight or an implementation error in the tool's codebase.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the BPMN modeling tool fails to preserve the "conditionExpression" when changing an intermediate event to a "Timer Intermediate Catch Event." This is likely due to a combination of inadequate handling of event type transitions, missing validation logic, and potential design or implementation errors in the tool's code. To resolve this, the tool's developers should ensure that all relevant attributes, including "conditionExpression," are properly maintained during event type changes. Additionally, thorough testing and validation of event transitions should be conducted to prevent similar issues in the future.
