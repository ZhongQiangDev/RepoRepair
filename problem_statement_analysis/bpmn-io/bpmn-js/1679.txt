### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The XML label does not update when toggling between Parallel and Sequential multi-instance loop characteristics.
**Cause**: There might be a bug in the library version 9.1.0 where the toggle action does not trigger the expected XML update. This could be due to an issue in the event handling or the XML generation logic within the library.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected XML labels `<bpmn:multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics />` or `<bpmn:multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics isSequential="true" />` are not being generated.
**Cause**: The library might not be correctly mapping the toggle action to the corresponding XML attributes. This could be due to a missing or incorrect implementation of the toggle functionality in the library's codebase.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are the lack of XML label updates when toggling between Parallel and Sequential multi-instance loop characteristics. This is likely due to a bug in the library version 9.1.0, specifically in the event handling and XML generation logic. The toggle action is not being correctly mapped to the expected XML attributes, resulting in no updates to the XML labels. To resolve these issues, the library's codebase should be reviewed and updated to ensure proper event handling and XML generation for the multi-instance loop characteristics toggle.
