### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Names of message elements on message flows are not rendered.
**Cause**: The current rendering logic in the BPMN diagramming tool does not include the functionality to display the names of message elements. This could be due to missing code that handles the rendering of message element names or a configuration issue that prevents the names from being displayed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Message flows can have labels, which may conflict with the rendering of message element names.
**Cause**: The existing rendering mechanism may not have a proper way to handle the placement of message element names when message flows already have labels. This could lead to overlapping text or other visual issues, making the diagram difficult to read.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram does not provide a clear visual distinction between message flows and their associated message elements.
**Cause**: The current design of the BPMN diagram may not adequately differentiate between message flows and their associated message elements. This lack of distinction can make it challenging for users to understand the relationships between different parts of the process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the BPMN diagramming tool does not render the names of message elements on message flows. This is likely due to missing rendering functionality and potential conflicts with existing message flow labels. Additionally, the diagram may lack clear visual distinctions between message flows and their associated message elements, further complicating the understanding of the process. Addressing these issues will require updating the rendering logic and ensuring proper placement of message element names while maintaining clarity in the diagram.
