Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue and BPMN diagram.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Message element names are not being rendered in the BPMN diagram
**Cause**: The rendering functionality for message element names is missing in the current implementation of the BPMN-JS library. This is evident from the message elements shown in the diagram (marked with envelope icons) that lack their descriptive names below them.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential overlap between message names and message flow labels
**Cause**: There's no proper handling mechanism to manage the positioning and display of both message names and message flow labels. This is referenced in the alternative consideration mentioning issue #447 for "better handling between message names and message flow labels."

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of visual clarity in message flow communication
**Cause**: Without message element names being displayed, it becomes difficult to understand the specific type or purpose of messages being exchanged between different participants in the process flow, reducing the diagram's readability and effectiveness as a communication tool.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around the incomplete implementation of message element naming in the BPMN-JS library. This manifests in three key problems:
1. Missing message element names in the visual representation
2. Potential conflicts between message names and flow labels
3. Reduced clarity in process communication

The root cause appears to be a technical limitation in the current implementation that needs to be addressed while considering the proper positioning and handling of both message names and flow labels. This enhancement would significantly improve the diagram's readability and usefulness in representing business processes.
