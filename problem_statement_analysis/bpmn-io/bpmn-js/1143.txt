### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The editor crashes when trying to add other elements after adding a group to an empty diagram.
**Cause**: The console throws errors related to `setTranslate` on `SVGTransform`, indicating that the provided float value is non-finite. This suggests that there is an issue with the coordinate calculations or transformations when adding elements after a group.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The editor gets stuck and does not allow further modeling.
**Cause**: The errors in the console prevent the editor from processing further actions. The `TypeError` and `unhandled error in event listener` messages indicate that the event handling mechanism is failing, likely due to incorrect or undefined values being passed during the transformation process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is related to the `setTranslate` function on `SVGTransform`, which fails due to non-finite float values. This causes the editor to crash and get stuck, preventing further modeling. The errors in the console point to problems with coordinate calculations and event handling, which need to be addressed to ensure the editor functions correctly after adding a group to an empty diagram.  
Video 1: The video shows the steps leading up to the error, confirming that the issue occurs specifically after adding a group and then attempting to add another element. The console errors align with the described behavior, indicating the root cause of the problem.
