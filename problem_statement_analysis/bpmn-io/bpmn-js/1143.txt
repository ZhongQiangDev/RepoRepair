Based on the provided GitHub problem description and images, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Editor crashes when attempting to add elements after adding a group to an empty diagram
**Cause**: The editor appears to have issues handling the initialization sequence when a group is added as the first element. This suggests there may be assumptions in the code that expect other BPMN elements to exist before a group can be added.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple console errors appear when trying to add a pool after the group
**Cause**: Based on the error screenshot, there seems to be an issue with the root element handling. The errors indicate that the editor is unable to properly manage the parent-child relationships between elements when a group exists without other primary BPMN elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Editor becomes unresponsive/stuck after attempting to add new elements
**Cause**: The cascade of errors from the invalid state (group without other elements) likely causes the editor's internal state management to fail, preventing it from properly handling new element additions or user interactions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be that the BPMN.io editor doesn't properly handle the case where a group is added to an empty diagram. Groups in BPMN are typically meant to be organizational elements that contain or group other elements, so adding them to an empty diagram creates an invalid state. This leads to three main problems: editor crashes, console errors related to root element handling, and the editor becoming unresponsive. The underlying cause seems to be missing validation or initialization logic for handling groups in empty diagrams. The editor should either prevent groups from being added to empty diagrams or properly handle this edge case.
