### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Group elements are not rendered on top of all other elements.
**Cause**: The z-index or layering properties of the group elements might be set incorrectly, causing them to be rendered behind other elements. This could be due to a CSS styling issue or a problem with the rendering logic in the code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Group borders are not hidden behind the new element when a new element is created on a group's border.
**Cause**: The rendering logic for group borders might not be properly handling the layering of elements when a new element is added. This could be due to a lack of conditional logic that checks the position of the new element relative to the group borders and adjusts the rendering order accordingly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to incorrect layering and rendering logic. The z-index or layering properties of the group elements need to be adjusted to ensure they are always rendered on top. Additionally, the rendering logic for group borders needs to be updated to properly handle the layering of elements when a new element is added on a group's border. These changes should resolve the problem of group elements not being rendered on top of all other elements.
