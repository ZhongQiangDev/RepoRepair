Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Group borders are appearing behind new elements when they should be displayed on top
**Cause**: Incorrect z-index handling in the rendering stack. The group element's z-index property is likely not being set correctly in relation to other elements, causing it to be rendered below newly created elements instead of above them.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual hierarchy is not maintained for grouped elements
**Cause**: The rendering order logic in the application isn't properly considering group containers as parent elements that should maintain visual precedence over child or adjacent elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent layering behavior between group borders and other elements
**Cause**: The application's DOM/SVG structure might not be properly organizing elements in the correct stacking context, or the group container might be missing proper stacking context properties.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of rendering layers and z-index stacking contexts. The group container element is not being treated with the correct visual hierarchy in the rendering pipeline, causing its borders to be rendered behind other elements instead of on top as expected. This appears to be a fundamental rendering order issue that needs to be addressed at the application's drawing/rendering level. The fix would likely involve:
1. Adjusting the z-index handling for group elements
2. Ensuring proper stacking context is established for group containers
3. Implementing correct rendering order logic that maintains group elements' visual precedence over other elements

The issue is related to and depends on other tickets (#343 and #959), suggesting it might be part of a larger rendering system overhaul or update.
