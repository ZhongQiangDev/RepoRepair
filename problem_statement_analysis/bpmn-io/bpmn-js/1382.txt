### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The DataObjectReference replace menu only contains the collection marker, making it feel empty and out of place.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the DataObjectReference replace menu is limited and does not include options for switching to a DataStoreReference. This limitation results in an underpopulated menu, which does not provide users with the necessary tools for managing their data references effectively.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users cannot switch between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference within the replace menu.
**Cause**: The existing functionality of the replace menu does not support the conversion between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference. This lack of flexibility restricts users from adapting their data references according to their needs, leading to a less user-friendly interface.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the underpopulated DataObjectReference replace menu and the inability to switch between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference. The causes of these issues stem from the current limitations in the implementation of the replace menu, which does not include the necessary options for switching data references. Addressing these causes by expanding the menu's functionality will enhance user experience and provide a more versatile tool for managing data references.
