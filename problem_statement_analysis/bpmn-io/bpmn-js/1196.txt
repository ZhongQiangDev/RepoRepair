### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Boundary Event is not attached to the copied task after copying the task with the Boundary Event.
**Cause**: The copying mechanism in the BPMN modeling tool might not be correctly handling the attachment relationship between the Boundary Event and the task. This could be due to a bug in the code that handles the copying of elements, where the attachment reference is not being properly duplicated.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The copied Boundary Event appears disconnected from the copied task.
**Cause**: The tool might not be updating the XML representation of the BPMN diagram correctly when copying the elements. Specifically, the `attachedToRef` attribute in the Boundary Event's XML might not be pointing to the correct ID of the copied task.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user interface does not visually indicate that the Boundary Event is attached to the copied task.
**Cause**: There could be an issue with the rendering logic of the BPMN modeling tool. The tool might not be refreshing the visual representation of the diagram correctly after the copy operation, leading to the Boundary Event appearing disconnected.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the copying mechanism not preserving the attachment relationship between the Boundary Event and the task, and the XML representation not being updated correctly. Additionally, there might be a rendering issue in the user interface. To fix these problems, the copying logic needs to be reviewed to ensure that attachment references are correctly duplicated, and the XML and visual rendering should be updated accordingly.
