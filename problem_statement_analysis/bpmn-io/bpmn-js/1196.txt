Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When copying a task with an attached boundary event, the boundary event is copied but loses its attachment to the copied task.
**Cause**: The copy functionality likely only duplicates the visual elements (task and boundary event) without preserving the relationship/connection information between them. This suggests that the attachment properties or references between the boundary event and its parent task are not being included in the copy operation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The copied boundary event appears as a standalone element rather than maintaining its position relative to the copied task.
**Cause**: The positioning logic for the copied boundary event is not considering its parent-child relationship with the task. The coordinate system or positioning mechanism is treating the boundary event as an independent element rather than maintaining its relative position to the copied task.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Manual reattachment is required after copying, which reduces user efficiency and creates extra work.
**Cause**: The copy operation is not implementing a complete deep copy of all object properties and relationships. It's performing a shallow copy that only duplicates the basic visual properties but fails to maintain the structural relationships between elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete copying logic that fails to maintain the parent-child relationship between a task and its boundary event during the copy operation. This manifests in three main ways: lost attachment properties, incorrect positioning, and the need for manual reattachment. To fix this, the copying mechanism needs to be enhanced to perform a deep copy that preserves all relationships and attachment properties between the task and its boundary events. This would ensure that when a task is copied, any attached boundary events maintain their proper attachment and positioning relative to the copied task.
