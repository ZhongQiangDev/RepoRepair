Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Message flow connector can only be attached to the pool header after removing a lane, whereas it previously could be connected anywhere on the pool boundary.
**Cause**: The pool's internal structure/coordinates system likely retains memory of the previous lane configuration, affecting the valid connection points for message flows even after the lane is removed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between initial pool state and post-lane-removal state
**Cause**: The pool's boundary handling mechanism doesn't properly reset to its original state after lane removal, suggesting a state management issue in the modeler's codebase.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited connection points for message flows after lane modification
**Cause**: The click detection/hit testing area for message flow connections appears to be improperly recalculated after lane removal, restricting valid connection points to only the pool header area.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper state management and boundary recalculation after lane modifications in the Camunda Modeler. When a lane is added and then removed, the pool doesn't fully reset to its original state, causing message flow connections to become restricted to the pool header instead of allowing connections anywhere along the pool boundary. This suggests that the modeler retains some residual lane-related properties that affect the connection point detection system, creating an inconsistent user experience between the initial and post-modification states of the pool.
