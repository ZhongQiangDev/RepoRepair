### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The message flow can only be connected to the header of the pool after adding and removing a lane, not inside the single lane of the pool.
**Cause**: The software might be retaining some internal state or configuration related to the pool's lane structure, even after the lane is removed. This retained state could be affecting the way the message flow is allowed to connect within the pool.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of connecting the message flow directly inside the single lane of the pool is not met.
**Cause**: There could be a bug in the Camunda Modeler's lane management system that does not properly reset the pool's internal structure after a lane is removed. This could lead to the software incorrectly interpreting the pool's layout, preventing connections inside the lane.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The inconsistency in behavior between pools with and without lanes.
**Cause**: The software might have different logic or rules for handling message flows in pools with multiple lanes versus pools with a single lane. When a lane is added and then removed, the software might not switch back to the single-lane logic, causing the unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue appears to be related to the software's handling of pool lane structures. The Camunda Modeler retains some state or configuration related to the pool's lanes, even after they are removed, which affects the ability to connect message flows. This could be due to a bug in the lane management system or inconsistent logic between single and multi-lane pools. Addressing this issue would likely involve ensuring that the software properly resets the pool's internal structure and logic after lanes are added and removed.  
Video 1: The video demonstrates the issue where the message flow can only be connected to the header of the pool after adding and removing a lane, not inside the single lane of the pool. This confirms the described behavior and supports the identified causes.
