Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided images, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pool/lane labels are incorrectly oriented in vertical pools, making them difficult to read
**Cause**: The rendering logic doesn't account for the pool's orientation (isHorizontal="false" property) when displaying labels, causing them to maintain horizontal orientation even when the pool is vertical

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual representation of vertical pools is not properly implemented
**Cause**: The system doesn't fully support the `isHorizontal="false"` property specified in the BPMN DI (Diagram Interchange) XML, leading to incorrect rendering of vertical pool structures

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout and spacing of elements within vertical pools may not be optimized
**Cause**: The layout algorithms and spacing calculations are likely designed primarily for horizontal pools, without proper adjustments for vertical orientation

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Modeling support for vertical pools is incomplete
**Cause**: As mentioned in the linked issue (#507), the modeling capabilities need to be enhanced to properly handle vertical pool creation, modification, and interaction

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around incomplete support for vertical pools in both rendering and modeling aspects. The problems stem from:
1. Lack of proper label orientation handling for vertical pools
2. Insufficient implementation of the `isHorizontal="false"` property
3. Layout algorithms not optimized for vertical orientation
4. Incomplete modeling support for vertical pool operations

These issues need to be addressed both at the rendering level (for proper display) and the modeling level (for proper creation and manipulation of vertical pools) to fully support this BPMN feature.
