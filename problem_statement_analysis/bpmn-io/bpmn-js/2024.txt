### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pool labels are not correctly rendered in a vertical orientation.
**Cause**: The rendering logic does not account for the `isHorizontal="false"` property in the BPMNShape element's DI. As a result, the labels are displayed horizontally instead of vertically, which is the intended orientation for vertical pools.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout of the pool and its lanes does not align with the expected vertical orientation.
**Cause**: The current modeling support does not properly handle the vertical direction of pools. This leads to the pool and its lanes being laid out horizontally, which is not consistent with the specified vertical orientation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The bounds and positioning of the pool and its labels do not match the expected vertical layout.
**Cause**: The bounds and positioning values in the BPMNShape element's DI are calculated based on a horizontal layout. When the pool is marked as vertical, these values need to be recalculated to ensure proper vertical alignment and spacing.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the lack of proper support for vertical pools in both the rendering and modeling aspects of the BPMN diagram. The rendering logic fails to interpret the `isHorizontal="false"` property, leading to incorrect label orientation. Additionally, the modeling support does not handle the vertical direction, resulting in improper layout and positioning of the pool and its lanes. Addressing these issues requires updates to both the rendering logic and the modeling support to correctly handle vertical pools.
