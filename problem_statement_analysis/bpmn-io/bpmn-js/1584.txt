Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent process ID behavior during redo operation when adding the first participant
**Cause**: The undo/redo stack implementation likely doesn't properly preserve the process ID state. When performing a redo operation, it's creating a new process instance instead of restoring the exact previous state, resulting in a different process ID being generated.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent process ID behavior when deleting the last participant manually
**Cause**: The ID management logic treats manual deletion differently from undo operations. While adding a first participant preserves the process ID, manual deletion of the last participant triggers a new ID generation, indicating inconsistent handling of process ID persistence across different removal methods.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate process IDs when copying and pasting pools
**Cause**: The copy-paste functionality isn't implementing proper ID generation for cloned elements. Instead of generating new unique IDs for the copied pool and its process, it's maintaining the same ID from the source pool, resulting in duplicate process IDs in the XML output (Process_17iojvx appears twice).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from three main problems in the codebase:
1. Inconsistent state management in the undo/redo system that fails to properly preserve process IDs
2. Different ID handling logic between manual deletion and undo operations for participants
3. Inadequate ID generation mechanism in the copy-paste functionality that doesn't ensure uniqueness

These problems suggest that the codebase needs a unified approach to ID management across all operations (add, delete, undo/redo, copy/paste) and proper state preservation in the undo/redo stack. The implementation should ensure consistent behavior regardless of how elements are added or removed from the model.
