### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent redo behavior when recreating the first participant in the model.
**Cause**: The issue arises from the way the undo/redo mechanism handles the ID generation for the process element. When the first participant is added, the process ID remains unchanged. However, upon redoing the action, the system generates a new ID for the process, indicating a flaw in the state restoration logic. This could be due to the system not properly tracking the original state of the process ID during the undo operation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The process ID changes when the last participant is removed via delete.
**Cause**: The delete functionality does not preserve the original process ID, unlike the undo operation. This inconsistency suggests a difference in how the delete and undo operations manage the state of the process ID. The delete operation might be triggering a complete reinitialization of the process, leading to a new ID being generated.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate Pool ID when copying a Pool.
**Cause**: The copy functionality does not generate unique IDs for the copied Pool elements. When a Pool is copied and pasted, the system assigns the same ID to the new Pool, leading to a conflict during export and import. This is likely due to a missing mechanism that ensures unique IDs for newly created or copied elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues identified are related to the management of process and Pool IDs during undo/redo and copy operations. The root causes include flaws in the state restoration logic for undo/redo, differences in how delete and undo operations handle process IDs, and a lack of unique ID generation for copied Pool elements. Addressing these issues will require improvements in the state tracking and ID management mechanisms within the system.
