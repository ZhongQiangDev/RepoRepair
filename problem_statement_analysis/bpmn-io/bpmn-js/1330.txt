### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: It is possible to connect a message flow to a boundary event, which should be disallowed according to BPMN semantics.
**Cause**: The BPMN modeling tool does not enforce the BPMN specification rules that prohibit connecting message flows to boundary events. This could be due to a lack of validation rules in the tool's implementation or an oversight in the design of the tool's connection logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The connection between participant `B` and the boundary event is not being disallowed as expected.
**Cause**: The tool's validation mechanism may not be correctly identifying boundary events as invalid targets for message flows. This could be due to an issue in the tool's event detection logic or a misconfiguration in the rules that govern valid connections.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the BPMN modeling tool does not enforce the BPMN specification rules that prohibit connecting message flows to boundary events. This could be due to a lack of validation rules or an issue in the tool's event detection logic. To resolve this, the tool's validation mechanism needs to be updated to correctly identify boundary events as invalid targets for message flows and enforce the BPMN specification rules. The videos provided illustrate the steps taken to attempt the connection and the expected behavior of the tool.
