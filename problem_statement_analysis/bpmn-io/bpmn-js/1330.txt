Let me analyze the BPMN modeling issue described:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Message flows can be connected to untyped boundary events, which violates BPMN semantics
**Cause**: The validation rules in bpmn-js are not properly enforcing the restriction that boundary events cannot be message flow targets, specifically for untyped boundary events. While the validation works for typed boundary events, it fails to catch this case for untyped ones.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent validation behavior between typed and untyped boundary events
**Cause**: The current implementation has different validation logic for typed versus untyped boundary events, leading to inconsistent behavior. The validation rules should be applied uniformly regardless of whether the boundary event has a specific type assigned.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: UI allows attempting invalid connections that should be prevented
**Cause**: The modeling tool's UI does not proactively prevent users from attempting to create invalid connections to boundary events. Instead of waiting to validate after a connection attempt, the UI should indicate upfront that such connections are not valid targets.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete validation rules in bpmn-js that don't properly enforce BPMN semantics regarding message flows and boundary events. There are three main problems:
1. Untyped boundary events incorrectly allow message flow connections
2. Inconsistent validation between typed and untyped boundary events
3. User interface doesn't prevent invalid connection attempts

To fix these issues, the validation rules need to be updated to uniformly prevent message flows to all boundary events (both typed and untyped), and the UI should be enhanced to clearly indicate invalid connection targets before users attempt to create them.
