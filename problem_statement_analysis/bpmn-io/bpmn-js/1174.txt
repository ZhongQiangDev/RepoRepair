### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The connection layout is incorrect when reconnecting the start and end to form a loop in `bpmn-js@<=3`.
**Cause**: The algorithm used for laying out connections in `bpmn-js@<=3` does not properly handle the case where the start and end of a connection are reconnected to form a loop. This results in the connection being laid out in an unexpected and incorrect manner.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The connection layout is also incorrect when reconnecting the start and end to form a loop in `bpmn-js@4.0.0-beta.11`.
**Cause**: Similar to the issue in `bpmn-js@<=3`, the algorithm used for laying out connections in `bpmn-js@4.0.0-beta.11` does not handle the case of reconnecting the start and end to form a loop correctly. However, the specific way the connection is laid out is different, indicating that the underlying issue may have been partially addressed but not fully resolved.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: Both `bpmn-js@<=3` and `bpmn-js@4.0.0-beta.11` exhibit incorrect connection layout behavior when reconnecting the start and end to form a loop. The underlying cause is likely related to the connection layout algorithm not properly handling this specific case. The issue persists across different versions of the library, indicating that a more comprehensive solution is needed to address the root cause. Video 1 and Video 2 demonstrate the incorrect layout behavior when reconnecting the start and end to form a loop.
