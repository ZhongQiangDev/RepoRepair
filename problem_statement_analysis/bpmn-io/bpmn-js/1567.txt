Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided information, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Error thrown when trying to drill out (navigate back) from a sub-process after wrapping it with a pool
**Cause**: The Canvas component is unable to find the root element after the process hierarchy changes. This is evidenced by the error message "rootElement required" in Canvas.js, suggesting that the reference to the root element is lost during the navigation process.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Drilldown overlay functionality breaks after root element changes
**Cause**: The drilldown mechanism is not properly handling the root element updates when the process structure changes (specifically when a pool is added). This is indicated by the error occurring in DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js, suggesting that the breadcrumb navigation system loses track of the hierarchy.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Navigation system fails to maintain proper state during hierarchy changes
**Cause**: The state management system isn't properly updating or maintaining references when the process structure is modified by adding a pool. This is shown by the inability to navigate back to the parent process after entering a sub-process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of root element references when the process hierarchy is modified. The problem manifests in three main ways: canvas rendering errors, broken drilldown functionality, and failed navigation state management. The primary technical cause appears to be in how the Canvas component and DrilldownBreadcrumbs handle root element changes, particularly when pools are introduced to the process structure. This suggests that the implementation needs to be updated to properly maintain and update root element references throughout the component hierarchy when structural changes occur in the BPMN diagram.
