Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIF demonstration, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Labels disappear when extracting and pasting participant contents from a BPMN diagram
**Cause**: The copy/paste functionality in the diagram-js library has issues with label handling during the copy/paste operation, as referenced in the linked issue (diagram-js/issues/206). The labels are not properly included in the copied element collection.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists across all environments (browsers and operating systems)
**Cause**: This appears to be a core functionality issue in the library (bpmn-js v3.0.3) rather than an environment-specific bug. The problem lies in the fundamental implementation of the copy/paste mechanism for diagram elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The label loss occurs specifically during pool extraction
**Cause**: The participant contents extraction process doesn't properly maintain the relationships between elements and their associated labels during the copying process. This suggests there might be a disconnect in how the pool's child elements and their labels are handled in the element hierarchy during extraction.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the loss of labels during pool extraction and pasting operations in BPMN diagrams. This is a systematic problem in the bpmn-js library (v3.0.3) that affects all environments. The root cause appears to be in the copy/paste mechanism's handling of label relationships, particularly during pool extraction operations. The problem is linked to known issues with label handling in the diagram-js library. To fix this, the library needs to be updated to properly maintain and transfer label associations during copy/paste operations, especially when dealing with complex structures like pools and their contents.
