### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Labels are missing after pasting the copied contents into the diagram.
**Cause**: The issue arises from the way labels are handled during the copy/paste process. Specifically, the labels are not being correctly associated with the elements when they are pasted, leading to their disappearance. This is likely due to a bug in the label handling mechanism within the library.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The diagram does not retain the labels after the extraction process.
**Cause**: The library version `v3.0.3` may have a known issue with label retention during the extraction of participant contents. The quirky label handling mentioned in the additional context suggests that there might be a flaw in how the library manages the association between labels and elements during the copy/paste operation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that labels are not being retained when the participant contents are extracted and pasted into the diagram. This is caused by a flaw in the label handling mechanism within the library, specifically in the copy/paste process. The library version `v3.0.3` may have a known issue with label retention, which needs to be addressed to ensure that labels are correctly associated with elements during the extraction process. The failing test case on the feature branch can be used to reproduce and debug the behavior.
