### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `label` property still exists as `null` after removing the label of a Task.
**Cause**: The code responsible for removing the label does not properly delete the `label` property from the `di` object. Instead, it sets the `label` property to `null`, which causes issues with other tools that expect the property to be completely removed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The presence of the `label: null` property causes linting errors and issues with other tools.
**Cause**: The tools and linters being used are not designed to handle a `label` property with a `null` value. They expect the property to either have a valid value or not exist at all. This mismatch between the expected and actual behavior leads to errors and warnings.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `label` property is not being properly removed when the label is cleared, leading to the property existing with a `null` value. This causes problems with linting tools and other systems that expect the property to either have a valid value or not exist. To resolve this, the code responsible for clearing the label should be updated to completely remove the `label` property from the `di` object instead of setting it to `null`. Additionally, the tools and linters should be configured or updated to handle the `null` value if it is not feasible to change the code.
