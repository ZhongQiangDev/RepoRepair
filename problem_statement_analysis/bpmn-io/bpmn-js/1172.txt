Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and images.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The association (dotted line) between the boundary event and data object disappears after the BPMN diagram is exported and imported again.
**Cause**: There appears to be an issue in the serialization/deserialization process of the BPMN XML where the association information for boundary events is either not being properly saved during export or not being correctly parsed during import.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists across multiple versions (3, 4, 5) of the bpmn.io library
**Cause**: This suggests a fundamental issue in the core handling of boundary event associations rather than a version-specific bug. The problem likely lies in the base implementation of how boundary event associations are handled in the XML schema or rendering logic.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue affects all types of boundary events, not just signal boundary events
**Cause**: The root cause is likely in the general boundary event handling code rather than being specific to signal events. This indicates a broader architectural issue in how the library manages associations for attached elements (boundary events) in general.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is a persistence problem where associations connected to boundary events are not maintained through the export-import cycle. This appears to be a fundamental issue in the bpmn.io library's handling of boundary event associations, affecting all types of boundary events across multiple versions. The problem likely stems from either:
1. Incomplete serialization of association data in the export process
2. Incorrect parsing of boundary event associations during import
3. A potential architectural limitation in how boundary event associations are handled in the core library

The widespread nature of the issue (across versions and event types) suggests this needs to be addressed at the architectural level rather than as a simple bug fix.
