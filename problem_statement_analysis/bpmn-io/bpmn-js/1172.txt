### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Associations on `bpmn:BoundaryEvents` are not rendered correctly after the model is imported.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to how the associations are serialized or deserialized during the export and import process. The association information might not be properly saved in the BPMN file, or the rendering engine might not correctly interpret the association data when loading the file.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The association between the boundary event and the data object is lost after the model is reloaded.
**Cause**: There could be a problem with the BPMN modeler's handling of associations involving boundary events. The association might not be correctly linked to the boundary event in the model's internal data structure, leading to the loss of the association when the model is reloaded.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the associations on `bpmn:BoundaryEvents` are not being rendered correctly after the model is imported. This could be due to problems with the serialization/deserialization process or the modeler's handling of associations involving boundary events. To fix this issue, the BPMN modeler needs to ensure that the association information is correctly saved in the BPMN file and that the rendering engine can properly interpret the association data when loading the file. Additionally, the modeler should verify that the association is correctly linked to the boundary event in the model's internal data structure.
