### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The snapping functionality for docking points is missing in `v4-beta`.
**Cause**: The snapping mechanism that was present in `v3.x` has been altered or removed in `v4-beta`. This could be due to changes in the underlying codebase or a new implementation that hasn't fully accounted for the snapping feature.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The connected elements do not align properly when moved.
**Cause**: The alignment logic that ensures connected elements snap to their docking points may have been modified or is missing in the new version. This could be due to changes in the alignment algorithm or the way docking points are defined and recognized.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of snapping is not restored in `v4-beta`.
**Cause**: The update from `v3.x` to `v4-beta` might have introduced new features or changes that inadvertently broke the snapping functionality. This could be due to a lack of backward compatibility or insufficient testing of the snapping feature in the new version.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the loss of snapping functionality for docking points in `v4-beta`. This is likely due to changes in the codebase that have either removed or altered the snapping mechanism and alignment logic. To restore the expected behavior, the snapping feature needs to be re-implemented or the existing code needs to be modified to ensure backward compatibility. The provided videos illustrate the expected snapping behavior, which is currently missing in the new version.
