Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and GIF demonstration.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, all previously configured properties (Async Continuations and Job Configurations) are lost.
**Cause**: The copy-paste functionality likely doesn't properly handle the conversion between different event types (Intermediate to Boundary). The property transfer mechanism appears to break during this type transformation, suggesting the data mapping between these event types is not properly implemented.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The property preservation works for normal copy-paste operations but fails specifically for Boundary Event conversion.
**Cause**: There's likely a separate handling path for Boundary Event creation through paste operations that doesn't properly inherit or transfer the properties from the source Intermediate Event. This suggests an incomplete implementation of the property transfer logic specifically for the Boundary Event conversion case.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue affects all property fields consistently, not just specific ones.
**Cause**: The problem appears to be at the fundamental property transfer level rather than with specific property types, indicating a systemic issue in the event conversion logic when transitioning from Intermediate to Boundary events.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete property transfer implementation when converting between event types during paste operations. While normal copy-paste operations preserve properties, the specific case of converting an Intermediate Event to a Boundary Event fails to maintain configured properties. This suggests a gap in the property inheritance logic specifically for Boundary Event conversion scenarios. The issue affects all property fields systematically, indicating a fundamental problem in the event type conversion mechanism rather than issues with specific property types.

The fix would likely require implementing proper property transfer logic during the Intermediate-to-Boundary Event conversion process, ensuring all configured properties are preserved during the transformation.
