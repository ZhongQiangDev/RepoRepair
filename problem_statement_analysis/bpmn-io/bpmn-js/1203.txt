### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, it loses its properties such as Async Continuations and Job Configurations.
**Cause**: The software might not be correctly mapping the properties of the Intermediate Event to the Boundary Event during the copy-paste process. This could be due to a bug in the code that handles the conversion of event types, where the properties are not being transferred properly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The previously filled fields for Async Continuations and Job Configurations are not retained after pasting the Intermediate Event as a Boundary Event.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the data structure or the serialization process used when copying the event. The properties might not be serialized correctly, or the deserialization process when pasting as a Boundary Event might not be handling the properties appropriately.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is that the properties should be retained when pasting as a Boundary Event, but they are not.
**Cause**: The software might not have a mechanism in place to ensure that the properties of an Intermediate Event are compatible with a Boundary Event. This could be due to differences in the event types that are not being properly reconciled during the copy-paste process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the properties of an Intermediate Event are not being retained when it is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event. This could be due to a bug in the event conversion process, an issue with the serialization/deserialization of the properties, or a lack of compatibility between the event types. To fix this, the software needs to ensure that the properties are correctly mapped and retained during the copy-paste process.
