### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Box component throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')` when both `border="between"` and `gap="10px"` are specified.
**Cause**: This error suggests that there is an issue with how the `gap` property is being processed when `border="between"` is used. The code likely expects a specific format or type for the `gap` value, and when it encounters a pixel value, it fails to handle it correctly, leading to an attempt to read properties of an undefined value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Box component does not apply half the value of `gap` around the separator line as expected.
**Cause**: The implementation of the `border="between"` property might not be correctly accounting for pixel values in the `gap` property. It may be designed to work with relative units or predefined sizes, and when it encounters a pixel value, it fails to calculate the correct spacing around the separator line.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Box component breaks at runtime instead of gracefully handling the invalid combination of properties.
**Cause**: There is likely a lack of proper error handling or validation in the code. When the component encounters an unexpected value or combination of values, it should ideally provide a meaningful error message or fallback behavior instead of throwing a runtime error.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the handling of the `gap` property when used with `border="between"`. The component fails to correctly process pixel values, leading to a runtime error and unexpected behavior. The root causes include incorrect handling of pixel values, lack of proper validation, and inadequate error handling. Addressing these issues would involve improving the property processing logic, adding validation for the `gap` value, and implementing better error handling to ensure the component behaves as expected and provides useful feedback when invalid values are used.
