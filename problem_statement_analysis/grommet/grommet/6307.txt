### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sorting arrow icon in the table header does not update when using browser navigation (back/forward) even though the URL changes.
**Cause**: The component responsible for rendering the table headers and sorting arrows is not re-rendering or updating its state when the URL changes via browser navigation. This could be due to the lack of a listener or event handler that detects URL changes and updates the component's state accordingly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The URL reflects the correct sorting parameters (property and direction), but the table headers do not visually represent these parameters.
**Cause**: The logic that maps the URL parameters to the table header state might be missing or not functioning correctly. This could be due to an issue in the code where the URL parameters are not being parsed and applied to the table header state when the component is mounted or updated.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The table headers and sorting arrows do not reflect the sorting state when navigating back and forth in the browser.
**Cause**: The component might not be utilizing the `useEffect` hook or a similar mechanism to listen for changes in the URL and update the component's state. Without this, the component remains unaware of URL changes initiated by browser navigation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the table headers and sorting arrows do not update when the URL changes via browser navigation. This is likely due to the absence of a mechanism to detect URL changes and update the component's state accordingly. The component needs to listen for URL changes, parse the URL parameters, and update the table header state to reflect the current sorting parameters. Implementing a listener for URL changes and ensuring the component re-renders with the updated state should resolve the issue.
