### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The tab underlines (margin bottom) are not sticky to the bottom of the tab when there is scrollable content within the tab.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be related to the recent feature update in grommet (https://github.com/grommet/grommet/pull/6137). This update might have altered the CSS or layout properties of the tab component, causing the underlines to not stick to the bottom as expected. Specifically, the update could have introduced a new CSS rule or changed an existing one that affects the positioning of the underlines.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tab underlines are not aligned with the bottom of the tab content area.
**Cause**: The fixed height of the section containing the tabs might be causing the underlines to not align properly. If the height is fixed and the content is scrollable, the underlines might not adjust their position dynamically as the content scrolls. This could be due to a lack of proper CSS properties like `position: sticky` or `position: absolute` combined with `bottom: 0` to ensure the underlines remain at the bottom of the tab content area.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The tab underlines do not maintain their position relative to the tab content when scrolling.
**Cause**: The CSS properties applied to the tab underlines might not be responsive to the scroll event. If the underlines are not set to be sticky or fixed relative to the tab content area, they will not move with the content as it scrolls. This could be due to missing or incorrect CSS rules that handle the scroll behavior of the underlines.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the tab underlines are not sticking to the bottom of the tab content area when there is scrollable content. This is likely due to changes introduced in the recent grommet update, the fixed height of the section containing the tabs, and the lack of proper CSS properties to handle the scroll behavior of the underlines. To fix this, the CSS rules for the tab underlines need to be reviewed and updated to ensure they remain at the bottom of the tab content area, even when the content is scrollable. This might involve using properties like `position: sticky` or `position: absolute` combined with `bottom: 0` and ensuring the rules are responsive to scroll events.
