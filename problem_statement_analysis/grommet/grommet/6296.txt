### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The heading text overflows and collides with other content instead of wrapping when it runs out of space.
**Cause**: The CSS properties applied to the heading element in the PageHeader component do not include text wrapping or word breaking rules. This can be due to missing or incorrect CSS properties like `word-wrap`, `word-break`, or `white-space`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout does not adjust dynamically to accommodate the length of the heading text.
**Cause**: The layout container for the PageHeader component may have fixed dimensions or constraints that do not allow for flexible resizing. This can be due to the use of fixed width or height properties, or the absence of responsive design techniques like flexbox or grid.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The heading text does not break at appropriate points, causing it to overflow in an uncontrolled manner.
**Cause**: The text content may contain long strings without spaces or hyphens, which can prevent the browser from finding natural breaking points. This can be addressed by adding hyphens or using CSS properties like `hyphens` to enable automatic hyphenation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues causing the heading overflow in the PageHeader component are the lack of text wrapping and word breaking rules, fixed layout dimensions, and the absence of appropriate breaking points in the text content. To fix these issues, the CSS properties for the heading element should be updated to include text wrapping and word breaking rules, the layout container should be made more flexible using responsive design techniques, and hyphens or automatic hyphenation should be enabled for long strings without spaces.
