Let me analyze the GitHub issue description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Calendar layout is completely broken in IE11, with dates appearing in a vertical list instead of a proper grid layout
**Cause**: This is likely due to IE11's limited support for modern CSS Grid or Flexbox features that Grommet2 Calendar component uses for layout. IE11 requires specific prefixes and has partial implementation of these layout systems.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Calendar styling appears to be missing or incorrect, with no visible borders or proper spacing
**Cause**: IE11 may not be properly interpreting the CSS styling rules used in Grommet2. This could be due to:
- Missing IE11-specific CSS prefixes
- Usage of modern CSS properties not supported by IE11
- CSS fallbacks not being properly implemented for IE11

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Calendar dates are not properly aligned and formatted
**Cause**: The component might be using modern JavaScript/ECMAScript features that are not fully supported in IE11, causing the rendering logic to fail or behave unexpectedly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Grommet2 Calendar component's issues in IE11 stem from three main areas:
1. Layout system compatibility issues with IE11's limited CSS Grid/Flexbox support
2. CSS styling and property support problems specific to IE11
3. Potential JavaScript compatibility issues

To fix these issues, the component would need to:
- Implement proper IE11 fallbacks for modern CSS features
- Add appropriate vendor prefixes for IE11
- Ensure JavaScript code is transpiled correctly for IE11 compatibility
- Consider providing alternative layouts for legacy browsers like IE11
