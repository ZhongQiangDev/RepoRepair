### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The calendar is not displaying all the dates properly. Only a few dates are visible, and the layout appears to be broken.
**Cause**: This issue could be due to CSS compatibility problems with Internet Explorer 11. IE11 has limited support for modern CSS features, which might cause the calendar's layout to break. The CSS used in Grommet2 might include properties or selectors that are not fully supported by IE11.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The calendar's dropdown is not fully expanded, and the dates are not aligned correctly.
**Cause**: The problem might be related to JavaScript or CSS flexbox issues. IE11 has known issues with flexbox, which could cause the calendar's dropdown to not expand properly and the dates to be misaligned. Additionally, there might be JavaScript code that is not executing correctly in IE11, leading to the broken layout.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The calendar's navigation arrows (for switching months) are not visible or not functioning as expected.
**Cause**: This could be due to CSS visibility or display issues in IE11. The navigation arrows might be hidden or not rendered correctly due to unsupported CSS properties. Alternatively, there could be JavaScript code that is not compatible with IE11, preventing the navigation arrows from functioning.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues with the Grommet2 Calendar in IE11 are related to CSS and JavaScript compatibility. The calendar's layout is broken due to unsupported CSS properties, and the JavaScript code might not be executing correctly. To fix these issues, the CSS and JavaScript code should be reviewed and updated to ensure compatibility with IE11. This might involve using fallbacks for unsupported CSS properties and ensuring that the JavaScript code is compatible with IE11.
