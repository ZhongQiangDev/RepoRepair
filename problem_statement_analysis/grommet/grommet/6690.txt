Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Color contrast violation in Form/AggregateValidation component
**Cause**: The "status-error" color being used doesn't meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) contrast requirements for text readability against its background. Based on the screenshot, the red error text appears to have insufficient contrast ratio with its background color.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessibility standards non-compliance
**Cause**: The color value defined for the "status-error" property likely wasn't tested against accessibility standards during implementation, resulting in text that may be difficult to read for users with visual impairments.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent error state visualization
**Cause**: The current error state styling using "status-error" color doesn't properly balance both aesthetic design and accessibility requirements, leading to poor user experience for some users.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around accessibility compliance, specifically color contrast ratios. The "status-error" color property needs to be updated to meet WCAG guidelines while maintaining its error indication functionality. This requires:
1. Adjusting the color values to achieve proper contrast ratios
2. Testing the new colors against accessibility standards
3. Ensuring the error state remains visually distinct while being accessible to all users

The fix would involve selecting a new color value for "status-error" that maintains the error indication purpose while meeting the minimum contrast ratio requirements specified by WCAG guidelines (typically 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text).
