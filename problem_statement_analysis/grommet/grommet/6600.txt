### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Filters overflow in the dropdown menu, causing a cramped and cluttered appearance.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the `DataFilters` component only supports a `drop` prop, which confines the filters to a dropdown menu. This layout is not suitable for a large number of filters, leading to overflow and a poor user experience.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The filters are not displayed in a separate layer, which would provide more space and improve usability.
**Cause**: The `DataFilters` component lacks a `layer` prop that would allow the filters to be displayed in a separate layer. Without this prop, the filters are restricted to the dropdown menu, which is not optimal for a large number of filters.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current layout does not match the expected behavior shown in the provided image.
**Cause**: The design and implementation of the `DataFilters` component do not align with the intended design. The expected behavior includes a separate layer for filters, which is not currently supported by the component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the overflow of filters in the dropdown menu and the lack of a `layer` prop to display filters in a separate layer. These problems stem from the current implementation of the `DataFilters` component, which only supports a `drop` prop and does not provide the necessary layout flexibility for a large number of filters. To resolve these issues, the `DataFilters` component should be updated to include a `layer` prop, allowing filters to be displayed in a separate layer and improving the overall user experience.
