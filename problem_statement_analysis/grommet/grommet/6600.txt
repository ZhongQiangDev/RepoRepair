Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Filters overflow in the dropdown menu, making them difficult to view and interact with
**Cause**: The dropdown menu has limited vertical space and doesn't accommodate multiple filters properly, leading to content overflow issues

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of proper space management for displaying multiple filters
**Cause**: The current DataFilters component only supports a `drop` prop for dropdown menus, without an alternative layout option for handling many filters

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor user experience when dealing with multiple filters
**Cause**: Missing `layer` prop implementation that would allow filters to be displayed in a separate, more spacious overlay/modal view

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the DataFilters component's limited display options. Currently, it only supports a dropdown menu view through the `drop` prop, which becomes problematic when handling multiple filters. The dropdown menu's confined space causes overflow issues, making filters difficult to access and use. The solution proposed is to implement a new `layer` prop that would enable filters to be displayed in a separate overlay layer, providing more space and better organization for multiple filters. This would significantly improve the user experience when working with numerous filter options.
