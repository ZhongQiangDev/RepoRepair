### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The animation is not smooth when changing the value of the circle Meter.
**Cause**: The "transition all" of 300ms on the path of the SVG is causing the weird animation in Chrome. This transition is applied to all properties, which may cause unexpected behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no animation at all in the latest Firefox and Safari.
**Cause**: The "transition all" property may not be supported or may behave differently in these browsers, leading to the absence of animation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the use of "transition all" on the SVG path, which causes unexpected behavior in Chrome and may not be supported in other browsers. To fix this, consider specifying the exact properties to transition instead of using "transition all". This should ensure a smooth animation across all browsers.  
Video 1: The video shows a smooth animation of a circle meter, which is the expected behavior. The animation progresses smoothly from 44% to 61% and then to 33%, indicating that the issue described in the GitHub problem description is not present in this video.
