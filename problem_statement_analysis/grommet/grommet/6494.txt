### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The RangeInput extends beyond the edge of the FormField.
**Cause**: The CSS styles applied to the RangeInput or FormField may not be correctly constraining the RangeInput within the boundaries of the FormField. This could be due to incorrect padding, margin, or width settings.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The RangeInput is not centered within the FormField.
**Cause**: The alignment properties (such as `justify-content`, `align-items`, or `text-align`) may not be set correctly for the container or the RangeInput itself. Additionally, the RangeInput's internal layout properties might not be configured to center it within its parent container.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is visible in both grommet and hpe themes.
**Cause**: The problem might be related to the default styling provided by the Grommet library for the RangeInput and FormField components. The styles might not be theme-specific, leading to the same issue across different themes. Alternatively, there could be a missing or incorrect override in the theme configuration.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The RangeInput extends beyond the FormField and is not centered due to incorrect CSS styles and alignment properties. The issue persists across themes, suggesting a problem with the default styling or a missing override in the theme configuration. Addressing the padding, margin, width, and alignment properties should resolve the issue. Additionally, reviewing the theme-specific styles may help ensure consistent behavior across different themes.
