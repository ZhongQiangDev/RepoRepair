### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The chart does not render bars when data includes a negative value.
**Cause**: The `DataChart` component in Grommet version 2.4.0 may not be handling negative values correctly. It seems that the component is not designed to accommodate negative values, leading to the chart not rendering any bars when negative values are present in the data.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no zero line guide when negative values are included in the data.
**Cause**: The `DataChart` component does not automatically include a zero line guide when negative values are present. This could be due to a lack of configuration options or default settings that handle negative values and their visualization.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Custom attributes (colors) for negative values cannot be applied.
**Cause**: The `DataChart` component may not support custom styling for negative values. This could be due to limitations in the component's API or a lack of documentation on how to customize the appearance of negative values.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the `DataChart` component's inability to handle negative values properly. The component does not render bars for negative values, does not include a zero line guide, and does not allow for custom styling of negative values. These issues are likely due to limitations in the component's design and functionality in Grommet version 2.4.0. To resolve these issues, the component may need to be updated or replaced with a more robust charting library that supports negative values and customization options.
