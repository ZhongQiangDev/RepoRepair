### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `DataTableGroup` component is missing from the existing `Data` related components.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks a dedicated component to handle the `groupBy` functionality for `DataTable`, which is currently being managed using a `Select` component. This indicates a gap in the component library that could lead to inconsistent UI/UX across different applications using the `Data` components.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `Select` component used for `groupBy` functionality may not provide the best user experience.
**Cause**: The `Select` component, while functional, might not be the most intuitive or user-friendly way to handle grouping data. Users may find it less discoverable or less efficient compared to a dedicated `DataTableGroup` component that is specifically designed for this purpose.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation may lead to code duplication or inconsistency.
**Cause**: If multiple applications or parts of an application need to implement `groupBy` functionality, using a `Select` component might result in duplicated code or inconsistent implementations. A dedicated `DataTableGroup` component would provide a standardized solution that can be reused across different contexts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the absence of a `DataTableGroup` component in the existing `Data` related components. This absence leads to the use of a `Select` component for `groupBy` functionality, which may not provide the best user experience and can result in code duplication or inconsistency. Introducing a dedicated `DataTableGroup` component would address these issues by providing a standardized, user-friendly, and reusable solution for handling `groupBy` functionality in `DataTable`.
