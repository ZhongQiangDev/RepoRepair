Based on the GitHub problem description, this appears to be a feature request rather than a bug report. The user is suggesting that a `DataTableGroup` component should be added to complement the existing Data-related components. Let me analyze this situation:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of a dedicated component for handling table grouping functionality
**Cause**: The current implementation requires users to manually implement grouping using a basic Select component, which may lead to inconsistent implementations across different parts of the application

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential code duplication across projects
**Cause**: Without a standardized `DataTableGroup` component, developers need to write their own grouping implementation repeatedly, leading to maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent user experience
**Cause**: Different implementations of the grouping functionality could lead to varying user experiences across different parts of the application

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is not a bug but rather a missing feature in the component library. Currently, developers need to implement table grouping functionality manually using basic components like Select. This leads to three main problems: lack of a standardized grouping component, potential code duplication, and inconsistent user experience. Creating a dedicated `DataTableGroup` component would provide a standardized solution for handling table grouping, improve code reusability, and ensure consistent user experience across the application.

The screenshots provided show a current implementation using a Select component, which serves as a good reference for how the proposed `DataTableGroup` component could function.
