### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The search input in Safari is very small and does not respect the padding as intended.
**Cause**: Safari applies its own default styling to `<input type='search' />` elements, which includes a specific `-webkit-appearance` property that overrides custom padding and other styles. This default styling is not present in Chrome, which is why the input appears correctly there.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The search input in Safari does not match the appearance of the search input in Chrome.
**Cause**: The `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` CSS property, which was used in v1 to normalize the appearance of the search input across browsers, is missing in v2. This property is necessary to ensure that the search input in Safari behaves like a regular text input, allowing custom styles such as padding to be applied.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Safari applies its own default styling to `<input type='search' />` elements, which causes the search input to appear very small and ignore padding. This behavior is different from Chrome because Chrome does not apply the same default styling. To fix this, the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` CSS property should be added to the search input in v2, as it was in v1, to normalize the appearance and behavior across browsers. This will ensure that the search input in Safari matches the appearance and functionality of the search input in Chrome.
