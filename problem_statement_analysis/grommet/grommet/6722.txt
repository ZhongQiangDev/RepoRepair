### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Name (Text-Element) and the value (Select component) are not aligned vertically.
**Cause**: The `valueProps` property in the `NameValueList` component is set to `align: "start"`, which may not be the correct alignment for the desired layout. The `start` alignment might be causing the text to align at the top of the container, while the Select component might have a different default alignment.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Name (Text-Element) and the value (Select component) are not horizontally centered.
**Cause**: The `valueProps` property in the `NameValueList` component is set to `width: "auto"`, which might not be providing enough space for the Select component to align properly with the Name. Additionally, the Select component might have its own default styling that is not being overridden.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Name (Text-Element) and the value (Select component) are not aligned as expected.
**Cause**: The `NameValuePair` component might not be properly styled to align its children (the Name and the value) as desired. The default styling of the `NameValuePair` component might not be suitable for the specific layout requirements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the alignment and styling of the `NameValueList` and `NameValuePair` components. The `align: "start"` property in `valueProps` might be causing the vertical misalignment, while the `width: "auto"` property might be affecting the horizontal alignment. Additionally, the default styling of the `NameValuePair` component might need to be adjusted to achieve the desired layout. To solve these issues, you can try adjusting the alignment properties, overriding the default styling, or using custom CSS to achieve the desired alignment.
