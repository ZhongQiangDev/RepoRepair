### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The circle meter in `v2.25.0` only renders the last data point instead of all the data points.
**Cause**: There might be a regression in the rendering logic of the circle meter in `v2.25.0`. The code responsible for rendering the segments of the circle meter may have been altered or optimized in a way that only the last value is being rendered. This could be due to a bug in the loop or iteration logic that processes the `values` array.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The circle meter in `v2.25.0` does not display the expected segments for each data point.
**Cause**: The issue could be related to changes in the styling or positioning of the segments. The CSS or SVG rendering code might have been updated in `v2.25.0`, causing the segments to overlap or not be displayed correctly. This could be due to incorrect calculations of the arc lengths or angles for each segment.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The circle meter in `v2.25.0` does not match the expected behavior seen in `v2.24.0`.
**Cause**: There might be a change in the default props or configuration options for the circle meter in `v2.25.0`. The `size` and `thickness` props might be interpreted differently, leading to a different visual representation of the data points. This could be due to a change in the default values or a bug in how these props are applied.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is a regression in the rendering logic of the circle meter in `v2.25.0`, which causes only the last data point to be displayed. This could be due to a bug in the iteration logic, incorrect calculations of arc lengths or angles, or changes in the default props and configuration options. To resolve this, the rendering logic and styling calculations should be reviewed and corrected to ensure all data points are displayed as expected.
