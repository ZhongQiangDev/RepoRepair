### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The form remains invalid even after toggling the checkbox back, which removes the required `TextInput` field.
**Cause**: The form validation logic might not be properly updating the validation state when the `TextInput` field is dynamically removed. The validation state could be retaining the previous state where the `TextInput` was required and not filled.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The form validation status does not reflect the current state of the form fields accurately.
**Cause**: There might be a delay or issue in the re-rendering process of the form component. The form might not be re-rendering correctly after the checkbox state changes, leading to outdated validation results.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The form validation does not update correctly when the checkbox is toggled.
**Cause**: The validation logic might be tied to the initial form structure and does not dynamically adjust when fields are added or removed. This could be due to how the validation rules are set up or how the form state is managed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the form validation not updating correctly when fields are dynamically added or removed. This could be due to outdated validation states, re-rendering issues, or static validation rules. To resolve these issues, the validation logic should dynamically adjust based on the current form structure and ensure that the form state is properly updated when fields are added or removed. Additionally, ensuring that the form re-renders correctly after state changes can help in reflecting the accurate validation status.
