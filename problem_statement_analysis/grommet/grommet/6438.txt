Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Users can select dates from the previous month that are outside the specified calendar bounds
**Cause**: The DateInput component's date selection validation appears to be improperly handling the boundary dates, specifically at the beginning of the month. While the bounds are set to ['2020-07-01', '2020-07-31'], the component is still allowing selection of dates from June 2020.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Calendar view shows dates from previous month despite bounds restriction
**Cause**: The calendar UI rendering logic is not properly graying out or disabling the dates that fall outside the specified bounds. This is likely because the calendar grid needs to show a complete week view, including days from the previous month, but is failing to properly mark these dates as unselectable.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Bounds validation is not being enforced at the UI interaction level
**Cause**: The DateInput component's bounds checking appears to only be implemented at the value setting level, but not at the UI interaction level. This means while the component might have proper bounds defined, the click/selection handlers aren't properly preventing selection of out-of-bounds dates.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete bounds validation in the DateInput component. While the component accepts bounds parameters ['2020-07-01', '2020-07-31'], it fails to properly enforce these restrictions at multiple levels:
1. The UI level - showing selectable dates outside bounds
2. The interaction level - allowing selection of invalid dates
3. The validation level - not properly preventing out-of-bounds date selections

This appears to be a bug in the Grommet DateInput component that requires fixing the date validation logic and ensuring proper UI feedback for out-of-bounds dates.
