### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The user can select a date outside the specified bounds (`['2020-07-01', '2020-07-31']`), specifically the last day of the previous month (`2020-06-30`).

**Cause**: The DateInput component does not properly disable or prevent the selection of dates outside the defined bounds. The bounds are not being enforced correctly, allowing the user to select dates that fall outside the specified range.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The calendar is displaying the month of June 2020, even though the bounds are set for July 2020.

**Cause**: The DateInput component is not correctly updating the calendar view to reflect the bounds. The calendar is showing the previous month (June 2020) instead of the current month (July 2020) as specified in the bounds.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current value displayed (`2020-06-30T08:00:00.000Z`) is outside the specified bounds.

**Cause**: The DateInput component is not validating the selected date against the bounds before setting it as the current value. This allows the component to accept and display a date that is outside the specified range.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The DateInput component has multiple issues related to enforcing the specified bounds. It allows the selection of dates outside the bounds, displays the wrong month in the calendar, and does not validate the selected date against the bounds. These issues need to be addressed to ensure that the DateInput component correctly enforces the specified date range.
