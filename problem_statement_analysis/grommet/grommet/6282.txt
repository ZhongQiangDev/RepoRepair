Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Data table sorting fails when a property value is null or undefined
**Cause**: The sorting algorithm likely doesn't have proper handling for null/undefined values, causing unexpected behavior when comparing these values with regular strings or numbers. Instead of treating them as empty strings as expected, the null/undefined values are probably maintained as-is during comparisons.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent display order when sorting by Parent_id column
**Cause**: Based on the screenshot and description, the Parent_id column contains mixed data types (some actual values and some null/undefined values). Without proper type coercion or handling of null/undefined values, the sorting algorithm can't establish a consistent ordering between defined and undefined values.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Sorting doesn't treat undefined properties as empty strings
**Cause**: The implementation doesn't follow the expected behavior of converting undefined values to empty strings before comparison. This indicates a missing data normalization step in the sorting logic.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of null/undefined values in the Grommet Data Table's sorting mechanism. The sorting algorithm needs to be modified to:
1. Properly handle null/undefined values
2. Implement consistent type coercion
3. Convert undefined properties to empty strings before comparison
4. Ensure consistent sorting behavior regardless of property value types

This appears to be a bug in the Grommet library's implementation rather than a user error, as it's reproducible across different versions (2.23.0 and 2.25.1).
