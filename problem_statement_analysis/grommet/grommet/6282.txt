### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When sorting the "Parent" column, items with `null` or `undefined` values for the `Parent_id` property are not sorted as expected.
**Cause**: The sorting algorithm does not handle `null` or `undefined` values correctly. It likely compares these values with other values in a way that disrupts the expected order. For example, it might treat `null` or `undefined` as the lowest or highest value, causing them to be sorted incorrectly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The sorting function does not treat `null` or `undefined` properties as empty strings, as expected.
**Cause**: The sorting logic is not configured to convert `null` or `undefined` values to empty strings before performing the comparison. This means that when the sorting function encounters these values, it does not handle them in the same way as other string values, leading to unexpected sorting behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the sorting algorithm does not handle `null` or `undefined` values appropriately. To fix this, the sorting logic should be updated to convert `null` or `undefined` values to empty strings before performing comparisons. This will ensure that items with `null` or `undefined` properties are sorted as expected, treating them as empty strings. Additionally, the sorting algorithm should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles all types of values, including `null`, `undefined`, and empty strings, to maintain the expected order.
