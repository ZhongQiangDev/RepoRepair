Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: All radio buttons are displaying the blue background color (#3b5ed8) instead of only the checked radio button
**Cause**: The CSS styling for `radioButton.check.background.color` is being applied globally to all radio button elements rather than being scoped to only the `:checked` state. This appears to be a selector specificity issue in the component's styling implementation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The default grey color for unchecked radio buttons is not being preserved
**Cause**: The current styling implementation is overriding the default styles for all radio buttons, without properly distinguishing between checked and unchecked states. The CSS selector hierarchy needs to be adjusted to properly target only checked radio buttons.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The styling configuration in the theme object isn't properly handling state-based styling
**Cause**: The theme configuration structure for radio buttons doesn't appear to have proper support for state-specific styling (checked vs unchecked). The current implementation is treating the `check` property as a general style rather than a state-specific style.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper CSS selector implementation and theme configuration structure in the radio button component. The styling is being applied globally instead of being state-specific, resulting in all radio buttons showing the same background color regardless of their checked state. This needs to be fixed by:
1. Properly scoping the background color to only checked radio buttons
2. Preserving default styles for unchecked state
3. Implementing proper state-based styling support in the theme configuration

The fix would likely involve modifying both the component's CSS implementation and the theme configuration structure to properly handle state-based styling.
