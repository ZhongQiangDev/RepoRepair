### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: All radio buttons are displaying the blue background color instead of just the checked one.
**Cause**: The CSS styling is being applied to all radio buttons instead of just the checked one. This is likely due to the CSS selector being too broad and not specifically targeting the checked radio button.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The background color is not being applied only to the currently checked radio button.
**Cause**: The CSS code provided does not include a specific selector for the checked state of the radio button. The `check` property in the code is not a valid CSS selector for targeting the checked state of a radio button.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of only the checked radio button changing color is not being achieved.
**Cause**: The CSS code provided is not correctly targeting the checked state of the radio button. The `check` property in the code is not a valid CSS selector for targeting the checked state of a radio button. The correct CSS selector for targeting the checked state of a radio button is `:checked`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the CSS code provided is not correctly targeting the checked state of the radio button. The `check` property in the code is not a valid CSS selector for targeting the checked state of a radio button. The correct CSS selector for targeting the checked state of a radio button is `:checked`. To fix this issue, the CSS code should be updated to use the `:checked` selector to target only the checked radio button and apply the background color to it.
