Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Select component's dropdown arrow icon is not visible against the dark background
**Cause**: The arrow icon likely has a dark color (possibly black or dark gray) that blends into the dark background, resulting in poor contrast and visibility issues

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of proper color contrast in the Select component's UI elements
**Cause**: The component's styling doesn't account for dark background use cases, suggesting missing theme-aware color handling or insufficient contrast ratio considerations in the design system

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from poor color contrast between the Select component's arrow icon and its dark background. This appears to be a theming/styling oversight where the component's default dark-colored arrow doesn't adapt to provide sufficient visibility when used on dark backgrounds. To fix this, the component would need either:
1. Dynamic color adaptation based on background color
2. A higher contrast color scheme for the arrow icon
3. Or specific styling overrides for dark background usage

The provided CodeSandbox link (2x9656290y) would help confirm the exact implementation details, but the screenshot clearly shows this is primarily a UI contrast/visibility issue.
