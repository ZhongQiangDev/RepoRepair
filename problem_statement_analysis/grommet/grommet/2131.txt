### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The arrow icon for the Select component is not visible on a dark background.
**Cause**: The color of the arrow icon is likely set to a light color, which blends into the dark background, making it invisible. This could be due to the CSS styling of the arrow icon not being adjusted for dark mode or dark backgrounds.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The contrast between the arrow icon and the background is insufficient.
**Cause**: The current design does not account for varying background colors, leading to poor contrast when the background is dark. This could be due to a lack of conditional styling based on the background color or theme.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Select component does not adapt to different themes (light vs. dark).
**Cause**: The Select component may not be designed to be theme-aware. This means it does not automatically adjust its colors and styles based on the current theme, leading to issues like the invisible arrow on a dark background.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the visibility of the arrow icon on a dark background, caused by insufficient contrast and a lack of theme adaptability in the Select component's styling. To resolve this, the arrow icon's color should be dynamically adjusted based on the background color or theme, ensuring it remains visible and maintains adequate contrast in all scenarios. This can be achieved by implementing conditional CSS styling or using a theme-aware design approach.
