### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The client ID is lost when the user switches from the signup form to the login form and back again, causing the styling to be lost upon page reload.
**Cause**: The client ID is not being preserved in the URL or session storage when the user navigates between the signup and login forms. This results in the loss of the client-specific styling and functionality when the page is reloaded.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user is redirected to the standard WordPress.com login page instead of the styled login page after reloading.
**Cause**: The URL parameters, specifically the `client_id`, are not being retained when the user navigates back to the login form. This causes the system to default to the standard login page instead of the client-specific login page.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected styled login page is not displayed after the user reloads the page.
**Cause**: The application logic does not properly handle the preservation and restoration of URL parameters, particularly the `client_id`, during navigation and page reloads. This leads to the loss of the client-specific context and styling.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the loss of the `client_id` parameter when the user navigates between the signup and login forms and reloads the page. This results in the loss of client-specific styling and functionality. The causes include the failure to preserve the `client_id` in the URL or session storage, and the application logic not properly handling the restoration of this parameter during navigation and page reloads. Addressing these issues will ensure that the user is presented with the correct styled login page upon reload.
