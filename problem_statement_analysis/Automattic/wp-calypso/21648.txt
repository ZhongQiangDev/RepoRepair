Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and screenshot.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: HTML entity &#039; (representing an apostrophe) is displayed in raw form in the "From name" field placeholder instead of showing the actual apostrophe character
**Cause**: The text is not being properly HTML-decoded before being displayed in the form field. The system is showing the raw HTML entity code instead of converting it to its corresponding character representation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between the site title display in the sidebar (showing proper apostrophe) versus the form field (showing HTML entity)
**Cause**: Different parts of the application are handling the HTML entity decoding differently:
- The sidebar component properly decodes the HTML entities
- The email settings form component fails to decode the entities, suggesting inconsistent text processing across components

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor user experience when the form field is cleared
**Cause**: When the field is cleared, the system falls back to a placeholder value that contains unprocessed HTML entities, indicating that the placeholder text generation/processing pipeline isn't properly handling special characters

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper HTML entity handling in the email settings form component, specifically in the "From name" field. While some parts of the application correctly decode HTML entities (like the sidebar), the form field placeholder fails to do so, resulting in raw HTML entities being displayed to users. This creates both a visual inconsistency and poor user experience. The fix would likely involve adding proper HTML entity decoding to the form field placeholder generation process, ensuring consistent text processing across all components of the application.
