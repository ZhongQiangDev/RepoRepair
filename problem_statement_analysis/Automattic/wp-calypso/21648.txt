### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "From Name" field displays an undecoded entity (`Allendav&#039;s Store Test Site`) instead of the expected decoded text (`Allendav's Store Test Site`).
**Cause**: The issue arises because the system is not properly decoding HTML entities when populating the "From Name" field. The apostrophe (`'`) is encoded as `&#039;`, which should be decoded to `'` before being displayed in the field.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The "From Name" field does not automatically update to reflect the decoded version of the site title when the field is cleared and the page is reloaded.
**Cause**: There might be a missing or incorrect function that is responsible for decoding HTML entities in the site title before populating the "From Name" field. This function may not be triggered when the page is loaded or when the field is cleared.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The system does not handle special characters in the site title correctly, leading to the display of encoded entities.
**Cause**: The system may be encoding special characters in the site title for security or compatibility reasons but fails to decode them when they are used in the "From Name" field. This could be due to a lack of proper encoding/decoding logic in the relevant part of the codebase.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the improper handling of HTML entities in the "From Name" field. The system encodes special characters in the site title but does not decode them when they are used in the "From Name" field. This results in the display of undecoded entities. To fix this, the system needs to ensure that HTML entities are properly decoded before being displayed in the "From Name" field. Additionally, the system should have a mechanism to automatically update the "From Name" field with the decoded version of the site title when the field is cleared or the page is reloaded.
