### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The success screen is displayed even if the user hasn't inserted a contact form.
**Cause**: The current logic might not be checking whether a contact form has been inserted before showing the success screen. This could be due to a missing conditional check in the code that verifies the form insertion status.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The contact form tile is not displayed when the user hasn't inserted a contact form.
**Cause**: The logic for displaying the contact form tile might be incorrectly implemented. It could be that the condition to show the tile is not properly set or the state management for form insertion is not correctly updated.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Users are not redirected to the Jetpack Connect (JPC) flow if they haven't connected and try to reach step 4 again.
**Cause**: The redirection logic might be missing or incorrectly implemented. The application might not be checking the connection status before allowing the user to proceed to step 4, or the redirection logic might not be triggered properly.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The actual contact form insertion happens before the user has connected.
**Cause**: The form insertion process might be triggered prematurely, before the connection status is verified. This could be due to the form insertion logic being placed in the wrong part of the code flow, or the connection status check might be missing or incorrectly implemented.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues identified include the premature display of the success screen, incorrect display of the contact form tile, lack of redirection to the JPC flow, and premature form insertion. These problems stem from missing or incorrect conditional checks, improper state management, and incorrect placement of form insertion logic. Addressing these issues will require revising the conditional checks, ensuring proper state management, and correctly placing the form insertion logic after the connection status is verified.
