Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the issues and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Contact form is being inserted before user connection is established
**Cause**: The current implementation allows the contact form to be created before the user completes the Jetpack connection process, which is not the intended workflow

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent user flow when revisiting step 4 without connection
**Cause**: The system lacks proper state management to handle scenarios where users try to access step 4 again without having completed the Jetpack connection

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No clear success state visualization after form insertion
**Cause**: The UI doesn't have a dedicated success screen to confirm when users have successfully inserted and connected their contact form

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Unclear transition between contact form tile and success screen
**Cause**: The system needs better logic to determine when to show the contact form tile versus the success screen based on the user's connection and form insertion status

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around improper sequencing of the contact form insertion process and inadequate UI feedback. The contact form should only be insertable after Jetpack connection is established. The system needs better state management to handle different user scenarios (connected vs. not connected, form inserted vs. not inserted) and clearer UI indicators for success states. These issues appear to stem from a lack of proper workflow enforcement and incomplete user experience design for different states of the onboarding process.
