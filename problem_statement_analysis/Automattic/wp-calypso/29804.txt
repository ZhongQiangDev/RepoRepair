### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The text mentions "No ads or limits" in relation to video and audio posts, which is misleading because there is a storage limit on the WordPress.com Premium plan.
**Cause**: The copywriting on the "checkout thank you" page has not been updated to reflect the actual limitations of the Premium plan, leading to confusion for users who expect unlimited storage.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The statement "The Premium plan also adds 10GB of file storage" is confusing for users upgrading from the Personal plan, which already includes 6GB of storage.
**Cause**: The copy does not clearly communicate the total storage available after upgrading, leading users to believe they are getting an additional 10GB on top of their existing storage, rather than a total of 13GB.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from unclear and misleading copy on the "checkout thank you" page. The text needs to be revised to remove the reference to "no limits" and to clarify the total storage available with the Premium plan, ensuring users understand they will have 13GB of storage in total, regardless of their starting plan. This will help prevent confusion and provide a clearer understanding of the benefits of upgrading to the Premium plan.
