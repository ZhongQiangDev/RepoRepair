Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Misleading "no limits" statement in the feature description
**Cause**: The copy text incorrectly states there are "no limits" when there actually is a specific storage limit for the WordPress.com Premium plan. This is factually incorrect and could mislead customers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Ambiguous storage space description
**Cause**: The current text states "adds 10GB of file storage" which is only accurate for free plan upgrades but not for Personal plan upgrades. This creates confusion because Personal plan users already have 6GB of storage, so they won't actually get an additional 10GB when upgrading to Premium.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent storage information across different upgrade paths
**Cause**: The messaging doesn't account for different user scenarios (free plan vs Personal plan upgrades), leading to potential misunderstandings about the final storage amount available. The actual total storage space (13GB) is not clearly communicated.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from unclear and potentially misleading communication about storage limits and space allocation in the WordPress.com Premium plan upgrade process. The current copy fails to accurately represent storage limitations and doesn't clearly communicate the final storage amount available to users. The text needs to be updated to remove the "no limits" claim and should state the total available storage (13GB) rather than referring to incremental additions, which vary depending on the user's starting plan.
