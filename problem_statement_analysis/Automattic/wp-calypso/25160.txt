### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The featured image from the Google library is not being added to the post.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the integration between WordPress and Google's API. The connection might not be properly established, or there could be a problem with the authentication process. This could result in the image not being fetched or saved correctly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user receives a message stating "You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave this page?" after publishing the post.
**Cause**: This message typically appears when the browser detects unsaved changes on the page. In this case, it could be due to the featured image not being properly saved or recognized by the system. The system might still consider the post as having unsaved changes because the featured image is missing.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The featured image is not displayed in the preview.
**Cause**: The issue could be related to the caching mechanism or the way the featured image is being rendered in the preview. If the image is not being fetched or saved correctly, it will not appear in the preview. Additionally, there could be a problem with the way the featured image is being referenced in the post's metadata.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the integration between WordPress and Google's API, the authentication process, and the way the featured image is being saved and rendered. These issues need to be addressed to ensure that the featured image is properly added to the post and displayed in the preview. Additionally, the system should recognize when the featured image has been added to avoid the "unsaved changes" message.
