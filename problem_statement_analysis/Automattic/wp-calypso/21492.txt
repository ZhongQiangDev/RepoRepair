### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `/jetpack/connect/plans` page displays the JPC initial site entry screen instead of the plans page for non-admin users.
**Cause**: The Jetpack Connect flow may not be correctly identifying the user role or permissions, leading to the incorrect display of the initial site entry screen instead of the plans page. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the role-checking logic or an issue with how user roles are being passed or interpreted during the connection process.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: There is a short redirect loop in the URL bar.
**Cause**: The redirect loop might be caused by the system attempting to redirect the user to the correct page but failing due to a mismatch in expected user roles or permissions. This could be a result of the system not properly handling the redirect conditions for non-admin users, leading to repeated attempts to redirect to the appropriate page.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user is not redirected back to wp-admin as expected.
**Cause**: The expected behavior is for the user to be redirected back to wp-admin after connecting the site. However, the current implementation may not have the correct logic in place to handle this redirection for non-admin users. This could be due to missing or incorrect redirection rules in the Jetpack Connect flow for users with different roles.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the incorrect display of the JPC initial site entry screen instead of the plans page, a short redirect loop, and the failure to redirect back to wp-admin. These problems are likely caused by issues in the role-checking logic, incorrect handling of user roles during the connection process, and missing or incorrect redirection rules for non-admin users. Addressing these causes should resolve the observed wrong behaviors and ensure a smoother user experience for all user roles.
