Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: License incompatibility between localForage (Apache 2.0) and WordPress.com/Calypso/Gutenberg (GPLv2)
**Cause**: Apache 2.0 and GPLv2 licenses have different terms and requirements that make them incompatible for use together. Specifically, the Apache 2.0 license contains patent provisions that are not present in GPLv2, creating a legal conflict when combining software under these licenses.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Build script failure in Gutenberg due to license compatibility check
**Cause**: Gutenberg includes a dependency license checking script that detected the incompatible Apache 2.0 license of localForage, causing the build process to fail as a safety measure to prevent license violations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential legal risk for WordPress.com using incompatibly licensed code
**Cause**: WordPress.com is currently using localForage in their Calypso project despite the license incompatibility, which could expose them to legal risks or compliance issues.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a license incompatibility between localForage (Apache 2.0) and WordPress-related projects (GPLv2). This causes build failures in Gutenberg and creates potential legal risks for WordPress.com. The suggested solution is to relicense or dual-license localForage in its next major version to make it compatible with GPLv2. This would resolve the build failures and eliminate legal concerns while allowing continued use of localForage in WordPress projects.
