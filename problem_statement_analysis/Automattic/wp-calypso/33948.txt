### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `localForage` module has an incompatible license 'Apache-2.0' when used with projects licensed under GPLv2.
**Cause**: The Apache 2.0 license is not compatible with the GPLv2 license. Specifically, the Apache 2.0 license contains a patent grant clause that is not present in the GPLv2, making it incompatible. This incompatibility prevents the use of `localForage` in projects that are licensed under GPLv2, such as WordPress.com/Calypso and Gutenberg.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `npm install` command fails due to the license incompatibility.
**Cause**: The `npm install` command triggers a `postinstall` script that runs `check-licenses`. This script checks for license compatibility and fails when it detects the incompatible `localForage` module. The failure of this script causes the `npm install` command to exit with an error, preventing the successful installation of dependencies.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `check-licenses` script exits with code 1 when it detects the incompatible `localForage` module.
**Cause**: The `check-licenses` script is designed to ensure that all dependencies are compatible with the project's license. When it detects a dependency with an incompatible license, it exits with a non-zero status code (in this case, 1) to indicate a failure. This behavior is intended to prevent the use of incompatible dependencies in the project.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the license incompatibility between `localForage` (Apache 2.0) and the projects using it (GPLv2). This incompatibility causes the `npm install` command to fail due to the `check-licenses` script detecting the incompatible module. To resolve this issue, `localForage` could be relicensed or dual-licensed to be compatible with GPLv2, or an alternative compatible module could be used in the projects.
