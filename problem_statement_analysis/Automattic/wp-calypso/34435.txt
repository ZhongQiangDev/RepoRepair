### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The signup flow shows a flash of the account screen at the end of the flow, which is unexpected and may confuse users.
**Cause**: This issue could be due to a delay in the transition between the account creation confirmation and the final screen. The system might be processing the account creation and then quickly moving to the next step, causing a brief flash of the account screen. This could be caused by a lack of proper loading or transition animations, or a delay in the server's response time.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The account details screen appears with a notice stating "Your account has already been created. You can change your email, username, and password later."
**Cause**: This message suggests that the account creation process is being handled asynchronously. The system might be confirming the account creation before moving to the next step, leading to the display of this intermediate screen. This could be due to the backend not properly synchronizing with the frontend, causing the intermediate screen to appear.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The flow then automatically progresses to the next screen (logged-in checklist view for the free plan or checkout for a paid plan) without a smooth transition.
**Cause**: The automatic progression might be due to a lack of proper user feedback or confirmation before moving to the next step. The system might be programmed to automatically advance after a certain delay or upon receiving a confirmation signal from the backend, which could cause the abrupt transition.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the flash of the account screen, the appearance of an intermediate account details screen, and the abrupt transition to the next step. These behaviors are likely caused by delays in processing, asynchronous handling of account creation, and a lack of smooth transitions. Addressing these issues would involve improving the synchronization between the frontend and backend, implementing proper loading animations, and ensuring a more seamless user experience during the signup flow.
