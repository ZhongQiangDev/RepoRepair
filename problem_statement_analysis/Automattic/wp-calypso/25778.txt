### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The system is generating a large number of error notices when it fails to load comments.
**Cause**: The retries for fetching comments are not being limited, leading to repeated attempts to access the replies endpoint which returns a 403 error due to the JSON API being turned off.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error messages are being displayed in a way that overwhelms the user interface.
**Cause**: The system is not designed to handle the error gracefully by showing a single, clear error message in the comments section. Instead, it fires multiple error notices, which can confuse and frustrate the user.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The system continues to attempt to load comments even when it is clear that the JSON API is turned off.
**Cause**: There is no mechanism in place to detect that the JSON API is turned off and to stop the comment loading process accordingly. This results in unnecessary retries and error messages.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are the lack of retry limits, the overwhelming display of error messages, and the absence of a mechanism to detect and handle the JSON API being turned off. Addressing these causes would involve implementing retry limits, displaying a single error message in the comments section, and setting comments to 'off' in the API response if the JSON API is turned off. This would improve the user experience by reducing confusion and unnecessary error notifications.
