Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Priority Support card has inconsistent layout compared to other feature cards (icon on right, content on left)
**Cause**: This appears to be a CSS/styling inconsistency in the card component implementation, where the Priority Support card either:
1. Has different CSS classes applied to it
2. Uses a different component variant
3. Has its layout properties incorrectly set compared to other feature cards

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual hierarchy and scanning pattern is broken
**Cause**: The inconsistent layout disrupts the natural left-to-right reading pattern that users expect when scanning through multiple similar cards. This makes the Priority Support card stand out unintentionally and could confuse users since it doesn't follow the established visual pattern of the other cards.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around an inconsistent layout pattern in the feature cards section, specifically with the Priority Support card having a reversed layout compared to all other cards. This creates both a visual inconsistency and potential usability issues. The root cause appears to be in the implementation of the card component's styling or structure, where the Priority Support card either uses different styling rules or component structure compared to the standard feature cards. This needs to be standardized to maintain consistent user experience across all feature cards.
