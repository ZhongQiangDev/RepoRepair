Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Upgrade nudge is being displayed to users with Editor role
**Cause**: The visibility logic for the upgrade nudge is not checking user roles properly, showing the upgrade prompt to all users regardless of their permission level. Editors don't have the capability to perform site upgrades.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Upgrade nudge is being displayed to users with Author role
**Cause**: Similar to the Editor role issue, the system is not filtering out Author role users from seeing the upgrade nudge, despite them lacking the necessary permissions to upgrade the site.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent user experience based on role permissions
**Cause**: The media page's UI components are not properly aligned with WordPress's role-based permission system, where only administrators should see upgrade-related prompts and options.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper role-based visibility control for the upgrade nudge component on the media page. The system is showing upgrade prompts to Editor and Author roles despite these roles lacking the administrative permissions needed to actually perform site upgrades. This creates unnecessary UI clutter and potentially confusing user experience for non-admin users. The fix would involve adding proper role checking logic to hide the upgrade nudge for all roles except administrators.
