### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The upgrade nudge is visible to users with editor and author roles.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the upgrade nudge does not check the user's role before displaying the nudge. As a result, it is shown to all users, including those who do not have the necessary permissions to upgrade the site.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Editors and authors are presented with an option they cannot act upon.
**Cause**: The system does not properly restrict access to upgrade options based on user roles. This oversight leads to a confusing user experience, as editors and authors see an upgrade link that they cannot use, potentially causing frustration or misleading them about their capabilities.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The upgrade nudge is not role-specific.
**Cause**: The logic for displaying the upgrade nudge is not role-based. Instead, it appears to be based on a general setting that applies to all users, regardless of their role within the site. This lack of role-specific logic results in the nudge being shown to users who should not see it.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the upgrade nudge is displayed to users who do not have the ability to upgrade the site, specifically editors and authors. This is caused by a lack of role-based logic in the display of the nudge, leading to a confusing and potentially frustrating user experience. To resolve this, the system should be updated to check the user's role before displaying the upgrade nudge, ensuring that it is only shown to users who have the necessary permissions to perform an upgrade.
