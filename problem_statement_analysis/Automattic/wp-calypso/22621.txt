From the GitHub problem description and images provided, this appears to be about implementing a new Stats step in Jetpack Onboarding (JPO). However, I'll analyze potential issues that need to be addressed:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Navigation inconsistency during JPC (Jetpack Connect) flow
**Cause**: The JPO wizard navigation (back/skip links) might disappear when transitioning to the JPC flow, as specifically noted in the description that they "need to preserve" these elements

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potentially confusing headings in JPC flow
**Cause**: As mentioned in the description ("we might need alternative copy for the headings"), the current heading text may not properly align with the context of coming from the Stats step

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Unclear user state handling
**Cause**: The flow needs to handle multiple user states (connected vs. not connected) and ensure proper routing between screens, which could lead to edge cases if not properly managed

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Success screen transition timing
**Cause**: The timing between enabling the stats module and showing the success screen needs to be properly managed to avoid showing success before the operation is complete

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: No error state handling shown
**Cause**: The description and mockups don't show how errors would be handled if the stats module fails to enable or if the connection process fails

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around maintaining consistent navigation, improving copy clarity, handling different user states, managing transitions, and implementing proper error handling. The most critical among these appears to be the navigation consistency issue during the JPC flow, as it's explicitly called out in the description. The other issues are implied by the implementation requirements and common UX best practices that would need to be considered for a robust implementation.
