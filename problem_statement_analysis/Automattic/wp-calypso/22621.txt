### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The success screen does not have a "Skip for now" option.
**Cause**: The design of the success screen only includes a "Continue" button, which might not provide users with the flexibility to skip this step if they are not ready to proceed immediately.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The navigation back link is missing on the success screen.
**Cause**: The success screen only shows a "Back" link, which might not be consistent with the previous steps where both "Back" and "Skip for now" options were available. This inconsistency can confuse users who expect the same navigation options throughout the onboarding process.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The introduction screen does not clearly indicate the next steps if the user is already connected.
**Cause**: The introduction screen assumes the user has not connected yet and directs them to the JPC flow. If the user is already connected, the screen should adapt to show the option to enable the Stats module directly, without unnecessary steps.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The JPC flow screens do not preserve the JPO wizard navigation back/skip links at the bottom.
**Cause**: The JPC flow screens are designed independently and do not integrate the navigation elements from the JPO wizard. This can disrupt the user's flow and make it difficult to navigate back or skip steps as needed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified include the lack of a "Skip for now" option on the success screen, the missing navigation back link, unclear instructions for already connected users on the introduction screen, and the absence of JPO wizard navigation elements in the JPC flow screens. These issues can be addressed by ensuring consistency in navigation options, adapting the introduction screen for connected users, and integrating the necessary navigation elements throughout the onboarding process.
