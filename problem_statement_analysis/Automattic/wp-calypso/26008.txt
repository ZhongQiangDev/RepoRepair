### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Embedded Crowdsignal surveys are not displayed in the Reader.
**Cause**: The current detection mechanism in the code only recognizes Polldaddy polls but does not have a similar rule to detect and render Crowdsignal surveys. This results in the surveys not being displayed as expected.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Polldaddy embeds are not being displayed in the Reader.
**Cause**: The detection and rendering logic for Polldaddy embeds in the Reader is either missing or not functioning correctly. This leads to the embeds not being displayed, leaving the post empty if the embed is the only content.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The post appears completely empty in the Reader when it contains only a Polldaddy survey.
**Cause**: The absence of a proper fallback or placeholder content when the embed fails to display results in an empty post. This can be due to the lack of error handling or content rendering logic for such cases.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the lack of proper detection and rendering rules for both Crowdsignal surveys and Polldaddy embeds in the Reader. Additionally, there is a need for better error handling and fallback content to prevent posts from appearing empty when embeds fail to display. Addressing these causes will ensure that embedded content is displayed correctly and enhance the user experience in the Reader.
