Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The prop name `showEmailSettings` is semantically incorrect for its current functionality
**Cause**: The popover now handles both new post notifications and email notification settings, making the prop name `showEmailSettings` too specific and not accurately reflecting its broader scope of functionality

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Recommended sites under the search box may incorrectly show a 'Settings' link for followed sites
**Cause**: The UI logic is not properly distinguishing between regular followed sites and recommended sites when determining whether to display the settings link, leading to inconsistent behavior in the recommended sites section

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential confusion in the notification settings UI with multiple notification types
**Cause**: The UI now handles multiple types of notifications (new post notifications, new post emails, and new comment emails) but the naming convention in the code doesn't clearly reflect this expanded functionality

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around naming conventions and UI consistency. The primary problem is that the codebase's naming (`showEmailSettings`) hasn't kept pace with the expanded functionality of the notification system. This has led to both semantic inconsistencies in the code and UI display issues where settings links appear in inappropriate contexts (recommended sites section). The solution involves both renaming the prop to `showNotificationSettings` to better reflect its current purpose and ensuring the UI correctly handles the display of settings links based on the site's context (recommended vs. followed).
