### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The prop `showEmailSettings` is outdated and does not accurately reflect the current functionality of the popover, which now includes both new post notifications and email notification settings.
**Cause**: The original naming of the prop did not anticipate the expansion of its functionality to include new post notifications. As a result, the prop name is misleading and does not accurately describe its current purpose.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The 'Settings' link appears under recommended sites in the search box, even when it should not.
**Cause**: There may be a conditional logic error in the code that determines whether the 'Settings' link should be displayed. This could be due to incorrect conditions or a lack of proper checks to ensure the link is only shown when appropriate.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The recommended sites under the search box have a 'Settings' link, even if the user is following one of them.
**Cause**: The code responsible for rendering the 'Settings' link might not be correctly identifying whether the user is following a site. This could be due to an issue with the data being passed to the component or a problem with the logic that checks the user's following status.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the outdated prop name `showEmailSettings`, which needs to be renamed to `showNotificationSettings` to accurately reflect its current functionality, and the incorrect display of the 'Settings' link under recommended sites. The causes include a mismatch between the prop name and its functionality, potential conditional logic errors, and issues with identifying the user's following status. Addressing these causes will ensure that the prop name is accurate and that the 'Settings' link is displayed correctly.
