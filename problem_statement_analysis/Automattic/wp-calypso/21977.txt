### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The green success banner is not displayed after a successful Stripe Connect account creation.
**Cause**: The code responsible for rendering the success banner might not be triggered or included in the current implementation of the Stripe Connect flow. This could be due to missing event listeners, incorrect conditional statements, or an oversight in the UI update logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user does not receive immediate visual confirmation of a successful connection.
**Cause**: The backend might not be sending the necessary success signal to the frontend, or the frontend might not be listening for this signal. This could be due to an incomplete API response handling or a misconfigured success callback function.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user experience is incomplete as it lacks the expected visual feedback.
**Cause**: The design or user interface guidelines might not have been fully implemented or followed. This could be due to a lack of communication between the design and development teams, or an oversight during the implementation phase.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the absence of a green success banner after a successful Stripe Connect account creation. This could be caused by missing or incorrect implementation of the success banner rendering logic, improper handling of backend success signals, or a lack of adherence to design guidelines. Addressing these causes will ensure that users receive the expected visual confirmation and improve the overall user experience.
