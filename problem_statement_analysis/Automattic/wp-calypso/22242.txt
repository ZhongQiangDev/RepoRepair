Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Jetpack Connect fails to recognize that Jetpack is already installed and activated on the site when a wp-admin URL is entered
**Cause**: The URL validation/checking system doesn't properly handle or strip the "/wp-admin" suffix from the input URL, leading to incorrect site status detection

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: System shows "Ready for installation" step even though Jetpack is already installed
**Cause**: The site status checking mechanism is likely only validating the base domain without properly checking the actual Jetpack installation status on the target site

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Generates incorrect redirect URL with duplicate "/wp-admin" paths
**Cause**: The URL construction logic is concatenating paths without checking for existing "/wp-admin" segments, resulting in malformed URLs like "/wp-admin/wp-admin/"

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Final redirect results in a 404 error
**Cause**: The malformed URL with duplicate "/wp-admin" paths creates an invalid path that doesn't exist on the WordPress site's file system

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from improper URL handling in the Jetpack Connect flow, specifically:
1. Lack of proper URL normalization when handling wp-admin URLs
2. Insufficient site status checking
3. Problematic URL path construction leading to duplicate segments
4. These issues combine to create both a poor user experience and technical errors in the connection process

The main focus for fixing these issues should be improving the URL handling system and implementing proper validation of both the input URLs and the target site's Jetpack installation status.
