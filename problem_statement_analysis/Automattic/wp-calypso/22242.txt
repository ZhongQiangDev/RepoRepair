### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Jetpack Connect does not recognize that the URL entered is for the WP Admin dashboard and proceeds with the installation process.
**Cause**: The Jetpack Connect system lacks a mechanism to detect and handle URLs that end with `/wp-admin`. This oversight leads to the system treating the URL as a regular site URL, even though it is specifically for the admin dashboard.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Jetpack Connect prompts the user to install Jetpack even when it is already installed and activated on the site.
**Cause**: The system fails to check the installation status of Jetpack on the site before proceeding with the installation process. This could be due to a lack of proper validation or communication with the site's database to confirm the plugin's status.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The system generates a URL with a double `/wp-admin` path, resulting in a 404 error.
**Cause**: The URL generation logic in Jetpack Connect does not account for the possibility of a `/wp-admin` suffix in the original URL. This results in the concatenation of another `/wp-admin` segment, leading to an invalid URL.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from Jetpack Connect's inability to properly handle URLs ending with `/wp-admin`, its failure to check the installation status of Jetpack on the site, and a flaw in URL generation logic. Addressing these causes would involve implementing a detection mechanism for `/wp-admin` URLs, adding a validation step to confirm Jetpack's installation status, and refining the URL generation process to avoid duplication of path segments.
