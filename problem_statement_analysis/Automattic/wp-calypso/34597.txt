### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The nudge appears on the `/earn/ads-earnings/` page for users without WordAds access.
**Cause**: The system does not properly check user permissions before displaying the nudge. This results in non-administrators seeing options they should not have access to.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: After deleting all items from the cart, non-administrators gain access to restricted sections.
**Cause**: The application lacks proper authorization checks after the cart is emptied. This allows users to bypass access restrictions and view content they are not authorized to see.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-administrators can reach the checkout page but encounter a broken flow with no on-screen error message.
**Cause**: The system does not prevent non-administrators from proceeding to the checkout page. Additionally, there is no user-friendly error message to inform them of their lack of authorization, leading to a confusing and broken user experience.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Upgrade nudges are visible to non-administrators, leading them to the Plans page where they cannot complete a purchase.
**Cause**: The application does not filter out upgrade nudges for non-administrators. This results in users seeing options they cannot act upon, leading to frustration and a poor user experience.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: The checkout page fails to load completely for non-administrators, with a console error indicating that only administrators can make purchases.
**Cause**: The backend logic does not properly handle requests from non-administrators, resulting in a console error instead of a user-friendly error message. This technical error disrupts the user flow and provides no clear guidance to the user.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from inadequate permission checks and user role validation throughout the application. The system fails to properly restrict access to certain features and pages for non-administrators, leading to broken flows and confusing user experiences. Implementing robust authorization checks and user-friendly error messages will help resolve these problems and improve the overall user experience.
