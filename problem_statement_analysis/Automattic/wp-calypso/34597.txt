I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from this GitHub issue description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-administrator users see upgrade nudges throughout Calypso that they cannot actually use
**Cause**: Missing user role validation before displaying upgrade nudges. The system is not checking the user's permission level before showing upgrade-related UI elements and calls-to-action.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-administrators can access the Plans page and attempt to make purchases
**Cause**: Insufficient access control at the Plans page level. While the backend prevents non-admin purchases, the frontend is not properly gating access to these pages based on user roles.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The checkout page loads for non-administrators but fails silently
**Cause**: Error handling is inadequate. While there is a console error ("Only administrators can make new purchases"), there's no user-facing error message or proper redirect when unauthorized users attempt to make purchases.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Unauthorized users can access Ads Earnings and Ads Settings pages
**Cause**: Missing permission checks for ads-related features. The system is not properly validating whether the user has WordAds access or appropriate permissions before allowing access to these sections.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Removing items from cart leads to inconsistent authorization state
**Cause**: Cart state management issues affecting authorization checks. The system's authorization logic appears to be improperly tied to cart state, causing permission validation to break when the cart is emptied.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from insufficient permission checking and validation at multiple levels:
1. UI level - showing inappropriate upgrade options to non-admins
2. Page access level - allowing access to restricted pages
3. Feature access level - not properly gating ads-related features
4. Error handling - failing to properly communicate authorization errors
5. State management - cart operations affecting authorization logic

The system needs a comprehensive permission management system that consistently validates user roles and permissions across all these layers, with proper error handling and user communication when access is restricted.
