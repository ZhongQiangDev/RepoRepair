### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The app banner is displayed within the mobile app.
**Cause**: The app banner is likely designed to appear on web pages to encourage users to download the app. However, it is not being properly suppressed when the user is already within the app, leading to confusion and redundancy.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The presence of the app banner disrupts the user experience.
**Cause**: The banner takes up screen space and may distract users from the content they are trying to view. This can be particularly frustrating for users who are already using the app and do not need to be prompted to download it again.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The banner may lead to user confusion.
**Cause**: Users might be confused about why they are being prompted to open the app when they are already using it. This can lead to a negative perception of the app and its user interface.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the display of the app banner within the mobile app, which is unnecessary and disruptive. This behavior is likely due to a design oversight where the banner is not properly hidden when the user is already within the app. Addressing this issue by ensuring the banner is only displayed on web pages and not within the app will improve the user experience and reduce confusion.
