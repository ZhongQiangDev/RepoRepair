Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: App banner appearing within the mobile app itself when users are already using the app
**Cause**: The web view component used to display site content is likely not communicating its "in-app" context to the website, causing the website to treat it as a regular mobile browser visit and display the app promotion banner

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Redundant user experience and wasted screen space
**Cause**: Lack of proper user context detection in the app's webview implementation, which should suppress promotional elements when content is being viewed from within the native app

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potentially confusing call-to-action for users
**Cause**: Missing conditional logic in the app banner code that should check whether the user is already using the official WordPress app before displaying the promotion

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper context handling between the mobile app's webview and the WordPress website. The app fails to communicate its native context to the website, resulting in unnecessary app promotion banners being displayed to users who are already using the app. This creates a redundant and potentially confusing user experience. The solution would likely involve either implementing proper user-agent detection, adding specific headers in the webview requests, or creating an app-specific parameter to suppress promotional elements when viewing content within the native app environment.
