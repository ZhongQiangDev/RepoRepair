### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Products cannot be added to the store if the category contains an "&" symbol.
**Cause**: The system is likely not properly handling the "&" symbol in the category name. This could be due to encoding issues where the "&" symbol is not being properly escaped or encoded, leading to a parsing error when the system attempts to save the product.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message "There was a problem saving" "Please try again" is displayed when attempting to save a product in a category containing an "&".
**Cause**: The error message suggests that the system is encountering an unexpected issue during the save process. This could be due to a validation error or a database constraint that is not being properly handled when the "&" symbol is present in the category name.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only affects products added through the WordPress.com store interface and not those added via WP-Admin.
**Cause**: There may be a difference in how the category data is processed or validated between the WordPress.com store interface and WP-Admin. The store interface might have stricter validation rules or a different method of handling special characters like "&".

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inability to add products to the store when the category contains an "&" symbol. This is likely due to encoding or validation issues within the system. The error message indicates a problem during the save process, and the discrepancy between the WordPress.com store interface and WP-Admin suggests a difference in how category data is handled. Addressing the encoding and validation of special characters in category names should resolve the issue.
