### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The word "account." appears on its own line, creating a widow.
**Cause**: The text within the "Priority support" card does not have proper CSS styling to prevent widows. The `preventWidows()` function was attempted but did not work due to the presence of the `<strong />` component within the text.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `preventWidows()` function does not work as expected when applied to `this.getSupportText()`.
**Cause**: The `preventWidows()` function may not be compatible with the `<strong />` component, which is part of the text content. This could be due to how the function processes HTML elements within the text.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The text layout changes when the browser is resized, leading to inconsistent display.
**Cause**: The CSS for the "Priority support" card lacks responsive design considerations. The text wrapping and line breaks are not managed effectively across different screen sizes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the widow created by the word "account." appearing on its own line. This is caused by a lack of proper CSS styling to prevent widows, compounded by the incompatibility of the `preventWidows()` function with the `<strong />` component. Additionally, the text layout is inconsistent across different screen sizes due to a lack of responsive design in the CSS. Addressing these issues will require modifying the CSS to handle widows effectively and ensuring the `preventWidows()` function works with the existing HTML structure.
