Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: American Express card number is being formatted in groups of 4 digits (1234 1234 5612 345)
**Cause**: The checkout system is using a universal formatting rule that groups all credit card numbers in sets of 4 digits, without distinguishing between different card types. This appears to be a code-level issue where card type-specific formatting rules are not being implemented.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual inconsistency with American Express's official format
**Cause**: The system lacks card-type detection and specific formatting rules for American Express cards, which should follow the 4-6-5 digit grouping pattern (1234 123456 12345).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential user confusion during number verification
**Cause**: The mismatch between how the number appears on the physical card (4-6-5 format) versus how it's displayed in the form field (4-4-4-3 format) makes it harder for users to verify their input, potentially leading to errors or abandoned transactions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the checkout system's implementation of a one-size-fits-all approach to credit card number formatting. The system needs to:
1. Properly detect card types
2. Implement card-specific formatting rules
3. Apply the correct format for American Express cards (4-6-5)
These changes would improve user experience and reduce confusion during the checkout process.

The main technical solution would involve modifying the credit card input field to recognize card types and apply the appropriate formatting rules for each card issuer, particularly implementing the correct 4-6-5 digit grouping for American Express cards.
