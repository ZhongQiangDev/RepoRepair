### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The American Express card number is not formatted correctly during checkout. Instead of displaying in the format `1234 123456 12345`, it is displayed as `1234 1234 5612 345`.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the card number formatting logic is hardcoded to group digits in sets of four, which is suitable for Visa and Mastercard but not for American Express. This lack of card type-specific formatting leads to the incorrect display of the American Express card number.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The checkout process may cause confusion for customers who are trying to verify their card number before submitting it.
**Cause**: The incorrect formatting of the American Express card number deviates from the standard format that customers are familiar with. This discrepancy can lead to uncertainty and hesitation during the checkout process, potentially resulting in abandoned transactions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect formatting of American Express card numbers during checkout, caused by a hardcoded formatting logic that groups digits in sets of four. This leads to a wrong behavior where the card number is displayed in an unfamiliar format, causing confusion for customers. To resolve this, the formatting logic should be updated to recognize and format American Express card numbers correctly, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly checkout experience.
