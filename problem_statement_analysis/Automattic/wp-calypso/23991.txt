Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Are You Sure?" (AYS) dialog appears when pressing the back button after adding and removing a featured image on a new post, even though no actual changes were made to the post content.
**Cause**: The system is likely tracking the featured image state changes (add/remove operations) as modifications to the post, without properly checking if the final state matches the initial state. This causes the dirty flag to be set incorrectly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between new posts and existing saved posts - the issue only occurs with new posts.
**Cause**: The post state tracking mechanism appears to handle state differently for new vs. saved posts. For new posts, it may be using a simpler or different state comparison that doesn't properly account for the featured image's final state, while saved posts likely have a more robust state comparison mechanism.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The dirty flag state is not being reset when the featured image is removed, returning to the original state.
**Cause**: The post editor's state management system is not properly implementing state reconciliation - it's tracking individual actions (add image, remove image) rather than comparing the final state with the initial state to determine if actual changes exist.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper state management in the WordPress.com post editor, specifically around featured image handling for new posts. The system incorrectly marks the post as "dirty" (modified) when a featured image is added and then removed, even though the final state matches the initial state. This behavior is inconsistent between new and saved posts, suggesting different state tracking mechanisms are in place for each scenario. The root cause appears to be in how the editor tracks changes - focusing on individual actions rather than comparing initial and final states to determine if actual changes exist that would warrant showing the "Are You Sure?" dialog when navigating away.
