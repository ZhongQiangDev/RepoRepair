### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Are You Sure?" (AYS) dialog appears when navigating away from a new post after adding and removing a featured image, even though there are no unsaved changes.
**Cause**: The system incorrectly marks the post as "dirty" (indicating unsaved changes) when the featured image is added and then removed. This could be due to a bug in the state management of the featured image feature, where the system fails to properly reset the "dirty" flag when the image is removed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The AYS dialog does not appear when performing the same actions on an existing post.
**Cause**: The state management for existing posts might be different from that of new posts. The system might have a more robust mechanism for detecting changes in existing posts, which correctly identifies that no changes have been made after adding and removing the featured image.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is specific to new posts and not reproducible with existing posts.
**Cause**: There might be a difference in how new posts and existing posts are initialized in the system. The initialization process for new posts might not properly set up the state tracking, leading to the incorrect "dirty" flag being set.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the system incorrectly marks new posts as "dirty" when a featured image is added and then removed, leading to the AYS dialog appearing. This is likely due to a bug in the state management of the featured image feature for new posts. The system's handling of existing posts appears to be more robust, correctly identifying that no changes have been made. The difference in behavior between new and existing posts suggests a potential issue in the initialization process for new posts.
