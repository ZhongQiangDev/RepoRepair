### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Edit" link does not fully enter the edit mode; instead, it causes the page to enter a weird state where the top and side bars disappear, but the reader content is still displayed.
**Cause**: This issue could be due to a JavaScript error or a misconfiguration in the event handler for the "Edit" link. The script responsible for transitioning the page into edit mode might be failing, leading to the page elements not updating as expected.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The presence of an "Edit" link in the feed for posts that should not be editable.
**Cause**: There might be a logic error in the backend code that determines whether an "Edit" link should be displayed. The code might not be correctly identifying the context or permissions for the posts, leading to the display of the "Edit" link even when it shouldn't be there.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The page layout becomes inconsistent when the "Edit" link is clicked, with the top and side bars disappearing.
**Cause**: This could be due to a CSS issue where the styles for the edit mode are not being applied correctly. Alternatively, it could be a problem with the DOM manipulation code that is supposed to hide or show certain elements when entering edit mode.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the failure of the "Edit" link to properly transition the page into edit mode, the incorrect display of the "Edit" link in the feed, and the inconsistent page layout when the link is clicked. The causes likely involve JavaScript errors, backend logic errors, and CSS or DOM manipulation issues. Addressing these causes will require debugging the JavaScript code, reviewing the backend logic for displaying the "Edit" link, and ensuring proper CSS and DOM handling for the edit mode.
