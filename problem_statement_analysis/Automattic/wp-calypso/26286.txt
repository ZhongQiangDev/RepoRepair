### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The app banner related to Stats is shown on the `/activity` page.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the app banner only checks for the `/stats` path and does not differentiate between `/stats` and `/activity`. This is evident from the code snippet in `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx#L149`, which only looks for `/stats` in the Redux state.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The app banner is displayed on mobile devices when it should not be.
**Cause**: The current logic for displaying the app banner does not account for the specific path being visited. The Redux state lacks the necessary information to discriminate between `/stats` and `/activity`, leading to the banner being shown incorrectly on the `/activity` page.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The app banner is not being excluded on the `/activity` page.
**Cause**: The existing code does not have a mechanism to exclude the app banner based on the current path. The banner is shown based on the presence of `/stats` in the path, but there is no logic to handle other paths like `/activity`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the app banner is incorrectly displayed on the `/activity` page due to the current implementation only checking for the `/stats` path. The Redux state lacks the necessary information to differentiate between `/stats` and `/activity`, leading to the banner being shown incorrectly. To fix this, the code needs to be updated to include logic that can properly discriminate between different paths and exclude the app banner on the `/activity` page. This will ensure that the banner is only shown on the appropriate pages and not on the `/activity` page.
