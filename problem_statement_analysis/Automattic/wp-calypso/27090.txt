Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: View counts are missing from the Blog Posts list in the "After" screenshot
**Cause**: The feature was removed due to performance concerns with the previous implementation, which was likely making too many individual requests for view counts and causing high server load

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The original implementation was resource-intensive and had poor performance
**Cause**: Based on the context, the previous implementation likely:
- Made separate requests for each post's view count
- Created excessive load on both client devices and servers
- Lacked efficient data batching mechanisms

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: All My Sites mode potentially making too many API requests for view counts across multiple sites
**Cause**: The system needs to fetch view data for posts across multiple sites, which could multiply the performance issues if not properly optimized for batch requests

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the removal of a desired feature (view counts in Blog Posts list) due to performance concerns. The main causes stem from an inefficient implementation that likely made too many individual requests instead of batching them. The team is working on a new solution that includes:
1. A new post-views endpoint for batch requesting view counts
2. Optimization for handling multiple sites
3. Implementation of "Recent Views" with proper linking to detailed stats
4. Better performance considerations for both client and server resources

The acceptance criteria and tasks show they're addressing these issues through a more efficient API endpoint design and improved frontend implementation.
