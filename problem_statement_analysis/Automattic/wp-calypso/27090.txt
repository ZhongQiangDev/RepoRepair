### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The view counts are missing from the Blog Posts list.
**Cause**: The original implementation of displaying view counts was resource-intensive, leading to performance issues for both customers' devices and servers. This necessitated the removal of the feature to improve overall performance.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation does not meet the customer's expectations for viewing post view counts.
**Cause**: The previous design did not provide an efficient way to fetch and display view counts for multiple posts, especially in scenarios where a customer has multiple sites. This led to an unacceptable number of requests being made, impacting performance.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Blog Posts list does not display view counts in "All My Sites" mode.
**Cause**: The existing endpoint and data fetching mechanism were not optimized to handle the aggregation of view counts across multiple sites efficiently. This resulted in either missing view counts or excessive resource usage.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the resource-intensive nature of the original view count implementation, leading to its removal. The subsequent attempts to reintroduce the feature faced challenges in efficiently fetching and displaying view counts, particularly in scenarios involving multiple sites. The root causes include performance constraints, inefficient data fetching mechanisms, and the need for a scalable solution that balances customer expectations with system performance. The team is exploring a less resource-intensive implementation to address these issues while ensuring an acceptable user experience.
