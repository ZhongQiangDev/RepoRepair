Let me analyze the UI issue shown in the screenshot.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The address loading indicator (shown as gray placeholder bars) is positioned too close to the "Weight unit" and "Dimension unit" input fields, creating a cluttered and visually uncomfortable layout.
**Cause**: Missing or insufficient margin/padding CSS properties between the address loading placeholder section and the unit input fields section.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The overall spacing in the shipping form appears inconsistent, with some elements too tightly packed together while others have appropriate spacing.
**Cause**: Inconsistent application of spacing guidelines in the CSS styling, particularly in the vertical spacing between form sections.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around improper spacing in the shipping page layout, specifically between the address loading indicator and the unit input fields. This is primarily a CSS styling problem that can be resolved by:
1. Adding appropriate margin or padding between the address loading section and the unit inputs section
2. Ensuring consistent spacing throughout the form to maintain visual hierarchy and improve readability

The fix would likely involve adding CSS properties like margin-bottom to the address loading indicator container or margin-top to the unit inputs container to create the desired visual separation between these elements.
