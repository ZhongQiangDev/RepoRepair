Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Monthly Jetpack plans showing error-like warnings about expiration, causing unnecessary user anxiety
**Cause**: The system is treating normal monthly renewal cycles as potential error conditions, displaying them with high-severity warning indicators when they are actually expected behavior

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Misleading or inappropriate message content about plan expiration
**Cause**: The messaging system doesn't distinguish between true problematic expirations and normal monthly billing cycles, leading to overly alarming communication

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect handling of credit-based purchases
**Cause**: The system may be generating these warnings specifically because the purchase was made using credits, which cannot auto-renew, but the messaging doesn't properly reflect this specific situation

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of contextual messaging for different payment scenarios
**Cause**: The notification system doesn't adapt its messaging based on the payment method or billing context (e.g., credit-based purchases vs. regular payment methods)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from an oversensitive warning system that doesn't properly differentiate between normal monthly billing cycles and actual problematic situations. This is compounded by non-contextual messaging that fails to account for different payment scenarios (especially credit-based purchases) and creates unnecessary user anxiety. The system needs to be refined to provide more appropriate severity levels for notifications and context-aware messaging based on the specific payment situation.
