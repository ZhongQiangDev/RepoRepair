### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Jetpack monthly plans are showing an error message indicating they will expire in a month, which is causing unnecessary anxiety for users.
**Cause**: The error message is likely triggered because the user is using credits for the purchase, which prevents the plan from auto-renewing. The system is not properly distinguishing between a normal expiration notice and a genuine error.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The severity of the notice is too high, using a red warning icon and alarming language that suggests a critical issue.
**Cause**: The current design of the notification does not take into account the context of the user's payment method. If the user is using credits, the system should display a less severe message that explains the situation more clearly and calmly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The message suggests adding a credit card for auto-renewal, which may not be applicable or desired by all users.
**Cause**: The system lacks flexibility in handling different payment methods and user preferences. Not all users may want or need auto-renewal, and the message should be more tailored to the user's specific situation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are the misleading error message, the overly severe notification design, and the lack of context regarding payment methods. The system should be updated to recognize when a user is using credits and adjust the message accordingly, reducing the severity of the notice and providing more relevant information about payment options. This will help alleviate user anxiety and provide a better overall experience.
