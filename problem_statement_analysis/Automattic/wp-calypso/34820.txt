Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Blank screen appears after selecting "Online Store" segment instead of the Domain Search page
**Cause**: Based on the error screenshots, there appears to be a JavaScript error related to "Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined" in the signup flow. This suggests the code is trying to manipulate a URL or string that hasn't been properly initialized.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Application state inconsistency in incognito mode
**Cause**: The issue specifically occurs in incognito mode, which suggests there might be dependencies on browser storage or cookies that aren't properly handled when browser privacy settings are restricted.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Error in handling route transitions
**Cause**: The screenshots show errors in "signup/steps/site-type" and "signup/steps/site-topic", indicating the routing logic between signup steps is failing to properly manage the transition between these states.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Temporary/intermittent nature of the issue
**Cause**: The fact that refreshing fixes the problem suggests there might be a race condition or timing issue in loading required resources or initializing components, rather than a permanent failure.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be a combination of JavaScript errors in the signup flow, particularly affecting route handling and state management. The problem is more pronounced in incognito mode, suggesting browser storage dependencies. The errors occur during the transition between signup steps, specifically after selecting "Online Store". The intermittent nature and resolution through refresh points to potential race conditions in resource loading or component initialization. The core issue seems to stem from undefined properties being accessed during the URL manipulation process in the signup flow.
