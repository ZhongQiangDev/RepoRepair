### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The user is presented with a blank screen after selecting "Online Store".
**Cause**: The JavaScript console shows an error message indicating that the application failed to fetch the user from the `/me` endpoint due to an `AuthorizationRequiredError`. This suggests that the application is unable to authenticate the user, possibly because an active access token is missing or invalid. This could be due to a session issue, a problem with the authentication flow, or a bug in the application's handling of user sessions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The application does not redirect the user to the Domain Search page as expected.
**Cause**: The failure to authenticate the user likely prevents the application from proceeding to the next step in the onboarding process. Without a valid user session, the application may not have the necessary information to render the Domain Search page, resulting in a blank screen.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue occurs specifically in an Incognito window.
**Cause**: Incognito windows do not retain cookies or session data from previous browsing sessions. This could mean that the application is unable to retrieve any stored session information, leading to the authentication failure. Additionally, if the application relies on certain browser settings or extensions that are not available in Incognito mode, this could also contribute to the problem.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue appears to be an authentication failure due to a missing or invalid access token, which prevents the application from fetching the user's information and proceeding to the Domain Search page. This issue is exacerbated in Incognito mode, where session data is not retained. To resolve this, the application should ensure that it can properly authenticate users even in environments where session data is not stored, such as Incognito windows. This may involve improving the application's handling of user sessions or providing alternative authentication mechanisms.
