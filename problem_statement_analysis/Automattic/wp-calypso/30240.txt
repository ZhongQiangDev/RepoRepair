### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The input fields across different steps of the signup process have inconsistent widths.
**Cause**: The CSS styles applied to the input fields are not uniform. Each input field might have its own specific width defined, or it might be inheriting different styles from various CSS classes or parent elements.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `site-topic` input field has a different width compared to other input fields.
**Cause**: The `site-topic` input field might have a specific CSS class or inline style that sets its width differently from the other input fields. This could be due to a deliberate design choice that was not updated when the other fields were created or modified.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The inconsistency in input field widths affects the visual alignment and user experience.
**Cause**: The lack of a standardized CSS class or style rule for all input fields leads to a disjointed appearance. Users may find it confusing or unprofessional if the input fields do not appear uniform, which can impact their trust and engagement with the signup process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inconsistency in the widths of the input fields across different steps of the signup process. This is caused by non-uniform CSS styling, where each input field may have its own specific width settings. Standardizing the CSS styles to ensure all input fields have the same max-width as the `site-topic` input field will improve visual alignment and enhance the user experience. This can be achieved by creating a common CSS class for all input fields and applying the desired max-width to that class.
