### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The nudge to download the mobile app was removed from the Checklist.
**Cause**: The nudge was considered less relevant as a site setup task and more appropriate as a post-launch onboarding nudge. This decision was made to align with the user's journey and ensure the nudge is more contextually relevant after the site is launched.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The current "congratulations" screen does not include the app nudge.
**Cause**: The recent changes to the Checklist did not update the "congratulations" screen to include the app nudge. This oversight resulted in missing an opportunity to prompt users to download the app at a relevant moment in their setup process.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The mock uses the view from `/me/get-apps` as a nudge for both desktop and mobile apps.
**Cause**: The `/me/get-apps` view may not be optimized for the "congratulations" screen context. The design and content from this view might need adjustments to better fit the flow and purpose of the "congratulations" screen, ensuring it effectively communicates the app nudge.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the removal of the app nudge from the Checklist, the absence of the nudge on the "congratulations" screen, and the potential misalignment of the `/me/get-apps` view with the "congratulations" screen context. These issues stem from a shift in the perceived relevance of the nudge during site setup, an oversight in updating the "congratulations" screen, and the need for design adjustments to ensure the nudge is effectively communicated. Addressing these causes will help reintegrate the app nudge in a way that enhances user onboarding and app adoption.
