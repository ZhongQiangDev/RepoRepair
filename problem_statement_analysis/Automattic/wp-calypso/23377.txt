Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Immediate restore prompt appears after trashing
**Cause**: The editor likely maintains an active editing session state even after the trash action is initiated, causing a conflict between the trashing process and the editor's expectation of an editable post. When the post is trashed, the editor detects the post is no longer available and triggers the restore prompt instead of properly handling the trash completion.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: User remains in the editor interface after trashing
**Cause**: There appears to be no proper redirect logic implemented after the trash action completes. The system should navigate the user away from the editor (perhaps to the posts list) since editing a trashed post is not possible.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing success message and undo option
**Cause**: The UI feedback system isn't properly implemented for the trash action. Instead of showing a confirmation of successful trashing with an undo option, it immediately jumps to a restore prompt, suggesting a gap in the user feedback implementation.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent state between action and response
**Cause**: There's a state management issue where the system doesn't properly handle the transition between the "Trashing..." state and the final trashed state. The UI shows "Trashing..." but then contradicts the user's intended action by prompting for restoration.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from poor state management and user flow implementation in the editor. The system fails to:
1. Properly handle the post-trash state transition
2. Provide appropriate user feedback
3. Implement correct navigation after trashing
4. Maintain consistent state between user actions and system responses

These issues appear to be related to both frontend UI logic and the way the editor handles post state changes, suggesting a need for better coordination between the trashing action and editor state management.
