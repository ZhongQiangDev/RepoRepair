### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Only an Administrator can purchase a plan, and once purchased, the ownership cannot be transferred to another Administrator.
**Cause**: The current system design restricts plan ownership to the initial purchaser and does not provide a mechanism for transferring ownership to other Administrators on the site.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Owner box is not clickable for transferring ownership.
**Cause**: The interface does not support the functionality to change the owner of a plan. There is no interactive element or flow designed for transferring ownership.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no warning or confirmation process for transferring ownership.
**Cause**: The system lacks a user interface that informs the current owner about the implications of transferring ownership, such as losing the ability to manage or cancel the plan, and the transfer of billing details.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: No notification is sent to the current and new owner after transferring ownership.
**Cause**: The system does not have a built-in feature to send emails or notifications to both the current and new owner, informing them about the ownership transfer.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no entry in the Activity Log for ownership transfers.
**Cause**: The system does not log the transfer of plan ownership, making it difficult to track changes and maintain an audit trail.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The current system restricts plan ownership to the initial purchaser and lacks the necessary features for transferring ownership to other Administrators. The interface does not support this functionality, and there are no warnings, notifications, or logs to inform users about the implications and track changes. To address these issues, the system needs to be updated to include a clickable Owner box, a confirmation process, email notifications, and an entry in the Activity Log for ownership transfers.
