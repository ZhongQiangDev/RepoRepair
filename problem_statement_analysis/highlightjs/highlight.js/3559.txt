Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent bracket coloring in Kotlin inheritance syntax where some brackets are highlighted differently than others in the same context
**Cause**: This appears to be a syntax highlighting issue in the code editor's (VSCode and JSFiddle) Kotlin language parser. The parser may be incorrectly interpreting some brackets as part of different syntactic contexts despite them all being used for class inheritance.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue specifically occurs in class inheritance declarations (after the colon symbol)
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter might be treating the brackets after inheritance declarations (`:`) differently from regular code blocks, possibly confusing them with type parameters or other Kotlin syntax constructs.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is reproducible across different platforms (VSCode markdown preview and JSFiddle)
**Cause**: This suggests the problem lies in the common syntax highlighting libraries or Kotlin language definitions used by these platforms, rather than being platform-specific. Many editors use TextMate grammars or similar syntax highlighting engines, which might have incorrect rules for Kotlin inheritance contexts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is a syntax highlighting inconsistency in how brackets are colored in Kotlin code, specifically in class inheritance contexts. This appears to be a problem with the syntax highlighting engines used across different platforms (VSCode and JSFiddle) rather than a Kotlin language issue itself. The root cause likely stems from incorrect or incomplete syntax highlighting rules in the common language parsing libraries used by these editors, particularly in how they handle brackets following inheritance declarations.
