### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The opening and closing brackets in the class inheritance context are highlighted with different colors.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting engine used in the markdown preview and JSFiddle is not correctly identifying the scope of the brackets in the context of class inheritance. This could be due to a bug in the syntax highlighting rules for Kotlin, where the engine is not properly recognizing the nested structure of the classes and their methods.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is for all brackets to be highlighted with the same color, but they are not.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to the specific implementation of the syntax highlighting library being used. The library may not be fully compatible with Kotlin's syntax, especially in cases where classes are defined with methods that include lambda expressions. This incompatibility can lead to incorrect highlighting of the brackets.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the syntax highlighting engine is not correctly identifying the scope of the brackets in the context of class inheritance in Kotlin. This could be due to a bug in the syntax highlighting rules or an incompatibility with the specific implementation of the syntax highlighting library. To resolve this, the syntax highlighting rules for Kotlin need to be updated or the library needs to be adjusted to correctly recognize the nested structure of the classes and their methods.
