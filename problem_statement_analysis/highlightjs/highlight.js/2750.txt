I'll analyze the GitHub issue following the requested format:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighter incorrectly interprets right curly braces `}` inside template literal expressions as the end of the template expression
**Cause**: The highlighter's parser appears to be looking for a simple `}` character to mark the end of template expressions, without properly accounting for nested structures like objects or blocks within the expression

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Text after a right curly brace within a template expression is incorrectly highlighted as a string
**Cause**: Once the highlighter mistakenly identifies a `}` as the end of the template expression, it reverts to treating the remaining content as part of the template literal string rather than continuing to parse it as part of the expression

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Nested template literals within expressions are incorrectly treated as terminators for the parent template literal
**Cause**: The highlighter's parsing logic doesn't properly handle nested template literals within expressions, causing it to confuse nested template literal syntax with the parent template literal's boundaries

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Styled Components syntax (a common CSS-in-JS pattern) is particularly affected due to its heavy use of template literals with functions
**Cause**: The highlighter's current implementation doesn't properly support complex use cases where template literals contain arrow functions, object destructuring, and nested template literals - all common patterns in Styled Components

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the highlighter's simplistic parsing of template literal expressions, where it fails to properly track nested structures (objects, functions, and nested template literals). This particularly affects modern JavaScript patterns like Styled Components. The highlighter needs to implement more sophisticated parsing that can properly track nested scopes and structures within template literal expressions, similar to how VS Code's highlighter handles these cases correctly.
