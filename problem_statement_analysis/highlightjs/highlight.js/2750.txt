### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighter incorrectly treats the right curly brace inside a template literal expression as the end of the expression, causing the rest of the expression to be highlighted as a string.
**Cause**: The highlighter's parsing logic is not sophisticated enough to handle nested curly braces within template literal expressions. It prematurely ends the expression when it encounters the first right curly brace, failing to recognize that it might be part of a nested object or function.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: When a nested template literal is used within the expression, the highlighter treats it as the terminator for the parent template literal.
**Cause**: The highlighter lacks the ability to properly track and differentiate between nested template literals and their parent template literals. This results in the nested template literal being incorrectly interpreted as the end of the parent template literal, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from the highlighter's inability to accurately parse and differentiate between nested curly braces and template literals within template literal expressions. This limitation causes premature termination of expressions and incorrect interpretation of nested structures, leading to improper highlighting. To resolve these issues, the highlighter's parsing logic needs to be enhanced to correctly handle nested curly braces and template literals within template literal expressions.
