### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In Scala, comments after the class declaration are incorrectly rendered as class titles.
**Cause**: The issue arises from the way `highlight.js` processes the code. When the curly brace `{` is on a new line, `highlight.js` misinterprets the comment as part of the class title. This is likely due to the regex patterns used by `highlight.js` for identifying class declarations and comments. The version `9.12.0` of `highlight.js` may not have the necessary updates to handle this specific edge case correctly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: In JavaScript, comments inside function parameters are not highlighted.
**Cause**: The `highlight.js` library does not properly recognize comments within function parameters. This is likely due to the grammar rules defined for JavaScript in `highlight.js`. The library may not have rules that specifically account for comments within the parameter list of a function, leading to the comments being ignored during the highlighting process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: Both issues stem from limitations in the `highlight.js` library's ability to correctly parse and highlight specific code structures. In the Scala case, the library misinterprets comments as part of the class title when the curly brace is on a new line. In the JavaScript case, the library fails to recognize comments within function parameters. Updating to a newer version of `highlight.js` or customizing the grammar rules may resolve these issues.
