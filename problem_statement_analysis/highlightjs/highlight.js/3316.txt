### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting of primitive types (`int`, `char`, etc.) as separate entities from keywords makes the code look unnatural and confusing.
**Cause**: In the recent update (hljs 11.0.0), primitive types were moved from `RESERVED_TYPES` to `RESERVED_KEYWORDS`, causing them to be highlighted differently from other keywords. This change deviates from the standard practice in popular C++ IDEs and text editors, where primitive types are typically highlighted as keywords.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The separation of primitive types from keywords disrupts the visual consistency expected by C++ developers.
**Cause**: The C++ standard treats primitive types as keywords. By splitting them into separate categories for highlighting, the update introduces a visual inconsistency that can lead to confusion, especially for developers accustomed to seeing primitive types highlighted as keywords.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the unnatural and confusing highlighting of primitive types as separate entities from keywords. This is caused by the recent update that moved primitive types from `RESERVED_TYPES` to `RESERVED_KEYWORDS`, leading to a visual inconsistency with standard practices in popular C++ IDEs and text editors. Returning to the previous behavior, where primitive types are highlighted as keywords, would restore visual consistency and align with the C++ standard and developer expectations.
