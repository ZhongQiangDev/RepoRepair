### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Member functions in ES6 classes are not highlighted.
**Cause**: The `highlightAuto` method of highlight.js might not be correctly identifying the language or the specific syntax of ES6 classes. This could be due to the fact that `highlightAuto` tries to guess the language based on the code snippet, and it might not be recognizing the ES6 class syntax properly. Additionally, the version of highlight.js being used might not have the necessary language definitions for ES6 classes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The rendered output does not display the expected syntax highlighting for functions.
**Cause**: The `marked` library might not be properly integrating with highlight.js. The `highlight` option in `marked.setOptions` might not be correctly configured to handle the ES6 class syntax. This could be due to a mismatch in the way `marked` and highlight.js process the code, or an issue with the way the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is being used to render the highlighted code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the configuration and integration of highlight.js with the `marked` library for ES6 class syntax highlighting. The `highlightAuto` method might not be recognizing the ES6 class syntax correctly, and there could be a mismatch in how `marked` and highlight.js process the code. To resolve these issues, you could try specifying the language explicitly in the `highlight` option, updating to a newer version of highlight.js that supports ES6 classes, or using a different method for syntax highlighting that is more compatible with ES6 class syntax. Additionally, ensure that the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is being used correctly to render the highlighted code.
