Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Member functions (like constructor and render) in ES6 classes are not being syntax highlighted by highlight.js
**Cause**: By default, highlight.js's auto-detection might not properly recognize ES6 class syntax or might be using an older JavaScript language definition that doesn't fully support ES6 class features.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting configuration is using auto-detection (highlightAuto) instead of explicitly specifying the language
**Cause**: Using `hljs.highlightAuto()` makes highlight.js guess the language, which can be less reliable than explicitly specifying JavaScript as the language using `hljs.highlight(code, {language: 'javascript'})`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The code might be using an outdated version of highlight.js
**Cause**: Older versions of highlight.js might not have full support for ES6 class syntax highlighting. The version being used needs to be checked and potentially updated to a newer version that better supports modern JavaScript features.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting styles might not be properly imported or applied
**Cause**: The CSS styles for highlight.js need to be properly imported into the React application. Without the correct style definitions, even if the syntax is properly detected, it won't be visually highlighted.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around highlight.js configuration and setup. The problems stem from using auto-detection instead of explicit language specification, potentially outdated highlight.js version, and possible missing or incorrect style imports. To fix these issues, the code should:
1. Explicitly specify JavaScript as the language
2. Update to the latest highlight.js version
3. Ensure proper style imports
4. Verify that the ES6 language definition is included in the highlight.js build
