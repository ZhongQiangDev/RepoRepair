### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Comments following `` `define`` are not highlighted correctly.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the Verilog language definition in highlight.js treats everything from a backquote (`` ` ``) to the end of the line as `meta` scope. This means that the comment following `` `define`` is incorrectly classified as `meta` instead of being recognized as a comment.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Text following a backquote (`` ` ``) when using defined values is not highlighted correctly.
**Cause**: Similar to the previous issue, the current implementation of the Verilog language definition in highlight.js treats everything from a backquote (`` ` ``) to the end of the line as `meta` scope. This means that when a defined value is used (e.g., `` `CONSTANT``), the text following it is incorrectly classified as `meta` instead of being recognized as part of the expression or comment.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the current implementation of the Verilog language definition in highlight.js incorrectly classifies everything from a backquote (`` ` ``) to the end of the line as `meta` scope. This results in comments following `` `define`` and text following defined values not being highlighted correctly. To fix this, the language definition needs to be updated to correctly recognize comments and expressions following backquotes.
