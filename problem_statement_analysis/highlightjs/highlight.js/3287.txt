Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Comments after `define directives are not highlighted correctly as comments
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is treating everything after the backquote (`) as meta scope until the end of line, instead of properly recognizing the comment delimiter (//) and applying comment highlighting

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Text following backquotes (`) in regular code (like `CONSTANT) is not properly syntax highlighted
**Cause**: The highlighter is incorrectly extending the meta scope treatment to all backquote usage, when in Verilog backquotes are also used as a prefix for accessing defined constants/macros. The text after backquotes should be highlighted as variables/constants.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The overall syntax highlighting differs significantly from similar languages like C
**Cause**: The Verilog language definition in highlight.js appears to have an overly broad rule for backquote handling that doesn't properly account for Verilog's specific usage patterns of backquotes in both preprocessor directives and constant references

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from highlight.js's Verilog language definition treating backquotes (`) too broadly as meta scope markers. This causes three main problems: incorrect comment highlighting in define directives, improper highlighting of constant references, and overall inconsistent highlighting compared to similar languages. The language definition needs to be updated to:
1. Properly handle comments after preprocessor directives
2. Correctly scope backquoted constant references
3. Align more closely with established syntax highlighting patterns from similar languages like C

The fix would likely involve modifying the meta scope rules to be more specific to preprocessor directives while allowing proper highlighting of backquoted constants and subsequent code.
