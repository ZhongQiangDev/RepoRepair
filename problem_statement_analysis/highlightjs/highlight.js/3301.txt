Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: CSS inline comments (/* ... */) are not being highlighted with the proper color/styling in version 10.6.0 and later
**Cause**: The regression appears to be related to the transition from `initHighlighting` API to the new `highlightAll` API in version 10.6.0, suggesting the new API may have introduced changes in how comment tokens are processed or styled in the CSS language definition

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment highlighting appears as plain text instead of having the expected comment styling
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting engine may not be properly identifying and classifying the inline comment tokens when using the new `highlightAll` API, failing to apply the appropriate CSS class for comments

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The regression only affects CSS language highlighting while using the new API
**Cause**: The issue seems specific to how the CSS language definition interacts with the new highlighting API, indicating potential compatibility issues or missing token handling in the updated implementation

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is a regression in CSS inline comment highlighting that occurred when transitioning from version 10.5.0 to 10.6.0. The problem manifests as inline comments losing their proper highlighting and appearing as plain text. The root cause appears to be related to changes in how the new `highlightAll` API handles comment token identification and styling specifically for the CSS language definition. This suggests either a bug in the new API implementation or incomplete adaptation of the CSS language definition to work with the new API's token processing mechanism.
