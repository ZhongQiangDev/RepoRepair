### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inline comments within CSS properties are not highlighted correctly in version 10.6.0 and later.
**Cause**: The `highlightAll` API introduced in version 10.6.0 may have altered the way inline comments are parsed and highlighted. This could be due to changes in the regular expressions or parsing logic used to identify and highlight inline comments.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of highlighting inline comments as seen in version 10.5.0 is not maintained in version 11.1.0.
**Cause**: The transition from `initHighlighting` to `highlightAll` might have introduced a regression. The `initHighlighting` method in version 10.5.0 could have had a more accurate or specific handling of inline comments, which was not carried over or was altered in the `highlightAll` implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The color or style of the inline comment is not distinct from the surrounding code.
**Cause**: The CSS rules applied to inline comments may have been changed or not properly applied in the newer versions. This could be due to changes in the CSS classes or styles associated with inline comments in the updated version of the library.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect highlighting of inline comments in CSS when using the `highlightAll` API in versions 10.6.0 and later. This is likely due to changes in the parsing logic and the transition from `initHighlighting` to `highlightAll`. Additionally, the CSS styles for inline comments may not have been properly updated or applied in the newer versions, leading to a lack of distinction between inline comments and the surrounding code. To resolve this, the parsing logic for inline comments should be reviewed and adjusted, and the CSS styles for inline comments should be ensured to be correctly applied.
