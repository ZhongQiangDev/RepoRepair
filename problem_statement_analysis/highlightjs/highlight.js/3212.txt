Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Single `0` is not highlighted as a number
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules likely don't recognize a standalone `0` as a valid numeric token. The pattern matching for numbers might be expecting either non-zero digits or multiple digits.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Numbers starting with `0` (like `0123`) are not highlighted at all
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter's pattern for integers might be too restrictive, not allowing leading zeros. This could be because in some languages leading zeros indicate octal numbers, but in Elixir they are valid decimal integers.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: In floating-point numbers starting with `0` (like `0.3`), only the decimal part is highlighted
**Cause**: The number recognition pattern appears to be broken into parts, where it's failing to recognize the `0` before the decimal point as part of the number. The pattern might be incorrectly treating the leading `0` and decimal point separately from the rest of the number.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete or incorrect number pattern matching in the syntax highlighter for Elixir code. There are three main manifestations: standalone zero not being recognized, leading zeros in integers being ignored, and partial highlighting of floating-point numbers starting with zero. All these issues appear to be related to how the highlighter handles the digit `0` in various numeric contexts. The solution would likely involve updating the regular expressions or pattern matching rules in the syntax highlighter to properly handle all valid Elixir number formats, especially those involving leading or standalone zeros.
