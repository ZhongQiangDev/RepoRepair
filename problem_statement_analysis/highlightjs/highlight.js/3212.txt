### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: `0` on its own is not highlighted as a number.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules for the Elixir language in the code editor or library being used may not be correctly identifying `0` as a standalone number. This could be due to a missing or incorrect regular expression pattern that matches `0` as a valid number.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: `0` at the start of a decimal integer (e.g., `0123`) is not highlighted as a number.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules may be treating numbers starting with `0` as octal numbers or as invalid numbers, and thus not highlighting them. This could be due to a rule that expects numbers to start with a non-zero digit or a specific pattern that does not match numbers starting with `0`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: In a float number starting with `0` (e.g., `0.3`), only the part after the decimal point (`3`) is highlighted as a number.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules may be splitting the float number into two parts: the integer part (`0`) and the fractional part (`3`). The integer part (`0`) might not be recognized as a valid number on its own, leading to only the fractional part being highlighted.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from the syntax highlighting rules not correctly identifying `0` as a valid number in various contexts. This could be due to missing or incorrect regular expression patterns for matching numbers, particularly those starting with `0`. Adjusting the syntax highlighting rules to properly recognize `0` as a standalone number and as part of decimal integers and floats should resolve these issues.
