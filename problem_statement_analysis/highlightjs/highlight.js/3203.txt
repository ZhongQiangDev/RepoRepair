Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Double hyphen flags (--flag) are not being highlighted in the syntax highlighting, while single hyphen flags (-flag) are highlighted correctly
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter's PowerShell grammar rules likely only include patterns for single hyphen flags but not double hyphen flags, despite both being valid in PowerShell Core

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between syntax highlighting and actual PowerShell behavior
**Cause**: While PowerShell traditionally used single hyphen flags, PowerShell Core (version 7+) supports both single and double hyphen flags. The syntax highlighter appears to be based on older PowerShell conventions and hasn't been updated to reflect modern PowerShell Core capabilities.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential confusion for users writing PowerShell scripts
**Cause**: The incorrect highlighting might lead developers to think double hyphen flags are invalid in PowerShell, when they are actually supported in PowerShell Core, creating a misleading development experience

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from outdated syntax highlighting rules that don't reflect modern PowerShell Core's support for both single (-) and double (--) hyphen flags. This creates a disconnect between the editor's visual feedback and the actual language capabilities, potentially causing confusion for developers. The highlighter needs to be updated to recognize both flag formats as valid PowerShell syntax, aligning with PowerShell Core's current specifications.
