### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The double flag (`--flag`) is not highlighted correctly in the code snippet.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the syntax highlighting library used in the environment where the code is displayed. The library may not be configured to recognize double hyphens (`--`) as valid flag indicators in PowerShell, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is for both single (`-flag`) and double (`--flag`) flags to be highlighted correctly, as seen in PowerShell Core 7.1.3.
**Cause**: The discrepancy could be due to differences in the syntax highlighting rules between the environment where the issue is observed and PowerShell Core 7.1.3. The environment might be using an outdated or incomplete set of rules for PowerShell syntax highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the double flag (`--flag`) is not highlighted correctly in the observed environment. This is likely due to the syntax highlighting library not being properly configured to recognize double hyphens as valid flag indicators in PowerShell. The expected behavior, where both single and double flags are highlighted correctly, is seen in PowerShell Core 7.1.3, indicating that the highlighting rules in the observed environment need to be updated or corrected to match the behavior in PowerShell Core 7.1.3.
