### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting breaks after a string escape sequence in the dynamic SQL.
**Cause**: The `highlight.js` library is not correctly interpreting the escape sequences within the string literals. Specifically, the nested single quotes (`''`) used for escaping single quotes within the string are causing the syntax highlighting to break. The library may be misinterpreting these escape sequences as the end of the string literal, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting does not match the expected behavior seen on GitHub.
**Cause**: The version of `highlight.js` being used in the CodePen example may not be up-to-date or may not have the necessary language definitions for T-SQL that GitHub uses. GitHub might be using a more advanced or customized version of `highlight.js` that better handles T-SQL syntax, including escape sequences.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting is inconsistent between "sql" and "tsql" language settings.
**Cause**: The `highlight.js` library may have different language definitions for "sql" and "tsql", but both definitions may not be fully optimized for handling T-SQL-specific syntax like dynamic SQL and escape sequences. This can lead to inconsistent highlighting behavior depending on which language setting is used.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that `highlight.js` is not correctly interpreting escape sequences within string literals in T-SQL, leading to broken syntax highlighting. This is likely due to limitations in the language definitions used by `highlight.js` for SQL and T-SQL. Updating to a newer version of `highlight.js` or using a more customized language definition that better handles T-SQL syntax could resolve the issue. Additionally, ensuring consistency between "sql" and "tsql" language settings would help in providing a more accurate and reliable highlighting experience.
