Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting incorrectly handles the trailing escaped backslash (`\\`) at the end of a line in properties files.
**Cause**: The highlighter appears to be interpreting the double backslash (`\\`) as a line continuation character instead of treating it as an escaped backslash literal. This is particularly problematic for Windows file paths where backslashes need to be escaped.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting differs from standard properties file behavior where escaped backslashes should be treated as literal characters.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules likely don't have a specific pattern to distinguish between a line continuation backslash (`\` followed by newline) and an escaped backslash (`\\`) at the end of a line.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual inconsistency between the actual properties file specification and the highlighted output.
**Cause**: The highlighter's parsing logic seems to prioritize the line continuation rule over the escape sequence rule when encountering backslashes at the end of lines, leading to incorrect visual representation of valid properties file syntax.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the syntax highlighter's inability to properly distinguish between line continuation backslashes and escaped backslash literals at the end of lines. This creates particular problems with Windows file paths and any other scenarios where escaped backslashes are needed as actual values. The highlighter needs to be updated to:
1. Correctly recognize escaped backslashes (`\\`) as literal characters
2. Only treat single backslashes followed by newlines (`\` + newline) as line continuation markers
3. Maintain proper highlighting consistency with the properties file specification
