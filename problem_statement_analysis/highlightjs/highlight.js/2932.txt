### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `b` attribute is not correctly recognized as a multi-line value when it ends with an escaped backslash (`\\`).
**Cause**: The current implementation of the `highlight` function does not properly handle the case where a line ends with an escaped backslash. It treats the backslash as an escape character for the newline, but it should recognize that the backslash is escaped and should not escape the newline.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `b` attribute is incorrectly highlighted as a single-line value, causing the `c` attribute to be incorrectly parsed.
**Cause**: The parser does not correctly identify the end of the multi-line value for `b` when it encounters the escaped backslash. As a result, it incorrectly treats the next line as part of the `b` value, leading to the `c` attribute being incorrectly parsed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `highlight` function does not correctly handle the case where a line ends with an escaped backslash. This causes the `b` attribute to be incorrectly recognized as a single-line value, leading to incorrect parsing of subsequent lines. To fix this issue, the parser needs to be updated to correctly handle escaped backslashes at the end of lines.
