### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Multi-line comments in CMake are not being properly recognized and highlighted as comments. Instead, they are being treated as regular code.
**Cause**: The `highlight.js` library is not correctly configured to recognize CMake's multi-line comment syntax (`#[[ ... ]]`). It seems to only recognize single-line comments that start with `#`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The sample code provided does not display the expected behavior where the multi-line comment is grayed out.
**Cause**: The `highlight.js` library version being used (11.6.0) may not have the necessary language definition for CMake's multi-line comments. The library might need an update or a custom language definition to properly handle CMake's multi-line comment syntax.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that `highlight.js` does not properly recognize CMake's multi-line comment syntax. This can be caused by either the library not being configured correctly or the library version not supporting the necessary language definition. To fix this, either an update to the library or a custom language definition may be needed.
