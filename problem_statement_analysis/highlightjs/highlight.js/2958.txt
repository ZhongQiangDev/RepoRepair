### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The single-letter namespace prefix (`a:FAIL`) is not highlighted.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting library used (highlight.js) may have a specific rule or limitation that prevents it from recognizing single-letter namespace prefixes as valid XML elements. This could be due to a change in the library's parsing logic introduced in version 10.4.0, which might not handle single-letter prefixes correctly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `<a:FAIL>` element does not get highlighted, but its child element `<ImOkAgain>` does.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to how the library processes nested elements with single-letter namespace prefixes. The parent element `<a:FAIL>` might be incorrectly identified as invalid, causing the highlighting to fail, while the child element `<ImOkAgain>`, which does not use a single-letter prefix, is correctly highlighted.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem is reproducible on both Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow.
**Cause**: Both platforms use the same version of the syntax highlighting library (highlight.js), which has the same limitation or bug affecting the handling of single-letter namespace prefixes. This indicates that the issue is inherent to the library rather than a platform-specific configuration.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the syntax highlighting library (highlight.js) does not correctly handle single-letter namespace prefixes, leading to a lack of highlighting for elements using such prefixes. This behavior was introduced in version 10.4.0 and affects both parent and child elements in XML code. The problem is consistent across platforms that use the same version of the library, indicating a need for a fix within the library itself to properly recognize and highlight single-letter namespace prefixes.
