### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code highlighting is not working correctly after an empty block comment (`/**/`). The code following the empty block comment is not being highlighted as expected.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the way the Dart syntax highlighting parser handles empty block comments. When it encounters an empty block comment, it may not properly reset its state, causing it to fail to recognize the subsequent code as valid Dart syntax.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The entire code block is displayed in a single color, without any syntax highlighting.
**Cause**: The Dart syntax highlighting parser might be getting confused by the empty block comment, causing it to treat the entire code block as plain text. This could be due to a bug in the parser's state management or a lack of proper handling for empty block comments.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the Dart syntax highlighting parser is not correctly handling empty block comments, leading to a failure in recognizing and highlighting the subsequent code. This results in the entire code block being displayed without any syntax highlighting. To fix this, the parser needs to be updated to properly handle empty block comments and reset its state accordingly.
