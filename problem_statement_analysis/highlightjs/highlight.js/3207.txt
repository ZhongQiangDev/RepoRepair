Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighting breaks after the function capture operator `&` and treats code differently until the next forward slash `/`
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be misinterpreting the forward slash in the function capture syntax (`&function_name/arity`) as a regex delimiter or string delimiter, causing it to treat everything between the slashes as a different context

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The function capture expression `&letter?/1` is not highlighted consistently with the rest of the code
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting rules for Elixir in the highlighter likely don't have proper handling for the function capture syntax pattern (`&name/arity`), which is a special syntax specific to Elixir

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The code after the function capture expression has incorrect highlighting
**Cause**: The highlighter loses its proper context after encountering the unhandled function capture syntax, affecting the tokenization and highlighting of subsequent code until it encounters another delimiter or reaches the end of the block

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of Elixir's function capture syntax (`&function_name/arity`) in the syntax highlighter. The forward slash in this syntax is being misinterpreted as a delimiter, which breaks the highlighting context. This causes three main problems: incorrect highlighting of the function capture itself, treating code between slashes differently, and breaking the highlighting of subsequent code. The fact that the alternative syntax `&letter?(&1)` works correctly suggests that this is specifically related to the `/arity` syntax pattern recognition in the highlighter's rules for Elixir.
