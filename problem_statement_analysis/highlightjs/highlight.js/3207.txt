### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The function capture `&letter?/1` is not highlighted correctly, and the highlighting seems to break after the `/` character, affecting the rest of the code.

**Cause**: The highlighting library is misinterpreting the `/` character in the function capture syntax `&letter?/1`. It appears to treat the `/` as the start of a regular expression or a division operator, which causes the highlighting to break until the next `/` is encountered. This misinterpretation leads to incorrect syntax highlighting for the rest of the code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is for the function capture `&letter?/1` to be highlighted as a single unit, similar to how `&letter?(&1)` is highlighted.

**Cause**: The highlighting library lacks specific rules or patterns to correctly identify and handle the function capture syntax `&function_name/arity`. As a result, it fails to recognize `&letter?/1` as a complete function capture and instead treats it as separate components, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the highlighting library does not correctly interpret the function capture syntax `&function_name/arity` in Elixir. This misinterpretation causes the highlighting to break after the `/` character, affecting the rest of the code. To fix this, the highlighting library needs to be updated with specific rules or patterns to correctly identify and handle the function capture syntax, ensuring that `&letter?/1` is highlighted as a single unit, similar to `&letter?(&1)`.
