Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The C++ code syntax highlighting is not being rendered properly, showing plain text instead of colored syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The highlight.js library is not properly recognizing or processing the C++ code, despite the language being explicitly set to "cpp" in the highlighting configuration

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code formatting appears to be inconsistent between the expected and actual output
**Cause**: The highlight.js version being used might not be compatible with the specific C++ syntax elements being used (like Eigen library syntax), causing the formatter to fail in properly parsing these specialized C++ constructs

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting configuration appears to be simplified or incomplete
**Cause**: The code snippet shows only basic configuration (`language: "cpp", ignoreIllegals: true`) which might be missing additional required options for proper C++ highlighting, especially for advanced C++ features and external library syntax

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The rendered output doesn't match the expected visual style shown in the screenshot
**Cause**: There might be missing CSS styles or theme configurations that are required for proper syntax highlighting rendering

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be a combination of highlight.js configuration and compatibility problems. The syntax highlighter is failing to properly render C++ code, particularly code that includes external library usage (Eigen). The causes range from potential version incompatibility issues, incomplete configuration settings, missing CSS styles, to possible limitations in handling specialized C++ syntax. A proper solution would likely involve ensuring the correct highlight.js version is used, including all necessary configuration options, and verifying that all required CSS styling is properly loaded.
