### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code is not being properly highlighted, and some parts are not rendered correctly.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to the `highlight` function not recognizing the C++ language properly. The `ignoreIllegals` option is set to `true`, which might be causing the highlighter to skip over parts of the code that it considers illegal, leading to incomplete rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior shows a properly highlighted and rendered C++ code, but the actual output does not match this.
**Cause**: The `highlight` function might not be configured correctly for C++ syntax. The language parameter might not be recognized, or there could be an issue with the version of the highlight library being used. Additionally, the code snippet might contain characters or structures that the highlighter does not recognize, causing it to fail to render correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the configuration and recognition of the C++ language by the `highlight` function. The `ignoreIllegals` option might be causing parts of the code to be skipped, and the highlight library might not be properly configured for C++ syntax. To fix these issues, ensure that the language parameter is correctly set, and consider updating the highlight library or adjusting the configuration settings. Additionally, check the code snippet for any characters or structures that might be causing the highlighter to fail.
