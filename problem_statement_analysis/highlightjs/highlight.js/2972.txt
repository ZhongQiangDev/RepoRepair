### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited support for Python Type Hints in `highlight.js`.
**Cause**: The current implementation of `highlight.js` for Python does not fully recognize and highlight type hints as specified in PEP 484. This is evident from the commit mentioned in the issue description, which indicates that the support is minimal and not useful.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting compared to Magic Python.
**Cause**: Magic Python has more advanced and comprehensive support for Python syntax, including type hints, which results in better highlighting. The `highlight.js` library lacks similar advanced features and configurations for handling type hints, leading to a less effective and less visually appealing code presentation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect highlighting of specific Python constructs.
**Cause**: The sample code provided includes constructs like `Dict[int, Any]` and `List[float]`, which should be properly highlighted as type hints. However, `highlight.js` fails to recognize these constructs correctly, leading to improper syntax highlighting. This is likely due to the limited grammar rules and token definitions in the `highlight.js` Python language definition.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the limited support for Python Type Hints in `highlight.js`, which results in inadequate and inconsistent highlighting compared to more advanced libraries like Magic Python. The causes include the minimal implementation of type hint support in `highlight.js`, the lack of advanced features for handling complex Python constructs, and the insufficient grammar rules for recognizing and highlighting type hints properly. To address these issues, `highlight.js` would need to enhance its Python language definition to include comprehensive support for type hints and other advanced Python features.
