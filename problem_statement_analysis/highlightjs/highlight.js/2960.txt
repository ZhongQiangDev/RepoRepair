### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The regex `m(/$)` is not correctly highlighted as a regex pattern.
**Cause**: The current regex parser in Highlight.js does not support Perl's `m` style regex with arbitrary delimiters. It expects a specific format and fails to recognize the unescaped `/` as a valid delimiter.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The regex `qr(/$)` is not correctly highlighted as a regex pattern.
**Cause**: Similar to the `m` style regex, the `qr` operator in Perl also allows for arbitrary delimiters. The Highlight.js parser does not correctly identify this syntax, leading to improper highlighting.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Other regex patterns with different delimiters (e.g., `m|/$|`, `m#/$#`, `m{/$}`) are not correctly highlighted.
**Cause**: The Highlight.js parser is not configured to recognize Perl's flexibility in using different delimiters for regex patterns. It only supports a limited set of delimiters, causing these patterns to be misinterpreted.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Highlight.js's regex parser does not fully support Perl's regex syntax, particularly the use of arbitrary delimiters with the `m` and `qr` operators. This leads to incorrect highlighting of regex patterns in Perl code. To fix this, the parser needs to be updated to recognize and handle Perl's flexible regex syntax correctly.
