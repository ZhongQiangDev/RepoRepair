Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The regex pattern after the `m` operator with alternative delimiters (like parentheses) is not being properly highlighted in the syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter doesn't recognize Perl's alternative delimiter syntax for the match operator `m`. While Perl allows various delimiters like `m(...)`, `m{...}`, `m|...|`, etc., the highlighter seems to only recognize the traditional `/.../ `pattern.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Similar highlighting issues with the `qr` operator when using alternative delimiters
**Cause**: The regex parser in the syntax highlighter doesn't properly handle Perl's Regexp Quote-Like Operators (`qr`) with alternative delimiters. This is related to the first issue but specifically affects the `qr` operator which is used for creating regex objects.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Unescaped forward slashes within regex patterns using alternative delimiters are not properly handled
**Cause**: The highlighter's regex parser appears to be too restrictive in its handling of forward slashes, likely assuming they must be escaped when they appear within patterns, even though Perl allows them to be unescaped when using alternative delimiters.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete implementation of Perl's flexible regex delimiter system in the syntax highlighter. The highlighter needs to be updated to recognize:
1. Alternative delimiters for the `m` operator
2. Alternative delimiters for quote-like operators such as `qr`
3. Proper handling of unescaped forward slashes within patterns using alternative delimiters
These limitations make the current syntax highlighting inconsistent with Perl's actual regex syntax rules.
