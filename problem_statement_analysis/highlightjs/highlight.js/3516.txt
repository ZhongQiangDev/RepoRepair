### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The closing parenthesis `)` within the string is incorrectly highlighted, causing the string to be prematurely terminated.
**Cause**: The `highlight` library version 11.5.0 may not properly handle parentheses within quoted strings. It seems to treat the `)` as a closing delimiter for the `url()` function, rather than recognizing it as part of the string content.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The string content after the `)` is not recognized as part of the same string, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.
**Cause**: The `highlight` library might not be correctly parsing the string delimiters (`'` or `"`). It appears to lose track of the string context when encountering the `)` character, failing to recognize that the string is still open and should continue until the matching closing quote.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue arises from the `highlight` library's inability to properly handle parentheses within quoted strings. The library prematurely terminates the string upon encountering the `)` character, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. This behavior suggests a parsing issue where the library fails to maintain the correct string context when processing characters within quotes. Updating the library or applying a custom parsing rule might resolve the problem.
