### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `MAGIC_COMMENT` rule only highlights the first line containing `TeX` (case-sensitive) and does not highlight the second line containing `TEX` (case-insensitive).

**Cause**: The `MAGIC_COMMENT` rule in the LaTeX language definition is currently case-sensitive. It only matches the exact string `TeX` and does not account for variations like `TEX` or `tex`. This is because the rule does not include a case-insensitive flag or option.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Line 3, which contains a regular comment, is not highlighted correctly as a `COMMENT`.

**Cause**: The current language definition for LaTeX may not have a specific rule to handle regular comments that start with `%` but do not match the `MAGIC_COMMENT` pattern. As a result, this line is not being highlighted as a `COMMENT`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `MAGIC_COMMENT` rule is case-sensitive, which prevents it from correctly highlighting lines with case variations like `TEX`. Additionally, there may be a lack of a specific rule to handle regular comments, leading to incorrect highlighting of line 3. To fix these issues, the `MAGIC_COMMENT` rule should be made case-insensitive, and a rule for regular comments should be added or ensured to be functioning correctly.
