Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting of values in Handlebars templates
**Cause**: The current syntax highlighting rules don't properly distinguish between different types of values (properties, keywords, strings) within Handlebars blocks, leading to inconsistent coloring as shown in the screenshot.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor differentiation between keywords and values
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter doesn't properly identify and separately highlight Handlebars keywords (#if, else if, /if) versus the actual values and properties being referenced (this.userData.isLoaded, etc.).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Glimmer template syntax not properly supported
**Cause**: The issue mentions that Glimmer templates (which extend Handlebars) likely need their own syntax definition, suggesting the current Handlebars highlighting rules don't fully account for Glimmer's extended syntax features.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Highlighting quality inferior to GitHub's implementation
**Cause**: The comparison with GitHub's rendering shows that the current implementation is missing some basic highlighting features that even GitHub's "not great" implementation manages to handle better, indicating potential gaps in the syntax definition rules.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from inadequate syntax highlighting rules for Handlebars/Glimmer templates, manifesting in four main problems: inconsistent value highlighting, poor keyword differentiation, incomplete Glimmer support, and overall inferior quality compared to GitHub's implementation. The root cause appears to be the need for a more comprehensive syntax definition that properly handles both basic Handlebars features and Glimmer-specific extensions. A potential long-term solution would involve creating a separate syntax definition specifically for Glimmer templates.
