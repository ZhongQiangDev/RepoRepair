### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Values and keywords are not highlighted distinctly.
**Cause**: The current syntax definition for Handlebars in the `highlight` function does not properly differentiate between keywords (like `if`, `else`) and values (like `this.userData.isLoaded`). This results in a lack of distinct highlighting, making the code harder to read.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Values are not highlighted consistently.
**Cause**: The syntax definition for Handlebars in the `highlight` function may not be recognizing certain patterns consistently. For example, the `else if` statement might not be recognized as a single construct, leading to inconsistent highlighting of the `else` and `if` keywords.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the current syntax definition for Handlebars in the `highlight` function. It fails to properly differentiate between keywords and values, leading to a lack of distinct highlighting. Additionally, it does not consistently recognize certain patterns, such as the `else if` statement, resulting in inconsistent highlighting. To address these issues, a more refined syntax definition for Handlebars, possibly tailored for Glimmer templates, may be necessary. This would ensure that keywords and values are highlighted distinctly and consistently, improving code readability.
