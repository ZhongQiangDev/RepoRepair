Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighter incorrectly interprets `Operators.(*)` as the start of a multi-line comment
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is mistakenly treating the `(*)` pattern as the F# multi-line comment delimiter `(* ... *)`, rather than recognizing it as the multiplication operator being accessed through the Operators module

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code highlighting continues to treat the rest of the code block as a comment
**Cause**: Once the highlighter incorrectly identifies the start of a multi-line comment with `(*)`, it continues looking for the closing `*)` delimiter, causing all subsequent code to be highlighted as comment content

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The syntax highlighter doesn't properly handle qualified operator access
**Cause**: The highlighter's parsing rules don't seem to account for the F# syntax pattern of accessing operators as functions through module qualification (e.g., `Operators.(*)`)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Discord's syntax highlighter for F# having overly simplistic parsing rules that don't properly distinguish between multi-line comment delimiters and qualified operator access. The highlighter incorrectly treats `Operators.(*)` as the start of a comment block `(*`, leading to cascading highlighting errors throughout the rest of the code. This is particularly problematic for F# code that makes use of operator functions through the Operators module. The highlighter needs to be updated to recognize the context-specific meaning of `(*)` when it appears as part of a qualified operator access.
