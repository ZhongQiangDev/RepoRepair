Let me analyze the LaTeX syntax highlighting issues described:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: LaTeX commands inside braces (like \eTiX, \TeX, \!, \~) are not being highlighted properly in the first code example
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter (highlight.js) is treating content inside braces as string literals rather than parsing it as LaTeX code, causing commands to lose their special highlighting

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting behavior for commands inside braces in the tex.sx post examples (some commands like \hbox are highlighted while others like \, are not)
**Cause**: The highlighter appears to have special handling for certain "primitive" LaTeX commands (like \hbox) but fails to properly highlight other standard commands when they appear inside braces

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Mathematical expressions and special characters inside braces in fractions and other mathematical constructs lose proper syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The highlighter's grammar rules likely don't properly recurse into nested brace structures while maintaining the LaTeX parsing context, instead treating brace contents as plain text

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from highlight.js incorrectly treating LaTeX brace contents as string literals rather than continuing to parse them as LaTeX code. This leads to three main problems: 1) Loss of command highlighting inside braces, 2) Inconsistent handling of different types of LaTeX commands within braces, and 3) Improper highlighting of mathematical expressions in nested brace structures. The syntax highlighter needs to be modified to properly recurse into braced content while maintaining LaTeX parsing context, since braces in LaTeX are grouping constructs that can contain any valid LaTeX code rather than string literals.
