### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: `BigInt` is not highlighted as a built-in type like `Number`.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting configuration for `ecmascript` and `javascript` does not include `BigInt` in its list of recognized built-in types. This omission results in `BigInt` being treated as a regular identifier rather than a special type.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array` are also not highlighted as built-in types.
**Cause**: Similar to the issue with `BigInt`, the syntax highlighting configuration does not include `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array` in its list of recognized built-in types. These types are part of the JavaScript language but are not yet included in the syntax highlighting rules.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The string `'1'` is highlighted as a string type, but it is being passed to `BigInt`, which converts it into a BigInt type.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting does not differentiate between the type of the variable being assigned (`BigInt`) and the type of the value being passed to the constructor (`string`). This is a limitation of the syntax highlighting system, which typically highlights based on the literal type of the value rather than its intended use or conversion.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the syntax highlighting configuration for `ecmascript` and `javascript` is missing `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` in its list of recognized built-in types. This omission causes these types to be treated as regular identifiers rather than special types. Additionally, the syntax highlighting system does not account for type conversions, leading to the string `'1'` being highlighted as a string type even though it is being converted to a BigInt type. To resolve these issues, the syntax highlighting configuration needs to be updated to include these built-in types and potentially improve its handling of type conversions.
