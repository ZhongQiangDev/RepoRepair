### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `switch` statement is highlighted differently from other control flow statements (`if`, `while`, `for`) in version 10.7.0.
**Cause**: The change in the highlighting behavior is likely due to a modification in the syntax highlighting rules for C++ in hljs 10.7.0. The `switch` statement might have been categorized differently or given a distinct style class, causing it to appear with a different color compared to other control flow statements.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `switch` statement is not highlighted consistently across different versions of hljs.
**Cause**: The inconsistency in highlighting between versions 10.6.0 and 10.7.0 suggests a regression in the syntax highlighting logic. This could be due to a bug introduced in version 10.7.0 or an intentional change in the highlighting rules that was not thoroughly tested for compatibility with existing codebases.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inconsistent highlighting of the `switch` statement in C++ code when using hljs 10.7.0. This is likely caused by a change in the syntax highlighting rules or a regression in the highlighting logic. To resolve this, the highlighting rules for the `switch` statement should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure consistent behavior across different versions of hljs.
