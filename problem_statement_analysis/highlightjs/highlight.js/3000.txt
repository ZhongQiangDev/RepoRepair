### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighter incorrectly identifies the arrow function parameters and return values as `title` instead of `variable`.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is not correctly recognizing the structure of PHP arrow functions. It seems to be expecting a title or label where the parameters and return values are placed, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Comments in the code are highlighted as `title` instead of being recognized as comments.
**Cause**: The highlighter is misinterpreting the comments as titles, likely due to the same issue with recognizing the correct syntax for PHP arrow functions. This causes the highlighter to incorrectly apply the `title` style to the comments.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the syntax highlighter is not correctly recognizing the structure of PHP arrow functions. This leads to incorrect highlighting of parameters, return values, and comments as `title` instead of their correct types (`variable` and `comment`). The highlighter needs to be updated to properly handle the syntax of PHP arrow functions to resolve these issues.
