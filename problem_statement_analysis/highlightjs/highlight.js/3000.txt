Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: PHP arrow functions' parameters and body are incorrectly highlighted as titles (shown in orange color) instead of being highlighted as regular PHP code
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be misinterpreting the arrow function syntax (fn($x) => ...) as some kind of documentation or title block, likely because it doesn't properly recognize the newer PHP arrow function syntax introduced in PHP 7.4

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Comments in the longer code example are highlighted in orange (title color) instead of the standard comment color
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter seems to be treating inline comments following the arrow function as part of what it incorrectly identifies as a title block, cascading the initial misidentification of the arrow function syntax

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Variables within the arrow functions aren't highlighted with proper variable coloring
**Cause**: Since the syntax highlighter is treating the entire arrow function block as a title, it's not applying the standard PHP variable highlighting rules that would normally color variables differently from other code elements

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the syntax highlighter not properly supporting PHP's arrow function syntax (fn() =>), causing it to misidentify these functions and their contents as title blocks. This results in three main problems: incorrect highlighting of the arrow function code, wrong coloring of associated comments, and failure to properly highlight variables. The highlighter needs to be updated to recognize and properly handle PHP 7.4's arrow function syntax as valid PHP code rather than documentation or titles.
