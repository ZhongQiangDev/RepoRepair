### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: `language-js` also applies the `javascript` class, while `language-javascript` does not.
**Cause**: The implementation of the class detection logic in the highlighting library might be designed to recognize `language-js` as an alias for `javascript`, but it does not recognize `language-javascript` in the same way. This could be due to a hardcoded alias mapping or a regex pattern that matches `language-js` but not `language-javascript`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Adding the `language-php` class to the code element results in an extra `php` tag being added.
**Cause**: The highlighting library might be interpreting the `language-php` class as a signal to wrap the code in a `php` tag, possibly due to a misconfiguration or a bug in the PHP language definition. This could be related to how the library handles language-specific tags or how it processes the `language-php` class.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Some themes require un-prefixed class names to work properly.
**Cause**: The themes might be designed to look for specific class names without the `language-` prefix. If the highlighting library always adds the `language-` prefix, it could interfere with the theme's ability to apply the correct styles. This could be due to a mismatch between the library's class naming conventions and the theme's expectations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues identified include the incorrect application of the `javascript` class for `language-js`, the addition of an extra `php` tag when using `language-php`, and the requirement for un-prefixed class names by some themes. These problems stem from the library's class detection logic, language-specific tag handling, and class naming conventions, respectively. Addressing these causes would involve modifying the library's behavior to align with the expected class mappings, tag handling, and naming conventions.
