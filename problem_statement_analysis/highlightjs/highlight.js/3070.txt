Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent class name handling between `language-js` and `language-javascript`
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to have different parsing rules for shortened language names (js) versus full names (javascript), leading to inconsistent class application. While `language-js` results in both `language-js` and `javascript` classes being applied, `language-javascript` only applies its own class.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Extra PHP tag being added when using `language-php` class
**Cause**: The highlighter is likely double-processing PHP code blocks when the explicit `language-php` class is present, causing it to add redundant PHP tags. This suggests the highlighter isn't properly checking for existing language indicators before applying its syntax processing.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Theme compatibility issues with prefixed class names
**Cause**: Some syntax highlighting themes are designed to work with un-prefixed language class names (e.g., `php` instead of `language-php`), causing styling inconsistencies when the prefixed versions are used. This indicates a lack of standardization in how themes handle language class naming conventions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from three main problems in the syntax highlighter's implementation: 1) inconsistent handling of shortened versus full language names in class application, 2) redundant processing of PHP code blocks leading to duplicate tags, and 3) theme compatibility issues due to inconsistent class naming conventions. These problems suggest a need for standardizing how language classes are handled and processed across the highlighting system and its themes.
