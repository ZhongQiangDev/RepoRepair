### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting does not separate the number and the keyword part when they are directly adjacent (e.g., `1if` is highlighted as a single entity instead of `1` and `if` separately).
**Cause**: The current highlighting logic does not account for the rule that keywords and variables cannot start with a number in Python. As a result, it fails to recognize the boundary between a number and a keyword when there is no space separating them.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `print` function is not highlighted as a built-in function.
**Cause**: The highlighting logic may not have a specific rule or pattern to identify built-in functions like `print`. It might be treating `print` as a regular identifier rather than a special built-in function.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the lack of proper separation between numbers and keywords when they are adjacent and the failure to highlight built-in functions like `print`. These problems stem from the highlighting logic not fully adhering to Python's syntax rules and not having specific rules for built-in functions. To fix these issues, the highlighting logic should be updated to recognize the boundary between numbers and keywords even when there is no space and to include a rule for highlighting built-in functions.
