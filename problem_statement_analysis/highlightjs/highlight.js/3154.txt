### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The heredoc without interpolation (`<<-'MESSAGE'`) is not highlighted correctly as a string.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting logic may not be recognizing the single-quoted heredoc syntax (`<<-'MESSAGE'`) as a string. This could be due to the highlighting rules not being updated to handle the specific case of heredocs with single quotes, which are used to disable interpolation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The ending of the heredoc without interpolation is not being detected properly.
**Cause**: The highlighting engine might be failing to correctly identify the closing delimiter (`MESSAGE`) for the heredoc without interpolation. This could be because the engine is not properly configured to handle the nuances of single-quoted heredocs, leading to incorrect parsing and highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the syntax highlighting engine's inability to correctly identify and highlight heredocs without interpolation in Ruby. The engine needs to be updated to recognize the single-quoted heredoc syntax and properly detect the closing delimiter to ensure accurate highlighting. Addressing these causes will ensure that both standard and non-interpolated heredocs are highlighted correctly.
