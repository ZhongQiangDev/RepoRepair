### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The text following the bold and italic formatting continues to be rendered as bold and italic, ignoring the closing bold/italic characters.
**Cause**: The markdown parser is not correctly identifying the closing bold and italic characters, causing it to apply the formatting to the rest of the document. This could be due to a bug in the parser's logic for handling nested or combined formatting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text formatting using underscores (_) and asterisks (*) for italics and bold is not consistent.
**Cause**: The markdown parser may be interpreting the underscores and asterisks differently, leading to inconsistent formatting. This could be due to the parser's rules for handling different types of characters for formatting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is with the markdown parser's inability to correctly identify and apply the closing bold and italic characters, causing the formatting to continue throughout the document. Additionally, there is inconsistency in the use of underscores and asterisks for formatting, which could be due to the parser's rules for handling different types of characters. The fix involves updating the parser's logic to correctly handle nested or combined formatting and ensure consistent use of formatting characters.
