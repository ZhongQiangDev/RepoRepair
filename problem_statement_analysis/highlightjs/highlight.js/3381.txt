### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Python identifier `_undef` is incorrectly highlighted as if it contains the keyword `def`.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting library (highlight.js) is misinterpreting the substring `def` within the identifier `_undef` as the Python keyword `def`. This issue likely stems from a flaw in the regular expression or pattern matching logic used by highlight.js to identify keywords. Specifically, the library may not be properly distinguishing between standalone keywords and substrings within identifiers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only occurs in highlight.js version 11.0.0 and later, but not in version 10.7.3.
**Cause**: There may have been a change in the keyword detection algorithm or regular expressions between versions 10.7.3 and 11.0.0. This change could have introduced a bug that causes the library to incorrectly highlight substrings within identifiers as keywords. The specific change responsible for this behavior would need to be identified by reviewing the differences between the two versions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue does not occur when the identifier is followed by a different token, such as a literal.
**Cause**: The highlighting library may be using a context-sensitive approach to keyword detection. When the identifier is followed by a different token, the library may be able to correctly determine that `def` is not a standalone keyword in this context. However, when the identifier is followed by another identifier or whitespace, the library may be unable to make this distinction, leading to the incorrect highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary cause of the issue is a flaw in the keyword detection logic of highlight.js, which causes it to incorrectly highlight substrings within identifiers as keywords. This flaw was likely introduced in a change between versions 10.7.3 and 11.0.0. The library's context-sensitive approach to keyword detection may also contribute to the issue, as it is able to correctly identify keywords in some contexts but not others. To fix the issue, the keyword detection logic would need to be updated to properly distinguish between standalone keywords and substrings within identifiers.
