### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect syntax highlighting for TypeScript generics using the `extends` keyword.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be related to a change in the TypeScript language definition within the `highlight.js` library between versions 10.2.1 and 10.3.0. Specifically, the commit [f5e24b9](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/commit/f5e24b9413265fe76ff24244e2642f47d722a8e4) may have introduced a regression that affects the parsing of TypeScript generics with `extends`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `highlightBlock` and `highlight` functions in `highlight.js` fail to properly highlight TypeScript code containing generics with `extends`.
**Cause**: The language definition for TypeScript in `highlight.js` may have been updated in a way that disrupts the recognition of certain TypeScript syntax patterns, particularly those involving generics with `extends`. This could be due to changes in the regular expressions or parsing rules used to identify and highlight TypeScript code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is observed in multiple environments, including a blog, VSCode's markdown preview, and Stack Overflow.
**Cause**: The common factor among these environments is the use of the `highlight.js` library for syntax highlighting. The regression in the TypeScript language definition within `highlight.js` affects all environments that rely on this library for TypeScript syntax highlighting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary cause of the issue is a regression in the TypeScript language definition within the `highlight.js` library between versions 10.2.1 and 10.3.0. This regression affects the parsing and highlighting of TypeScript generics using the `extends` keyword, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting in various environments that use `highlight.js` for TypeScript code. The specific commit [f5e24b9](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/commit/f5e24b9413265fe76ff24244e2642f47d722a8e4) may be responsible for introducing this issue. To resolve the problem, the TypeScript language definition in `highlight.js` needs to be updated to correctly handle TypeScript generics with `extends`.
