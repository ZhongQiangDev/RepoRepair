Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Syntax highlighting breaks after using generic types with the `extends` keyword in TypeScript code
**Cause**: The issue appears to be introduced in highlight.js version 10.3.0, likely due to a change in how the TypeScript syntax highlighter handles generic type constraints. The specific commit f5e24b9413265fe76ff24244e2642f47d722a8e4 is suspected to be the source of the regression.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of color differentiation for type definitions and keywords after the `extends` keyword
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting engine seems to lose context after processing the `extends` keyword, causing all subsequent code to be treated as plain text rather than maintaining proper TypeScript token recognition.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent highlighting between versions 10.2.1 and 10.3.0
**Cause**: A regression in the highlighting rules implementation between these versions has changed how generic type parameters are processed, leading to different visual results. The older version 10.2.1 correctly highlights the syntax while 10.3.0 fails to maintain proper token classification.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around a regression in highlight.js's TypeScript syntax highlighting introduced in version 10.3.0. The problem specifically affects generic type definitions using the `extends` keyword, causing subsequent code to lose proper syntax highlighting. This appears to be caused by changes in how the highlighter processes TypeScript generic constraints, leading to a loss of context and incorrect token classification. The issue can be reproduced consistently and affects multiple platforms using highlight.js, including blogs, VSCode's markdown preview, and Stack Overflow. The problem can be resolved by either fixing the highlighting rules in the current version or temporarily reverting to version 10.2.1 where the highlighting works as expected.
