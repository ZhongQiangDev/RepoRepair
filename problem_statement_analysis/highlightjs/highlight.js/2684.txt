Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Special shell operators like pipes (|), backslashes (\), and redirections (>, <) are not being highlighted
**Cause**: The bash language grammar in the syntax highlighter appears to be missing token definitions for these basic shell operators, preventing them from being recognized and highlighted distinctly from regular text

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Heredoc operators (<< and <<<) lack syntax highlighting
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter's bash grammar likely doesn't include specific rules for handling heredoc syntax constructs, which are more complex than simple operators since they involve multiline content

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Command substitution $(...) lacks proper highlighting
**Cause**: The grammar rules appear to be missing or incomplete for subshell expressions and variable interpolation syntax, which should highlight both the $() delimiters and potentially the content within

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Line continuation marker (\) at end of lines isn't highlighted
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter doesn't seem to have a rule for recognizing backslash characters specifically when they appear at the end of a line as continuation markers

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete grammar definitions in the bash language highlighter implementation. Several important shell syntax elements (operators, heredocs, command substitution, and line continuation) are not properly tokenized and highlighted. This makes the code less readable and harder to understand since these important syntactic elements blend in with regular text. The fix would require updating the bash grammar rules to properly recognize and apply distinct highlighting to these shell-specific syntactic constructs.

The issue affects both the 'shell' and 'bash' language modes, suggesting they might share the same underlying grammar definitions or that the 'shell' mode inherits from the 'bash' mode.
