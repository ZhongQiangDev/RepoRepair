### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `bash` language does not highlight specific characters such as `|`, `\`, `>`, `<`, `<<`, `<<<`, and `$(...)`.
**Cause**: The issue is likely due to the syntax highlighting rules defined for the `bash` language in the highlighting library being used. The rules may not include these specific characters as elements that should be highlighted. Additionally, the library may not be properly configured to recognize these characters as special elements in the context of `bash` syntax.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `bash` language does not highlight heredocs (`<<` and `<<<`) and their contents.
**Cause**: The highlighting library may not have specific rules for handling heredocs. Heredocs can be complex because their content can vary widely depending on the delimiter used. The library may not have rules to properly identify and highlight the heredoc delimiter and its content as a distinct element.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the syntax highlighting rules defined for the `bash` language in the highlighting library. The library may not have rules for highlighting specific characters such as `|`, `\`, `>`, `<`, `<<`, `<<<`, and `$(...)`, and may not properly handle heredocs. To fix these issues, the syntax highlighting rules for the `bash` language in the library may need to be updated or extended to include these elements. Additionally, the library may need to be properly configured to recognize these elements in the context of `bash` syntax.
