### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In the type parameter "OutT", the "Out" is highlighted differently from the "T".
**Cause**: The issue arises from the way the syntax highlighting library processes camel-case type parameters. It seems to be treating "OutT" as two separate components ("Out" and "T") rather than a single entity. This could be due to the library's rules for identifying and highlighting type parameters, which may not fully account for camel-case conventions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The highlighting in the JSFiddle template does not match the expected behavior seen in GitHub's markdown code fences.
**Cause**: The difference in highlighting could be due to the specific version or configuration of the syntax highlighting library used in the JSFiddle template. GitHub may be using a different version or a more advanced configuration that better handles camel-case type parameters. Additionally, the library used in JSFiddle might not have the same level of support for TypeScript's syntax as the one used by GitHub.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inconsistent highlighting of camel-case type parameters, specifically "OutT", where "Out" and "T" are highlighted differently. This is likely due to the syntax highlighting library's rules for identifying and highlighting type parameters. The discrepancy between the JSFiddle template and GitHub's markdown code fences suggests that the library version or configuration plays a significant role in how camel-case type parameters are handled. To resolve this, the library used in the JSFiddle template may need to be updated or configured to better support TypeScript's syntax, particularly for camel-case type parameters.
