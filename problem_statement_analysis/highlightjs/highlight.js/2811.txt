### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The entire line containing the decorator `@pytest.mark.asyncio` and the comment `# note use of pytest-asyncio marker` is incorrectly formatted with the `hljs-meta` class, instead of the comment section being formatted with the `hljs-comment` class.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting engine is not correctly distinguishing between the decorator and the comment on the same line. It is treating the entire line as a decorator, which results in the incorrect application of the `hljs-meta` class to the whole line, including the comment section.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment on the line `async def test_async_for(): # but this comment works ðŸ¤”` is correctly formatted with the `hljs-comment` class, but the comment on the decorator line is not.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighting engine may have a specific rule or limitation when it comes to handling comments on the same line as decorators. This rule or limitation is not applied consistently, leading to the correct formatting of the comment on the `async def` line but not on the decorator line.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the syntax highlighting engine is not correctly distinguishing between the decorator and the comment on the same line, resulting in the incorrect application of the `hljs-meta` class to the whole line. This behavior is inconsistent, as it correctly formats the comment on the `async def` line but not on the decorator line. The cause of this issue is likely a limitation or specific rule in the syntax highlighting engine that needs to be addressed to ensure consistent and correct formatting of comments on the same line as decorators.
