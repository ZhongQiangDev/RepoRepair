Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Syntax highlighting stops working after the first empty block comment (`/**/`)
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter appears to be incorrectly treating the empty block comment as a terminator for the JavaScript code block, causing it to stop processing the remaining code as JavaScript. This suggests a bug in the tokenizer/parser logic for handling empty block comments.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The console.log statement is not highlighted properly
**Cause**: As a direct result of the first issue, the syntax highlighter fails to recognize console.log as a JavaScript built-in object/method, leaving it without proper syntax coloring that would normally distinguish it from regular text.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The second block comment (`/**/`) is also not highlighted correctly
**Cause**: Since the highlighter stopped processing after the first empty block comment, it treats the second `/**/` as plain text rather than a JavaScript comment, failing to apply the appropriate comment styling.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: String literal "Hello, World!" lacks proper string highlighting
**Cause**: The string is not receiving the expected syntax highlighting because the parser has already stopped treating the code as JavaScript after encountering the first empty block comment, so it doesn't recognize string literals anymore.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the syntax highlighter's incorrect handling of empty block comments (`/**/`) in JavaScript/TypeScript code. When encountering an empty block comment, the highlighter prematurely terminates its JavaScript parsing mode, causing all subsequent code to lose proper syntax highlighting. This affects multiple elements including comments, built-in functions, and string literals. The expected behavior should be to properly handle empty block comments while continuing to highlight the rest of the code according to JavaScript syntax rules.
