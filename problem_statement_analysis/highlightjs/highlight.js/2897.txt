### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code highlighting breaks after an empty block comment (`/**/`), causing the rest of the code to lose its syntax highlighting.
**Cause**: The JavaScript syntax highlighter in the `highlight` library is not correctly handling empty block comments. It seems to misinterpret the empty block comment as the end of the comment block, leading to incorrect parsing of the subsequent code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The entire code block is treated as a single comment when it should be parsed as valid JavaScript code.
**Cause**: The syntax highlighter is not recognizing the proper structure of the code when it encounters an empty block comment. This causes it to treat the entire code block as a comment, leading to the loss of syntax highlighting for the actual code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the JavaScript syntax highlighter in the `highlight` library is not correctly handling empty block comments (`/**/`). This causes the highlighter to misinterpret the code structure, leading to incorrect parsing and loss of syntax highlighting. The highlighter needs to be updated to properly recognize and handle empty block comments to ensure accurate syntax highlighting.
