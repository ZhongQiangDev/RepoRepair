### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code snippet with JSX binary expressions enclosed in parentheses is flagged for incorrect indentation.
**Cause**: The `indent` rule in ESLint version 4.1.1 seems to have a regression issue when handling JSX binary expressions enclosed in parentheses. The rule expects a specific indentation level that is not consistent with the previous version (4.0), leading to false positives.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected indentation level for lines 6, 7, and 8 is not being met according to the ESLint rule.
**Cause**: The `indent` rule configuration specifies an indentation of 4 spaces, but the actual code uses 20 spaces for lines 6 and 7, and 16 spaces for line 8. This discrepancy is due to the regression in how the rule handles JSX binary expressions with parentheses, causing it to misinterpret the correct indentation levels.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The code works fine without parentheses around the JSX binary expression.
**Cause**: The regression issue in the `indent` rule specifically affects JSX binary expressions enclosed in parentheses. When the parentheses are removed, the rule correctly interprets the indentation levels, leading to no errors.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is a regression in the `indent` rule of ESLint version 4.1.1 when handling JSX binary expressions enclosed in parentheses. This causes incorrect indentation expectations and results in false positives. The rule misinterprets the correct indentation levels, leading to errors that did not occur in the previous version. Removing the parentheses resolves the issue, indicating that the problem is specific to how the rule handles this particular syntax.
