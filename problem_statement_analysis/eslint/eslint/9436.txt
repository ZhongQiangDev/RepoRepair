### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The reported error range includes the entire statement/expression that the constant condition is part of, rather than just the constant conditions themselves.
**Cause**: The `no-constant-condition` rule in ESLint is currently configured to report the entire node (e.g., `IfStatement` or `ConditionalExpression`) that contains the constant condition, rather than just the specific part of the node that represents the constant condition. This is likely due to how the rule is implemented, where it identifies the node type and reports the entire node's range instead of narrowing down to the specific constant condition within that node.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `"source"` property in the reported JSON output includes more than just the constant condition.
**Cause**: The `"source"` property is derived from the entire node (e.g., `IfStatement` or `ConditionalExpression`) that contains the constant condition. This is a result of the same issue as in Answer 1, where the rule reports the entire node instead of just the specific constant condition. The `"source"` property is likely generated based on the node's range, which includes the entire statement/expression.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual representation of the problem shows that more than just the constant conditions are underlined.
**Cause**: The visual representation is based on the reported error ranges, which, as explained in Answer 1, include the entire statement/expression. This results in more than just the constant conditions being highlighted, leading to a misleading visual representation of the issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `no-constant-condition` rule in ESLint is currently configured to report the entire node that contains the constant condition, rather than just the specific part of the node that represents the constant condition. This results in overly broad error ranges, misleading `"source"` properties, and incorrect visual representations. To fix this, the rule implementation needs to be updated to accurately identify and report only the specific constant conditions within the nodes.
