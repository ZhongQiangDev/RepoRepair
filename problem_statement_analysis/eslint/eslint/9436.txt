Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The error range for the if statement condition is highlighting the entire if block (from line 1 column 1 to line 3 column 2) instead of just the constant condition "true"
**Cause**: The ESLint rule `no-constant-condition` is using the entire IfStatement node's location information instead of specifically targeting the test/condition part of the if statement

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error range for the ternary expression is highlighting the entire ternary expression (from column 11 to 23) instead of just the constant condition "true"
**Cause**: Similar to Answer 1, the rule is using the entire ConditionalExpression node's location range instead of focusing on just the test/condition part of the ternary operator

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The reported source properties in the error messages include more code than necessary, making it harder to pinpoint the exact problematic part
**Cause**: The error reporting mechanism is extracting the source code based on the full node ranges rather than the specific condition ranges where the constant values appear

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is that the `no-constant-condition` rule in ESLint 4.8.0 is reporting error ranges based on entire statement/expression nodes rather than the specific constant conditions within those nodes. This affects both if statements and ternary expressions, resulting in overly broad error highlighting that includes surrounding valid code. The fix would require modifying the rule to extract and report only the location information for the constant condition portions of these statements.

The problem is primarily a matter of improving the precision of error reporting rather than the actual detection of constant conditions, which is working correctly. This would enhance the developer experience by making it clearer exactly which part of the code needs attention.
