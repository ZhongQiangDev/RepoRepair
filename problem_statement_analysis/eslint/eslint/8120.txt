### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `no-unused-vars` rule is not ignoring the `children` variable when it is part of a rest parameter in the function arguments.
**Cause**: The `ignoreRestSiblings` option in the `no-unused-vars` rule is not functioning as expected for function arguments. This could be due to a limitation or bug in the ESLint version being used (3.15.0), where the `ignoreRestSiblings` option does not properly handle rest parameters in function arguments.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The ESLint warning is still being triggered for the `children` variable despite the `ignoreRestSiblings` flag being set to `true`.
**Cause**: The `ignoreRestSiblings` option might not be fully supported or implemented for the specific use case of destructuring function arguments in the version of ESLint being used. This could be a known issue or a limitation in the parser or rule implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `children` variable is being flagged as unused even though it is part of a rest parameter.
**Cause**: The `no-unused-vars` rule might not be correctly identifying the `children` variable as a sibling of the rest parameter `props`. This could be due to how the rule processes and analyzes the destructuring syntax in function arguments.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `ignoreRestSiblings` option in the `no-unused-vars` rule is not functioning as expected for function arguments in the given ESLint version (3.15.0). This could be due to a limitation or bug in the rule implementation, where it does not properly handle rest parameters in function arguments. Updating to a newer version of ESLint or using a different configuration might resolve the issue. Additionally, the rule might not be correctly identifying the `children` variable as a sibling of the rest parameter, leading to the warning being triggered.
