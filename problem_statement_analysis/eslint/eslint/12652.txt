Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: ESLint's key-spacing rule with `align: 'value'` is causing unwanted alignment in JSX style objects, making the code formatting look unnatural and harder to read.
**Cause**: The `key-spacing` rule with `multiLine: {align: "value"}` is being applied too aggressively, treating JSX style objects the same way as regular JavaScript objects. This causes all values to be aligned to the same column, even within JSX contexts where such alignment may not be desirable.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code formatting becomes inconsistent between regular JavaScript objects and JSX style properties
**Cause**: There's no specific handling in the ESLint configuration to differentiate between regular JavaScript object formatting and JSX style object formatting. The same rules are being applied to both contexts, which leads to unexpected formatting in JSX.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The auto-fix functionality (`eslint --fix`) is modifying code formatting in a way that doesn't match common React/JSX styling conventions
**Cause**: The combination of multiple spacing-related rules (`key-spacing`, `object-curly-newline`, `object-property-newline`, `object-curly-spacing`) is creating conflicts in how they handle JSX style objects versus regular JavaScript objects.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from ESLint's `key-spacing` rule with `align: 'value'` configuration not being JSX-aware, leading to overly aggressive alignment in style objects within JSX. This is compounded by the interaction of multiple spacing-related rules that don't distinguish between regular JavaScript objects and JSX style objects. The result is formatting that, while technically following the rules, produces visually unappealing and impractical code structure, particularly in JSX contexts. A potential solution would need to either:
1. Make the rules JSX-aware
2. Add specific exceptions for JSX style objects
3. Use different formatting rules for JSX and non-JSX contexts
