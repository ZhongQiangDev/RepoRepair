### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `key-spacing` rule with `align: 'value'` is causing the properties within JSX objects to be realigned in a way that makes the code less readable and visually unappealing.

**Cause**: The `key-spacing` rule is designed to enforce consistent spacing around keys in objects. When `align: 'value'` is used, it attempts to align the values of the properties, which can lead to excessive spacing and misalignment in JSX objects, especially when the properties have different lengths.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `object-curly-newline` rule is causing the properties within JSX objects to be split across multiple lines, which can make the code harder to read.

**Cause**: The `object-curly-newline` rule is configured to enforce newlines after properties in objects when there are multiple lines. This can be problematic in JSX objects where the visual structure of the JSX elements is important for readability. The rule does not take into account the context of JSX and applies the same formatting rules as it would for regular JavaScript objects.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `object-property-newline` rule is causing the properties within JSX objects to be placed on separate lines, which can disrupt the flow of the JSX code.

**Cause**: The `object-property-newline` rule is configured to enforce newlines between properties in objects. This can be particularly disruptive in JSX objects where the properties are part of a larger JSX structure. The rule does not consider the visual structure of the JSX and applies the same formatting rules as it would for regular JavaScript objects.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The `object-curly-spacing` rule is causing unnecessary spaces around the curly braces in JSX objects, which can make the code less compact and harder to read.

**Cause**: The `object-curly-spacing` rule is configured to enforce spaces around the curly braces in objects. While this can improve readability in regular JavaScript objects, it can make JSX objects less compact and harder to read, especially when combined with other formatting rules that cause excessive spacing.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues arise from the `key-spacing`, `object-curly-newline`, `object-property-newline`, and `object-curly-spacing` rules, which are not taking into account the specific context of JSX objects. These rules are causing excessive spacing, misalignment, and unnecessary newlines, which disrupt the visual structure and readability of the JSX code. To address these issues, the rules should be configured to handle JSX objects differently or disabled for JSX contexts.
