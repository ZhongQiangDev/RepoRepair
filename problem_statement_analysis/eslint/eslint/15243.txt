### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current ESLint formatter does not support asynchronous operations, which prevents the use of the `shiki` highlighter.
**Cause**: ESLint's formatter API is designed to work synchronously, meaning it expects the formatter function to return the formatted output immediately. The `shiki` highlighter, however, operates asynchronously, requiring a promise to be resolved before the highlighted code is available. This mismatch in operation modes prevents the integration of `shiki` with the current ESLint formatter.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The existing code highlighter does not highlight all tokens correctly.
**Cause**: The current code highlighter used in the ESLint formatter may have limitations or bugs that prevent it from accurately identifying and highlighting all tokens in the code. This could be due to the highlighter's rules not being comprehensive enough or not being updated to handle certain syntax elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatter does not adhere to the ESLint rules regarding spacing and semicolons.
**Cause**: The code within the formatter does not follow the ESLint rules for code style, such as requiring spaces before and after parentheses, and the presence of extra semicolons. This indicates that the formatter code itself needs to be linted and fixed to comply with the ESLint rules.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of support for asynchronous formatters in ESLint, which prevents the use of the `shiki` highlighter. Additionally, the current highlighter has limitations in token highlighting, and the formatter code does not adhere to ESLint's style rules. To resolve these issues, ESLint needs to update its formatter API to support asynchronous operations, the highlighter logic needs to be reviewed and improved, and the formatter code should be linted and fixed to comply with ESLint rules.
