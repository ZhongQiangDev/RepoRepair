Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Current code highlighter doesn't highlight all tokens properly
**Cause**: Limitations of the current highlighting implementation in the eslint-formatter-mo package

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to use Shiki highlighter as an alternative solution
**Cause**: ESLint's formatter API only supports synchronous functions, while Shiki's highlighter is asynchronous. The current ESLint architecture doesn't accommodate Promise-based/async formatters.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: ESLint's formatter API lacks flexibility for modern tooling
**Cause**: The formatter API was designed with synchronous operations in mind, limiting the integration of modern JavaScript tools and libraries that often use async/await patterns

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from ESLint's formatter API being strictly synchronous, which creates two main problems:
1. The current highlighting solution is suboptimal and doesn't properly highlight all tokens
2. Unable to integrate modern async-based highlighting tools like Shiki

The fundamental architectural limitation in ESLint's formatter API prevents the use of potentially better async-based formatting solutions. A change to support async formatters would allow for more flexible and powerful formatting options, including better syntax highlighting through tools like Shiki.
