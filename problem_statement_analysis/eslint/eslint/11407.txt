Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The ESLint auto-fixer adds extra parentheses that create invalid JavaScript syntax in the .then() block
**Cause**: The implicit-arrow-linebreak rule is mishandling the presence of comments within the arrow function body, causing it to incorrectly wrap the code in parentheses while not properly closing them

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The auto-fixer incorrectly treats the .catch() block as an implicit object return
**Cause**: The rule is misinterpreting the catch block's structure, especially with the comment inside, leading it to add incorrect parentheses as if it were handling an implicit return of an object

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The auto-fixer can generate thousands of invalid lines in larger files
**Cause**: The initial incorrect fixes cascade into a larger problem as the rule continues to mishandle the syntax, creating a snowball effect of invalid JavaScript that grows with file size

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The auto-fixer breaks the logical flow and structure of promise chains
**Cause**: The rule's implementation doesn't properly account for promise chain contexts and their unique syntax requirements, especially when comments are present

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the implicit-arrow-linebreak rule's poor handling of:
1. Comments within arrow functions
2. Promise chain contexts
3. Block statements vs implicit returns
4. Parentheses placement and matching

The rule particularly struggles when these elements are combined, leading to cascading syntax errors that can severely corrupt code files. The fact that this rule is part of the popular eslint-config-airbnb configuration makes this issue particularly impactful for many developers.
