### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When using `--max-warnings` in combination with `--quiet`, the warnings are not displayed even when the number of warnings exceeds the specified limit.
**Cause**: The `--quiet` flag is designed to suppress all warnings, which conflicts with the intention of `--max-warnings` to display warnings when the limit is exceeded. The current implementation does not prioritize `--max-warnings` over `--quiet`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The exit code is not set to 1 when the number of warnings exceeds the `--max-warnings` limit while using `--quiet`.
**Cause**: The logic for setting the exit code does not account for the `--max-warnings` limit when `--quiet` is enabled. As a result, the exit code remains 0, indicating success, even when the warning limit is exceeded.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the conflict between `--quiet` and `--max-warnings`. The `--quiet` flag suppresses all warnings, which prevents `--max-warnings` from functioning as intended. Additionally, the exit code is not correctly set when the warning limit is exceeded while using `--quiet`. To resolve these issues, the implementation should prioritize `--max-warnings` over `--quiet` when the warning limit is exceeded, either by displaying the warnings or setting the exit code to 1.
