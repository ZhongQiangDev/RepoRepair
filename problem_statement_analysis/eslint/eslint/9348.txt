### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The error "Cannot read property 'superCalled' of undefined" occurs when running the code.
**Cause**: This error is likely due to a bug in the ESLint parser or the `babel-eslint` parser. The `super(props)` call in the constructor should be correctly handled by the parser, but it seems that the parser is not recognizing the `super` call properly, leading to the `superCalled` property being undefined.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Parsing error: Unexpected token" is reported at line 21.
**Cause**: The error message suggests that there is an unexpected token at the end of the file. This could be due to an invisible character or an unexpected whitespace at the end of the file. It's also possible that the parser is having trouble with the empty lines at the end of the file.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The location of the "Parsing error: Unexpected token" changes depending on the last line edited.
**Cause**: This behavior indicates that the parser is sensitive to the presence of empty lines or whitespace at the end of the file. When the last line is edited, the parser may re-evaluate the file and report the error at a different location.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the parser's handling of the `super` call and the presence of unexpected tokens or whitespace at the end of the file. The `babel-eslint` parser may have a bug that causes it to incorrectly handle the `super` call, leading to the "Cannot read property 'superCalled' of undefined" error. Additionally, the parser is sensitive to the presence of empty lines or whitespace at the end of the file, which can cause the "Parsing error: Unexpected token" to be reported at different locations. To resolve these issues, you may need to update the parser or check for any invisible characters or unexpected whitespace in the file.
