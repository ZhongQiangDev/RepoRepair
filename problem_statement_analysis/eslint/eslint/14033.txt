### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `--fix` command transforms `let foo = undefined;` into `const foo;`, which causes a JavaScript error because `foo` is not initialized.
**Cause**: The `prefer-const` rule is applied before the `no-undef-init` rule, causing the transformation to `const foo;` before checking for undefined initialization.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The order of rules in the ESLint configuration does not affect the order in which the `--fix` command applies the rules.
**Cause**: The `--fix` command does not respect the order of rules in the configuration file. It applies the rules in a predefined order that may not match the order specified in the configuration.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `--fix` command does not properly handle the combination of `prefer-const` and `no-undef-init` rules.
**Cause**: The `--fix` command may not have a mechanism to handle the interaction between these two rules, leading to unexpected behavior when both rules are applied.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `--fix` command does not properly handle the combination of `prefer-const` and `no-undef-init` rules, causing variables initialized with `undefined` to be transformed into uninitialized constants. This is due to the predefined order in which the `--fix` command applies the rules, which may not match the order specified in the configuration file. To fix this issue, the `--fix` command needs to be updated to properly handle the interaction between these two rules and respect the order specified in the configuration file.
