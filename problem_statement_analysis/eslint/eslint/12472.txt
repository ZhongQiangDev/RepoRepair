Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: ESLint's key-spacing rule with `align: 'value'` is causing unwanted alignment of properties in JSX style objects
**Cause**: The `key-spacing` rule with `multiLine: {align: "value"}` configuration is being applied too aggressively, affecting JSX style objects where such alignment makes the code less readable and unnecessarily spreads the properties across multiple lines

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Style objects in JSX are being reformatted in an undesired way when using `eslint --fix`
**Cause**: There's a conflict between JSX formatting expectations and object formatting rules. The ESLint configuration doesn't distinguish between regular JavaScript objects and objects within JSX attributes

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent spacing and alignment between different style objects in the same component
**Cause**: The combination of multiple formatting rules (`key-spacing`, `object-curly-newline`, `object-property-newline`) is creating unexpected interactions when applied to JSX style attributes

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting makes the code harder to read and maintain, contrary to the intended purpose of linting
**Cause**: The current ESLint rules are optimized for regular JavaScript objects but don't account for the special case of inline JSX style objects, which typically look better with more compact formatting

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from ESLint's `key-spacing` rule with `align: 'value'` configuration not being JSX-aware. This causes undesired formatting of style objects within JSX, making them less readable. The problem is compounded by the interaction of multiple object formatting rules that don't properly consider the JSX context. A potential solution would be to either:
1. Create separate rules for JSX style objects
2. Modify the existing rules to detect and handle JSX contexts differently
3. Disable these alignment rules specifically for JSX style attributes

The issue highlights a gap in ESLint's handling of JSX-specific formatting needs versus regular JavaScript object formatting.
