### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The keyboard pops up when opening the sprite library on an iPad.
**Cause**: The search bar in the sprite library is automatically focused when the library is opened, which triggers the keyboard to appear. This is likely due to the default behavior of web browsers on iOS devices, where focusing on an input field automatically brings up the keyboard.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The keyboard takes over half the screen, making it difficult to see the sprites.
**Cause**: The smaller screen size of the iPad, combined with the automatic appearance of the keyboard, results in a reduced visible area for the sprite library. This is a common issue on mobile devices where the keyboard occupies a significant portion of the screen real estate.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The sprite library is loaded with the search bar focused.
**Cause**: The code responsible for opening the sprite library might be setting focus on the search bar as part of its initialization process. This could be intentional to allow users to quickly search for sprites, but it causes issues on devices like iPads where the keyboard automatically appears.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the search bar in the sprite library is focused when the library is opened, causing the keyboard to appear on iPads. This behavior is exacerbated by the smaller screen size of the iPad, leading to a reduced visible area for the sprite library. The cause of this behavior is likely in the code that initializes the sprite library, where focus is set on the search bar. To fix this issue, the code could be modified to prevent the search bar from being focused when the library is opened, or an option could be provided to users to manually focus on the search bar if needed. Additionally, the project could be updated to the latest version of scratch-blocks, which may contain fixes or improvements related to this issue.
