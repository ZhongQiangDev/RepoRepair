### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The project's `devDependency` version range does not cover the latest version of `scratch-blocks`.
**Cause**: The version range specified in the project's `package.json` file is too restrictive and does not include the latest version of `scratch-blocks` that has been updated.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The project may miss out on new features, fixes, and performance improvements.
**Cause**: By not accepting the pull request to update `scratch-blocks`, the project will continue to use an older version of the dependency, which may not include the latest enhancements and bug fixes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The project may encounter issues with RTL layout in the new extension library.
**Cause**: The new version of `scratch-blocks` may include changes or updates related to RTL layout support. If the project does not update to the latest version, it may not be compatible with the new extension library's RTL layout requirements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the project's `devDependency` version range is too restrictive, preventing it from updating to the latest version of `scratch-blocks`. This can lead to the project missing out on new features, fixes, and performance improvements. Additionally, there may be compatibility issues with the new extension library's RTL layout if the project does not update to the latest version of `scratch-blocks`. To resolve these issues, the project should update its `package.json` file to include the latest version of `scratch-blocks` and accept the pull request.
