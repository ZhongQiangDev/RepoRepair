Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Version compatibility issue with scratch-blocks dependency
**Cause**: The new version of scratch-blocks (0.1.0-prerelease.1542293672) falls outside the currently specified version range in the project's dependency configuration

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential missing features and improvements
**Cause**: Not updating to the latest version means the project isn't benefiting from new features, fixes, and performance improvements available in the newer release

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: RTL (Right-to-Left) layout support missing
**Cause**: The current version doesn't include RTL layout support for the extension library, which is needed for languages that read right-to-left

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around version management and feature availability. The project is using an older version of scratch-blocks that lacks RTL support and other improvements. The dependency needs to be updated, but this requires ensuring compatibility with the project's version requirements. The update would bring new features and fixes, particularly RTL layout support for the extension library, but needs to be managed carefully to avoid breaking changes.
