### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current version of `autoprefixer` (8.6.5) is not compatible with the latest version (9.0.0) due to breaking changes.
**Cause**: The update to version 9.0.0 introduces breaking changes such as dropping support for Node.js 4 and 9, and removing certain browsers from Babel’s targets. These changes are not compatible with the existing version range specified in the project.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The project may not work as expected after updating to `autoprefixer` version 9.0.0.
**Cause**: The breaking changes in version 9.0.0, such as the removal of support for certain Node.js versions and browsers, may cause issues with the project’s existing codebase and dependencies. Without addressing these changes, the project may encounter errors or unexpected behavior.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The project may not be able to take advantage of new features, fixes, and performance improvements in `autoprefixer` version 9.0.0.
**Cause**: The current version range specified in the project does not cover version 9.0.0, preventing the project from utilizing the latest updates and improvements. Additionally, the breaking changes in version 9.0.0 may require modifications to the project’s codebase to fully benefit from the new features.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the breaking changes introduced in `autoprefixer` version 9.0.0, which are not compatible with the current version range specified in the project. These changes may cause compatibility issues and prevent the project from taking advantage of new features and improvements. To address these issues, the project may need to update its version range and make necessary modifications to its codebase to ensure compatibility with the latest version of `autoprefixer`.
