From the GitHub problem description, this appears to be a feature request rather than a bug report - they want to restore a watermark feature that existed in version 2.0. However, I'll analyze what's "wrong" or missing in the current state:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing sprite/backdrop watermark in the blocks workspace
**Cause**: The watermark feature from version 2.0 was not implemented in the current version, making it harder for users to identify which sprite or backdrop is currently selected

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of visual context for selected sprite/backdrop
**Cause**: Without the watermark, users have to rely solely on other UI elements to know which sprite or backdrop they're currently editing

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential RTL layout issues for positioned elements
**Cause**: Right-aligned elements need special handling for RTL languages to ensure proper positioning when the interface language changes

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Unclear z-index hierarchy in the workspace
**Cause**: The z-index positioning needs to be carefully considered to ensure the watermark appears below the blocks while remaining visible, similar to the 2.0 implementation

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the absence of a visual watermark feature that existed in version 2.0. This feature needs to be reimplemented with specific requirements:
- Size constraints (48px Ã— 48px)
- Proper positioning (top-right corner, aligned with zoom controls)
- RTL language support
- 35% opacity
- Appropriate z-index placement
These specifications need to be met to restore the helpful visual context that the watermark previously provided to users.
