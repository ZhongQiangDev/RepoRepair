### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The watermark is not visible in the blocks workspace when a sprite or backdrop is selected.
**Cause**: The watermark feature has not been implemented in the current version of the Scratch interface. The absence of the watermark could be due to the removal of this feature in the transition from Scratch 2.0 to the current version.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The watermark does not appear in the top-right corner of the blocks workspace.
**Cause**: The positioning of the watermark has not been correctly programmed. According to the specs, the watermark should be positioned relative to the top-right corner and aligned with the zoom controls. If the watermark is not appearing in this location, it indicates a problem with the CSS or JavaScript code responsible for its positioning.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The watermark does not have the correct size of 48px by 48px.
**Cause**: The dimensions of the watermark are not being set correctly in the code. The specs clearly state that the watermark should have a maximum size of 48px by 48px. If the watermark is appearing at a different size, it suggests that the CSS properties for width and height are not being applied correctly.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The watermark does not have the correct opacity of 35%.
**Cause**: The opacity of the watermark is not being set correctly in the code. The specs specify that the watermark should have an opacity of 35%. If the watermark is appearing with a different opacity, it indicates that the CSS property for opacity is not being applied correctly.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: The watermark does not have the correct z-index to appear below the blocks.
**Cause**: The z-index of the watermark is not being set correctly in the code. The specs indicate that the watermark should ideally replicate the z-index from Scratch 2.0, where it appears below the blocks. If the watermark is appearing above the blocks or not at the correct layer, it suggests that the z-index property is not being applied correctly.

### Answer 6
**Wrong Behavior**: The watermark does not handle Right-to-Left (RTL) languages correctly.
**Cause**: The watermark may not have the necessary RTL tags or styles applied. If the watermark is not properly aligned or positioned when switching to an RTL language, it indicates that the code does not include the necessary RTL handling, as mentioned in the notes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the absence of the watermark feature, incorrect positioning, size, opacity, and z-index, and lack of RTL support. These problems are primarily due to the feature not being implemented or the relevant CSS and JavaScript properties not being correctly applied. Addressing these issues will require implementing the watermark feature and ensuring that the specified styles and behaviors are correctly applied in the code.
