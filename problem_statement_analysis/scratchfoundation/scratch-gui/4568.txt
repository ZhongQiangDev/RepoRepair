Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Slider monitors in Scratch 3.0 have fixed range (0-100) and cannot be modified, unlike in Scratch 2.0
**Cause**: The functionality to modify min/max values through right-clicking was not implemented in Scratch 3.0, even though the data structure supports importing custom ranges from 2.0 projects

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Decimal steps in sliders can only be achieved through an indirect, complicated method of setting decimal min/max values
**Cause**: There is no explicit setting or UI control for step size in the slider monitor implementation, forcing users to use a workaround through min/max values to achieve decimal steps

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between Scratch 2.0 and 3.0 in terms of slider monitor functionality
**Cause**: During the migration from Scratch 2.0 to 3.0, some monitor features were not carried forward, creating a regression in functionality despite the ability to import these settings from older projects

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around limitations in Scratch 3.0's slider monitor implementation. While the system can import custom ranges from Scratch 2.0 projects, it lacks the UI and functionality to modify these ranges directly. Additionally, the absence of an explicit step size setting forces users to use complicated workarounds. These problems stem from incomplete feature implementation during the transition from Scratch 2.0 to 3.0, where existing functionality was not fully replicated in the new version.
