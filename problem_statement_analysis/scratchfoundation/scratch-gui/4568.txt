### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The min/max range of slider monitors created in Scratch 3.0 is fixed to 0-100 and cannot be changed.
**Cause**: The current implementation of Scratch 3.0 does not allow users to modify the min/max range of slider monitors directly, unlike in Scratch 2.0 where users could right-click to change these values.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The step size for slider monitors in Scratch 3.0 is not explicitly configurable, making it difficult to use decimal steps.
**Cause**: The feature to set the step size of sliders is not directly exposed to users in Scratch 3.0. Users have to use a workaround by setting decimal min/max values, which is not intuitive and can be confusing.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There is an inconsistency between Scratch 2.0 and Scratch 3.0 in terms of slider monitor functionality.
**Cause**: Scratch 3.0 does not fully replicate the features and flexibility of Scratch 2.0, particularly regarding the customization of slider monitors. This can lead to confusion and frustration for users migrating from Scratch 2.0 to Scratch 3.0.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the fixed min/max range for slider monitors in Scratch 3.0, the lack of an explicit step size configuration, and the inconsistency with Scratch 2.0. These problems stem from limitations in the current implementation of Scratch 3.0, which does not provide the same level of customization and flexibility as Scratch 2.0. Addressing these issues would enhance user experience and ensure a smoother transition for users moving between versions.
