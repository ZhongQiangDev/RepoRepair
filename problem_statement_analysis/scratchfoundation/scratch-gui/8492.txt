### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The modal closes when the mouse is dragged outside its boundaries, causing the user to lose their work.
**Cause**: The modal is likely configured to close when a click or drag event occurs outside its area. This behavior is a common feature in modal implementations to allow users to close the modal by clicking outside it. However, in this case, it interferes with the user's ability to drag the sound selection handles beyond the modal's boundaries.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user's work is lost when the modal closes unexpectedly.
**Cause**: The modal does not have a mechanism to save or retain the user's progress when it is closed. When the modal closes, any unsaved changes or recordings are discarded, leading to a loss of work.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user cannot drag the sound selection handles beyond the modal's boundaries without closing the modal.
**Cause**: The modal's event handling logic does not account for drag events that extend beyond its boundaries. As a result, the modal interprets the drag event as a click outside its area and closes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the modal closes when the mouse is dragged outside its boundaries, causing the user to lose their work. This is due to the modal's event handling logic, which does not account for drag events extending beyond its boundaries. Additionally, the modal lacks a mechanism to save or retain the user's progress when it is closed. To resolve these issues, the modal's event handling logic should be updated to allow drag events beyond its boundaries without closing, and a mechanism should be implemented to save the user's progress. The suggested solution of updating react-modal may address these issues by providing improved event handling and modal management features.
