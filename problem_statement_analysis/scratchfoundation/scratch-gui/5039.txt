I'll analyze the problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The duplicate menu doesn't appear when right-clicking on a sprite after dragging it
**Cause**: The event handling for right-clicks appears to be getting overridden or lost after the drag operation. This suggests the drag operation may be changing the state or event listeners of the sprite element.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The OS's default context menu appears instead of the application's custom menu
**Cause**: The preventDefault() method is likely not being called on the contextmenu event, allowing the default browser/OS behavior to take over. This commonly happens when event listeners are not properly maintained after DOM manipulations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue occurs consistently across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
**Cause**: Since the problem manifests across different browsers, it indicates a fundamental issue in the application's event handling code rather than a browser-specific bug. The core cause likely lies in how the application manages event listeners during and after drag operations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around event handling problems after sprite dragging operations. The application fails to maintain proper right-click event handling after a drag operation, resulting in two key problems: (1) the custom duplicate menu not appearing, and (2) the default OS context menu showing instead. The cross-browser nature of the issue suggests it's an application-level problem with event listener management rather than a browser-specific bug. To fix this, the application needs to ensure proper event listener preservation after drag operations and correct prevention of default context menu behavior.
