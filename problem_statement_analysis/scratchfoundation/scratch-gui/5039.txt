### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The duplicate menu does not appear when right-clicking the sprite after dragging it to another space.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to the event handling for right-clicks being overridden or not properly registered after the sprite is dragged. This could be due to a bug in the drag-and-drop functionality that interferes with the context menu event.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The OS's context menu appears instead of the application's context menu when right-clicking the sprite after dragging.
**Cause**: The application might not be correctly preventing the default browser or OS context menu from appearing. This could be due to a missing or incorrectly implemented `event.preventDefault()` call in the drag-and-drop event handler.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The duplicate menu appears as expected on the first right-click but fails after dragging.
**Cause**: There might be a state or event listener that is not being reset or updated correctly after the sprite is dragged. This could be due to a missing or incorrect state management in the application's code that handles the sprite's position and context menu events.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to event handling and state management within the application. The drag-and-drop functionality seems to interfere with the right-click context menu, causing the application's menu to not appear and the OS's menu to take precedence. Addressing these issues will likely involve ensuring that event listeners are correctly registered and that the application's state is properly managed during drag-and-drop operations.
