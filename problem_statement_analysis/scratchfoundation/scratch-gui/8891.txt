### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current design relies solely on color to differentiate between active and inactive states of the setting switches, which is not colorblind-friendly.
**Cause**: The active state is indicated by a colored icon, while the inactive state is indicated by a grayed-out icon. This color-based differentiation is not easily distinguishable for users with color vision deficiencies.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The grayscale representation of the setting switches does not provide enough contrast to differentiate between active and inactive states.
**Cause**: The lack of sufficient contrast between the colored and grayed-out icons in grayscale mode makes it difficult for users to identify which option is selected, especially for those who rely on grayscale visuals.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current design does not provide alternative visual cues to indicate the active state of the setting switches.
**Cause**: The design relies solely on color changes, without incorporating additional visual elements such as background color changes, borders, or text labels that could help users identify the active state more easily.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the reliance on color to differentiate between active and inactive states of the setting switches, which is not accessible for colorblind users. The grayscale representation further exacerbates this problem due to insufficient contrast. To address these issues, the design should incorporate alternative visual cues, such as background color changes, to make it easier for all users, including those with color vision deficiencies, to identify the active state of the setting switches.
