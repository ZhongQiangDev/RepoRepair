Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: RangeError: minimumFractionDigits value is out of range
**Cause**: The calculation of numDecimal might be producing an invalid value for minimumFractionDigits. According to JavaScript specifications, minimumFractionDigits must be between 0 and 20. The current calculation `Math.max(Math.min(-1 * Math.floor(logDelta), 20), 0)` might be producing values outside this valid range when dealing with certain tickValues.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Locale is undefined when calling formatNumber()
**Cause**: The code is trying to access `this.chart.options.locale` but it appears to be undefined, even though it's set to 'de_DE'. This suggests either:
1. The locale setting is not being properly propagated to the chart options
2. The chart options structure is not properly initialized
3. The scope of 'this' might be incorrect when accessing the chart object

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential scientific notation handling issues
**Cause**: The code attempts to handle scientific notation for very large (>1e+15) or very small (<1e-4) numbers, but doesn't appear to have proper fallback mechanisms if the notation conversion fails. This could contribute to the range error if the number formatting isn't handled correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The scatter chart rendering error stems from three main issues:
1. A range error in the fraction digits calculation that might produce invalid values
2. An undefined locale setting that prevents proper number formatting
3. Potentially problematic scientific notation handling

The primary fix should focus on ensuring the locale is properly set and validated, and that the numDecimal calculation is bounded within the valid range (0-20) for minimumFractionDigits. Additionally, the scientific notation handling should be reviewed to ensure it properly handles edge cases.
