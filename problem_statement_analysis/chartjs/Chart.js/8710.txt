### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `locale` is undefined when calling `formatNumber(tickValue, locale, options)`.
**Cause**: The `locale` is not being properly set or passed to the `numeric` function. The code snippet shows that `locale` is accessed from `this.chart.options.locale`, but it seems that `this.chart.options.locale` is not being set correctly or is undefined at the time of the function call.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `minimumFractionDigits` value is out of range, causing a `RangeError`.
**Cause**: The `numDecimal` calculation can result in a value that is out of the valid range for `minimumFractionDigits`. The `Math.max(Math.min(-1 * Math.floor(logDelta), 20), 0)` calculation might produce a value that is either too large or too small, leading to the `RangeError`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: 
1. The `locale` is undefined because it is not being set correctly in `this.chart.options.locale`. This needs to be fixed by ensuring that the `locale` is properly initialized and passed to the `numeric` function.
2. The `minimumFractionDigits` value is out of range due to the calculation of `numDecimal`. The logic for calculating `numDecimal` should be reviewed to ensure it produces a valid value within the acceptable range for `minimumFractionDigits`. This can be addressed by adding additional checks or constraints to the calculation logic.
