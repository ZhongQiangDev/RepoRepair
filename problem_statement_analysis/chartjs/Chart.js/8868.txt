Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Horizontal axis labels (first and last) are being cut off at the edges of the chart
**Cause**: This is likely due to insufficient padding or margin settings in the chart configuration. When custom scale positions are used, the default padding might not accommodate the full width of the labels, especially at the boundaries of the chart.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unexpected extra horizontal line appearing in the chart
**Cause**: This could be related to the custom scale position implementation where the grid line rendering isn't properly handling the custom positioning, causing duplicate or unnecessary grid lines to be drawn.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between vertical and horizontal axis label visibility
**Cause**: The chart's handling of label overflow appears to be different for vertical and horizontal axes. While vertical axis labels are allowed to extend beyond the chart area, horizontal axis labels are being clipped, suggesting inconsistent overflow handling between axis types.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around improper handling of custom scale positions in Chart.js 3.0.2. The problems manifest in three ways: truncated horizontal labels due to insufficient padding, unexpected grid line rendering, and inconsistent behavior between vertical and horizontal axis label handling. These issues appear to be related to how the library manages space allocation and overflow when using custom scale positions. A solution would likely involve adjusting the padding/margin settings and ensuring consistent overflow behavior for both axes.
