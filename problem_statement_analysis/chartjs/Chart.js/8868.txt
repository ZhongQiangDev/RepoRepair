### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The first and last horizontal labels are getting cut off.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the positioning and sizing of the chart canvas. When custom scale positions are applied, the chart may not be allocating enough space for the labels at the edges, causing them to be cut off. This can be due to the chart's padding or margin settings not being sufficient to accommodate the full length of the labels.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: An extra horizontal line is being drawn.
**Cause**: This could be due to an unintended configuration in the scale options or grid line settings. When customizing the scale position, there might be a misconfiguration that causes an additional grid line to appear. This could be related to the `gridLines` property in the scale options, where an extra line might be enabled or not properly hidden.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the cutoff of the first and last horizontal labels and the appearance of an extra horizontal line. The label cutoff is likely due to insufficient padding or margin settings in the chart configuration, which fails to allocate enough space for the labels at the edges. The extra horizontal line is probably a result of a misconfiguration in the scale options, specifically within the `gridLines` settings. Addressing these configurations should resolve the observed problems.
