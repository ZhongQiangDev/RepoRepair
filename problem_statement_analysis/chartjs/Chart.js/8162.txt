### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The legend and title are rendered twice in the pie chart.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to the new version of Chart.js (v3.0.0-beta.7) where there could be a bug or an unintended behavior in the rendering process. The configuration options for the legend and title might be causing a redraw, leading to the duplication. Specifically, the `plugins.legend` and `plugins.title` configurations might be interacting in a way that triggers the double rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The duplication does not occur in the LINE chart.
**Cause**: The LINE chart might have different default settings or rendering logic compared to the PIE chart in the new version of Chart.js. The LINE chart's configuration might not trigger the same redraw behavior as the PIE chart, which could be due to differences in how the legend and title are handled for different chart types.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The duplication is not observed in previous versions of Chart.js.
**Cause**: The new version (v3.0.0-beta.7) might have introduced changes in the rendering pipeline or the way plugins are handled, which could be causing the double rendering issue. These changes might not be present or might be handled differently in the previous versions, leading to the correct rendering without duplication.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary cause of the double rendering of the legend and title in the PIE chart is likely related to a bug or unintended behavior in the new version of Chart.js (v3.0.0-beta.7). The configuration options for the legend and title might be interacting in a way that triggers a redraw. The LINE chart does not exhibit this behavior due to differences in its rendering logic or default settings. The issue is not present in previous versions, indicating that the changes introduced in the new version are the root cause. To resolve this, further investigation into the Chart.js v3.0.0-beta.7 release notes and possibly adjusting the configuration options might be necessary.
