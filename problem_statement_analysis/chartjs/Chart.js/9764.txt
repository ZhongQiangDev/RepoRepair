### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When the hover radius is set to 0, the bubble disappears on hover.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the hover radius is being applied as an absolute value rather than an additional value to the base radius. When the hover radius is set to 0, it might be incorrectly interpreted as a command to set the bubble's radius to 0, causing the bubble to disappear. This could be due to a bug in the Chart.js library where the hover radius is not being correctly added to the base radius when it is set to 0.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: When the hover radius is set to the same as the radius, the bubble gets bigger.
**Cause**: This behavior is actually expected according to the documentation. The hover radius is defined as an additional radius when hovered. So, if the hover radius is set to the same value as the base radius, the bubble will indeed get bigger because the hover radius is being added to the base radius. However, if this behavior is not as expected, it could be due to a misunderstanding of how the hover radius is supposed to work. The hover radius should be an additional value, not a replacement value.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is with the interpretation and application of the hover radius when it is set to 0. The Chart.js library seems to be incorrectly applying the hover radius as an absolute value rather than an additional value, causing the bubble to disappear. The second behavior, where the bubble gets bigger when the hover radius is set to the same as the radius, is actually expected behavior according to the documentation. However, it could be a source of confusion if the expected behavior is different. To fix the issue, the Chart.js library needs to correctly apply the hover radius as an additional value to the base radius, even when it is set to 0.
