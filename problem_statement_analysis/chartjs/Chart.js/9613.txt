### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Tooltip does not appear when the user touches any part of the graph using `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events after upgrading from v2.9.4 to v3.5.1.
**Cause**: The event types are being normalized in the new version of Chart.js. The original event types (`pointerdown` and `pointerup`) are not matching the normalized event types (`mousedown` and `mouseup`) used by the tooltip plugin. This mismatch prevents the tooltip from being triggered.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tooltip only shows when the point is hovered, but not when the user touches the graph.
**Cause**: The configuration for the tooltip plugin in the new version of Chart.js does not include the normalized event types (`mousedown` and `mouseup`). As a result, the tooltip plugin does not recognize the `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events, leading to the tooltip not being displayed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the mismatch between the original event types (`pointerdown` and `pointerup`) and the normalized event types (`mousedown` and `mouseup`) used by the tooltip plugin in the new version of Chart.js. This mismatch prevents the tooltip from being triggered when the user touches the graph. To fix this, the normalized event types should be added to the `options.plugins.tooltip` configuration. This will ensure that the tooltip is displayed when the user touches any part of the graph.
