### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onLeave` event is not consistently called when the mouse is moved outside the legend, causing the highlight to persist even when the cursor is outside the chart area.

**Cause**: The inconsistency in calling the `onLeave` event might be due to the way the event listeners are attached and managed within the Chart.js library. Specifically, the event handling mechanism might not be robust enough to handle rapid mouse movements or edge cases where the mouse exits the chart area quickly. This could result in the event not being triggered or being delayed, leading to the highlight persisting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The console logs show that the `onHover` and `onLeave` events are not always logged in a consistent manner, indicating that the event handling logic might be flawed.

**Cause**: The event handling logic in the Chart.js library might not be optimized for handling rapid mouse movements or edge cases. This could be due to the way the event listeners are attached, the timing of the event firing, or the cleanup of the event listeners. Additionally, the use of a wrapper library like React-ChartJS-2 might introduce additional complexity and potential issues in event handling.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the inconsistent calling of the `onLeave` event and the flawed event handling logic. These issues are likely caused by the way the event listeners are managed within the Chart.js library and the potential complexity introduced by the wrapper library. To address these issues, it might be necessary to optimize the event handling mechanism, ensure proper cleanup of event listeners, and potentially use a different approach for handling mouse events in the chart area.
