### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Bars with a value of 0 are rendering with the bottom two corners ignoring the `borderRadius` setting and appearing as semi-circles with flat bottoms.
**Cause**: The `borderSkipped` property is set to `false`, which should ideally apply the `borderRadius` to all corners. However, there seems to be a bug in the rendering logic where the bottom corners are not respecting the `borderRadius` when the bar value is 0. This could be due to the way Chart.js calculates and applies the `borderRadius` for bars with a `minBarLength` when the actual value is 0.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `borderRadius` is not uniformly applied to all corners of the 0-value bars, leading to inconsistent visual representation.
**Cause**: The `minBarLength` property is set to 50, which forces the bars to have a minimum length even when their value is 0. This minimum length, combined with the `borderRadius`, might be causing a conflict in the rendering process. The rendering engine might be prioritizing the `minBarLength` over the `borderRadius` for the bottom corners, leading to the observed semi-circular flat bottoms.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `borderRadius` is not being uniformly applied to all corners of the 0-value bars, specifically the bottom corners. This is likely due to a bug in the rendering logic when `borderSkipped` is set to `false` and `minBarLength` is applied. The rendering engine seems to be prioritizing the `minBarLength` over the `borderRadius` for the bottom corners, leading to the inconsistent visual representation. To fix this, the rendering logic needs to be adjusted to ensure that the `borderRadius` is respected for all corners, even when the bar value is 0 and `minBarLength` is applied.
