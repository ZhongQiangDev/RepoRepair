Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The bottom corners of 0-value bars don't respect the borderRadius setting
**Cause**: When minBarLength is set along with borderRadius and borderSkipped: false, there appears to be a rendering conflict in Chart.js where the bottom corners' border radius calculation is being ignored or overridden for bars with 0 value. This likely happens because the minBarLength property forces a minimum height that interferes with the normal border radius rendering logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent visual appearance between 0-value and non-0-value bars
**Cause**: The chart's rendering engine is treating 0-value bars differently from bars with actual values, even though they're being forced to display with minBarLength. This suggests the border radius calculation path for minimum-length bars isn't properly integrated with the standard bar rendering logic.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Semi-circular bottom corners instead of properly rounded corners
**Cause**: The combination of borderSkipped: false (which should show all borders) and borderRadius is not being properly applied to the bottom portion of minimum-length bars. This indicates a potential issue in the path drawing logic when dealing with forced minimum heights.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Chart.js not properly handling the combination of minBarLength, borderRadius, and borderSkipped: false for 0-value bars. The rendering engine appears to have a gap in its logic when these specific properties are combined, resulting in inconsistent corner rendering. The bottom corners are particularly affected, suggesting that the minimum length implementation might be bypassing or conflicting with the normal border radius calculations. This creates both visual inconsistency and a deviation from the expected design specifications.
