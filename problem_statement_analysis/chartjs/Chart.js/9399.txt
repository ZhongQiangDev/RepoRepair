### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Bars have empty space or borders between them, and not the same between each bar.
**Cause**: The `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` properties are set to `1`, but the bars still have gaps. This issue might be due to the `barThickness` property not being explicitly set. By default, Chart.js calculates the bar thickness based on the number of bars and the chart dimensions, which can result in gaps between bars.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Bars do not have 100% width as expected.
**Cause**: The `maxBarThickness` property might be limiting the width of the bars. If this property is set to a value less than the calculated width needed for 100% coverage, the bars will not reach the desired width. Additionally, the `barPercentage` and `categoryPercentage` properties might not be sufficient to ensure 100% width in all cases, especially if the chart dimensions or the number of bars change.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The bars are not visually connected like in the example image.
**Cause**: The `borderWidth` property might be set to a non-zero value, creating a visual border between the bars. Setting `borderWidth` to `0` can help remove these borders and make the bars appear connected. Additionally, the `borderColor` property might be set to a color that contrasts with the bar color, making the borders more noticeable.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main causes of the wrong behaviors are the default calculation of bar thickness, the potential limitation by `maxBarThickness`, and the presence of borders between bars. To fix these issues, explicitly setting the `barThickness` property, adjusting `maxBarThickness`, and setting `borderWidth` to `0` should help achieve the desired histogram chart with connected bars and 100% width.
