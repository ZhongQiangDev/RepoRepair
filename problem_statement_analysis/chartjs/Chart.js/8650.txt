Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The rightmost data point in the line chart is getting cut off/cropped from view
**Cause**: This appears to be related to Chart.js's default padding/margin settings in the chart area. The chart's viewport is not properly accounting for the full width needed to display all data points, including the rightmost point.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visualization is incomplete despite the data being present (as evidenced by the tooltip still working)
**Cause**: This suggests the rendering bounds of the chart canvas are not properly aligned with the data bounds. While the data exists in the dataset (shown by working tooltip), the visual rendering area is too constrained on the right side.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists without any zoom plugin being used
**Cause**: This indicates it's a core Chart.js layout/rendering issue rather than a plugin conflict. The default chart configuration is not providing sufficient padding/margins to accommodate all data points fully.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from Chart.js's handling of chart boundaries and padding in version 2.8.0. While the data is properly loaded (as shown by working tooltips), the visual rendering area is not properly sized to show all data points. This appears to be a core layout issue where the rightmost bounds of the chart are not properly calculated to include padding for the final data point. The problem is not related to any plugins but rather to the base chart configuration and rendering logic. A potential fix would likely involve adjusting the chart's padding options or modifying how Chart.js calculates the required rendering space for data points.
