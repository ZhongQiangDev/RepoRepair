### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The rightmost data point is getting cropped off in the line chart.
**Cause**: The chart's container or canvas dimensions might not be properly configured to accommodate the full width of the chart, including the rightmost data point. This can happen if the chart's width is set too small or if there are padding or margin issues that cause the chart to overflow its container.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tooltip for the rightmost data point is displayed correctly, but the data point itself is not visible.
**Cause**: The tooltip's positioning logic might be independent of the chart's rendering logic. The tooltip could be using a different coordinate system or calculation method that allows it to appear correctly even when the data point is cropped. This discrepancy suggests a problem with how the chart's data points are being rendered relative to the chart's boundaries.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue persists even though no plugins like zoom are being used.
**Cause**: The problem might be related to default settings or configurations in Chart.js version 2.8.0. There could be a default padding or margin setting that is causing the chart to not fully render the rightmost data point. Additionally, there might be a bug or limitation in the version of Chart.js being used that affects how the chart is rendered when it reaches the edge of the canvas.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the rightmost data point is being cropped off due to improper configuration of the chart's dimensions or padding. The tooltip's correct display suggests a discrepancy between the tooltip and data point rendering logic. The problem is likely related to default settings in Chart.js 2.8.0, which might need to be adjusted or overridden to ensure the full chart is displayed correctly. To resolve this, one could try adjusting the chart's width, padding, or margins, or updating to a newer version of Chart.js that may have fixed this issue.
