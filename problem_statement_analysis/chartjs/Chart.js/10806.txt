### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The border of the initial circle appears when hovering over the pie chart slice with the value "385" while using the `hoverOffset` option.
**Cause**: The `hoverOffset` option in Chart.js is designed to create a visual separation between the hovered slice and the rest of the pie chart. However, when the pie chart contains a single non-zero value (385) and the rest are zeros, the calculation for the hover effect might not handle the edge case properly. This can lead to the initial circle's border being visible, which is not the expected behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The hover effect is not consistent when the pie chart has a single non-zero value and the rest are zeros.
**Cause**: The algorithm used by Chart.js to calculate the hover effect might not be optimized for scenarios where there is a significant imbalance in the data values. When the pie chart has a single non-zero value, the hover effect calculation might not account for the fact that the slice occupies the entire pie chart, leading to unexpected visual artifacts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `hoverOffset` option in Chart.js does not handle the edge case where the pie chart has a single non-zero value and the rest are zeros. This results in the initial circle's border being visible when hovering, which is not the expected behavior. The cause of this issue is likely related to the algorithm used to calculate the hover effect, which might not be optimized for such scenarios. To fix this issue, the hover effect calculation algorithm in Chart.js should be reviewed and updated to handle this edge case properly.
