### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Clicking on a multi-line legend label triggers the action for the label above it instead of the intended label.
**Cause**: The issue arises from how the click event is being handled in the Chart.js library. When the legend is positioned on the right and labels are multi-line, the click event's coordinates might be misaligned with the intended label due to incorrect calculation of the label's bounding box or event target. This misalignment becomes more pronounced with an increasing number of labels.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem worsens with more labels, indicating a cumulative error in the event handling.
**Cause**: The cumulative error is likely due to the way the library calculates the vertical spacing between labels. If the spacing calculation does not account for the additional height of multi-line labels, it can lead to a progressive misalignment as more labels are added. This results in the click event being consistently off by a certain number of pixels for each additional label.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect handling of click events on multi-line legend labels, caused by misalignment in the calculation of label positions and bounding boxes. This misalignment is exacerbated by the cumulative error in vertical spacing calculations as the number of labels increases. Addressing this requires a fix in the event handling logic to accurately determine the target label based on the click coordinates, taking into account the height of multi-line labels.
