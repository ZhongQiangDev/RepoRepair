### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `RangeError: minimumFractionDigits value is out of range` is being thrown.
**Cause**: The `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` values are set to `NaN` when calling `new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, options)`. The `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor expects these values to be integers within a specific range, and `NaN` is not a valid value, causing the error.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The chart height is being calculated as `NaN`.
**Cause**: During the chart layout update, the `availableHeight` is calculated as `-31`, which is then used in further calculations. This negative value leads to incorrect computations, eventually resulting in `NaN` values for `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The chart is not being rendered correctly due to the error.
**Cause**: The error is thrown during the chart initialization process, specifically when trying to format numbers for the chart's tick labels. This prevents the chart from being fully constructed and displayed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue stems from the incorrect calculation of `availableHeight` during the chart layout update, leading to negative values that propagate through the system. This results in `NaN` values for `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits`, causing the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor to throw a `RangeError`. To resolve this, the calculation of `availableHeight` should be reviewed to ensure it does not produce negative values, and the handling of `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` should include checks to prevent `NaN` values from being passed to the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor.
