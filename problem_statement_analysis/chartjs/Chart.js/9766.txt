Let me analyze this GitHub issue about Chart.js stacked line charts.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Stacked line charts always start from zero on the y-axis even when beginAtZero is set to false
**Cause**: The chart's auto-scaling algorithm likely isn't taking into account the stacked nature of the data when calculating the minimum y-axis value. It's treating each dataset independently rather than considering their cumulative values in stacked mode.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to properly scale y-axis for dynamic data ranges in stacked mode
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't properly handle the automatic scale calculation for stacked datasets, especially when dealing with varying ranges of values. The scale calculation logic appears to default to zero instead of calculating based on the actual minimum values of the stacked data.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Manual min value setting workaround isn't practical for dynamic data
**Cause**: While setting a manual minimum scale value could work as a workaround, it's not feasible when dealing with dynamic data that has a wide range of possible values. This indicates a fundamental issue with the automatic scaling logic for stacked charts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Chart.js's y-axis scaling algorithm not properly handling stacked line charts. The main problems are: forced zero-based scaling despite settings, improper handling of cumulative values in stacked mode, and lack of proper auto-scaling for dynamic data ranges. This appears to be a bug in the chart library's core scaling logic specifically for stacked line charts, where it's not considering the cumulative nature of stacked data when calculating axis bounds.
