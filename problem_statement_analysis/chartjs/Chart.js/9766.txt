### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The stacked line charts always begin at zero on the y-axis, even when `beginAtZero` is set to `false`.
**Cause**: This issue arises because, in stacked line charts, Chart.js calculates the y-axis ticks based on the total stack values rather than individual data points. When stacking is enabled, Chart.js assumes that the baseline for each stack is zero, which results in the y-axis always starting from zero. This behavior is hardcoded in the way Chart.js handles stacked datasets and does not take into account the `beginAtZero` setting for individual datasets.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The inability to set the `scales.min` value dynamically for datasets with a large range of possible values.
**Cause**: The `scales.min` option in Chart.js is a global setting for the entire y-axis and does not adapt dynamically based on the data range of individual datasets. When dealing with datasets that have a large range of possible values, setting a fixed `min` value might not be feasible or practical. This limitation is due to the design of Chart.js, which does not provide a built-in mechanism to automatically adjust the `min` value based on the data's characteristics.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that stacked line charts in Chart.js always start the y-axis at zero, disregarding the `beginAtZero` setting. This is due to the way Chart.js calculates y-axis ticks for stacked datasets. Additionally, there is a limitation in dynamically setting the `scales.min` value for datasets with a large range of values, as Chart.js does not provide a mechanism to automatically adjust this setting based on the data. To address these issues, one might need to explore custom solutions or modifications to Chart.js to better suit the specific requirements of the data visualization.
