### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: A tick is sometimes rendered outside of the user-defined `max` axis limit when `includeBounds=false`.
**Cause**: The calculation of the tick positions does not properly account for the `includeBounds=false` setting, especially when dealing with small axis limits. This can lead to ticks being placed beyond the `max` limit, as the algorithm may not correctly truncate or adjust the tick generation to fit within the specified bounds.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual representation of the eye diagram appears with extra space next to it when the issue occurs.
**Cause**: The incorrect placement of ticks outside the `max` limit causes the chart to allocate additional space for these ticks, leading to an unbalanced and less aesthetically pleasing visualization. This disrupts the intended compactness of the eye diagram, which is crucial for its proper interpretation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue stems from the tick generation algorithm not fully respecting the `includeBounds=false` setting, particularly in scenarios with small axis limits. This results in ticks being placed outside the `max` limit, which in turn affects the visual presentation of the eye diagram by introducing unnecessary space. The proposed fix aims to address this by ensuring that ticks are strictly confined within the user-defined limits, thereby improving the visual accuracy and compactness of the chart.
