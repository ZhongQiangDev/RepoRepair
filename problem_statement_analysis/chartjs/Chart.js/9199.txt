### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Text goes off screen and is not rendered at all when `rtl: true` is set in the legend.
**Cause**: The `_textX` function in the Chart.js v3 codebase is not rtl-aware. This function is responsible for calculating the x-coordinate for text rendering, but it does not take into account the rtl direction, causing the text to be rendered off-screen.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: `renderText` function renders multiple lines always aligned to the left, ignoring the rtl alignment.
**Cause**: The `renderText` function in the Chart.js v3 codebase has been refactored and no longer considers the alignment property when rendering multiple lines. This results in text being aligned to the left regardless of the rtl setting, which is incorrect for rtl languages.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Major regressions in the rtl helper functionality.
**Cause**: The rtl helper that was originally written for Chart.js v2 has been significantly changed or removed during the refactor to v3. This has led to a loss of functionality that was previously handling rtl text rendering correctly. The new implementation does not adequately replace the original helper, leading to these regressions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the refactor of Chart.js from v2 to v3, which has led to a loss of rtl functionality. The `_textX` function needs to be updated to be rtl-aware to prevent text from going off-screen. The `renderText` function must be modified to consider the alignment property for multiple lines. Additionally, the rtl helper functionality that was present in v2 needs to be restored or replaced with an equivalent solution in v3 to address the major regressions. These changes will enable the proper rendering of rtl text in the legend, allowing for a seamless upgrade to v3.
