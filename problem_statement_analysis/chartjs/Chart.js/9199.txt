Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Legend text goes off screen or is not rendered at all when RTL (right-to-left) is enabled
**Cause**: The refactoring in Chart.js v3 appears to have broken the RTL helper functionality that was working in v2. The `_textX` positioning calculation likely doesn't account for RTL text direction.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Legend box positioning is incorrect in RTL mode (should be to the right of the text)
**Cause**: The legend rendering logic in v3 doesn't properly handle the RTL flag for positioning elements. The original RTL helper that handled this positioning in v2 was changed during the v3 refactor.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple lines of text are always left-aligned, ignoring RTL settings
**Cause**: The `renderText` function in v3 doesn't respect alignment settings for multi-line text. The text alignment logic appears to be hardcoded to left alignment instead of being alignment-aware.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The migration to Chart.js v3 introduced several RTL-related regressions that weren't present in v2. The main issues stem from:
1. Broken RTL helper functionality affecting text positioning and rendering
2. Incorrect legend box positioning relative to text in RTL mode
3. Loss of alignment awareness in multi-line text rendering

These issues appear to be primarily caused by architectural changes in v3 that didn't properly maintain RTL support that existed in v2. The `_textX` positioning and `renderText` functions need to be updated to be RTL-aware to fix these regressions.
