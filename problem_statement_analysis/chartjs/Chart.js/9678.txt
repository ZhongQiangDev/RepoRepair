### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The border thickness of the chart has increased since version 3.5.0.
**Cause**: There might have been a change in the default styling or the way the `borderWidth` property is interpreted in the newer versions of Chart.js. This could be due to a modification in the CSS or the rendering logic of the chart borders.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Adjusting the `borderWidth` affects both the chart and the legend borders, which is not the desired outcome.
**Cause**: The `borderWidth` property is likely applied globally to all elements that have a border, including both the chart and the legend. There might not be a specific property or configuration option to control the border thickness of the chart independently from the legend in the newer versions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The chart appears much larger in the documentation for the latest version, which might affect the perception of border thickness.
**Cause**: The layout or styling of the documentation page might have changed, causing the chart to be displayed at a different size. This change in size could make the border appear thicker even if the actual `borderWidth` value has not changed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the increased border thickness of the chart and the lack of independent control over the chart and legend borders. These problems are likely caused by changes in the default styling, rendering logic, and documentation layout in the newer versions of Chart.js. To address these issues, the developers may need to review the changes made in version 3.5.0 and consider providing more granular control over the border properties for different chart elements.
