Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Chart border thickness increased unexpectedly in Chart.js versions 3.5.0+
**Cause**: A change in the default borderWidth behavior was introduced in version 3.5.0, making borders appear thicker than in previous versions (like 3.4.1) when using the same borderWidth value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unable to adjust chart border thickness independently from legend border
**Cause**: The borderWidth property appears to be globally applied to both chart elements and legend elements, without separate control options for each component.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Setting borderWidth: 1 results in borders that are too thin compared to the previous version
**Cause**: The scaling or rendering logic for border widths changed in version 3.5.0+, causing the same numerical values to produce different visual results compared to version 3.4.1.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from changes introduced in Chart.js 3.5.0 that affected border rendering behavior. The problem is compounded by the lack of independent control over border thickness for different chart components (chart vs legend). This creates a situation where users cannot maintain their previous border appearance without compromising either the chart or legend styling. The changes appear to be a breaking change in terms of visual consistency, even though the same configuration values are being used.
