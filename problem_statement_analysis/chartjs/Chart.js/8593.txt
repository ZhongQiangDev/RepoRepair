Let me analyze the radar chart rotation issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The radar chart is fixed at -0.5*Math.PI rotation and cannot be customized to rotate to 1.22*Math.PI as desired
**Cause**: The rotation angle appears to be hardcoded in the chart configuration or the charting library being used is not exposing the rotation property as a configurable option

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The starting point of the radar chart spokes is locked to the top position
**Cause**: Most radar chart libraries default to starting at -90 degrees (-0.5*Math.PI) position and may not provide built-in methods to override this default behavior

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The chart data points and labels maintain their original positions despite attempts to rotate the chart
**Cause**: The rotation transformation is likely not being applied to all chart components (points, labels, axes) holistically, suggesting either:
1. Missing rotation parameters in the chart configuration
2. The charting library's rotation API is not being called correctly
3. The specific chart implementation doesn't support custom rotation angles

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from limitations in chart rotation customization, where the default -0.5*Math.PI rotation angle is enforced without proper configuration options to modify it. This appears to be either a limitation of the charting library being used or incorrect implementation of the rotation API. The problem affects the entire chart structure including data points, labels, and axes, preventing them from rotating together to the desired 1.22*Math.PI position. To resolve this, either the charting library needs to be checked for supported rotation methods, or an alternative library with better rotation support may need to be considered.
