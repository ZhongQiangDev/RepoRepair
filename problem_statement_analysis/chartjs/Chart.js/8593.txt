### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Radar Chart is not rotating as expected when the user attempts to set a custom rotation angle (1.22 * Math.PI).
**Cause**: The Radar Chart's rotation functionality might be hardcoded to a default value (-0.5 * Math.PI), and there may not be an option or API provided to change this value. This could be due to the library's limitations or the absence of a configurable rotation property.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Radar Chart appears to be stuck at a fixed orientation, despite the user's attempts to rotate it.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the implementation of the rotation logic within the Radar Chart library. The library might not be processing or applying the custom rotation angle correctly, possibly due to a bug or an oversight in the code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user is unable to achieve the desired rotation angle for the Radar Chart.
**Cause**: The documentation or examples provided by the library might not clearly explain how to set a custom rotation angle. This could lead to confusion and incorrect implementation attempts by the user.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Radar Chart is not rotating as expected because of hardcoded default rotation values, potential issues with the rotation logic implementation, and possibly unclear documentation. To resolve this, the library developers should provide a configurable rotation property, ensure the rotation logic is correctly implemented, and update the documentation to include clear examples of how to set custom rotation angles.
