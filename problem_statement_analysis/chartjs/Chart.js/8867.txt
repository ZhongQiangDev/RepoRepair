Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Chart adds extra padding on left and right sides when xAxis is enabled
**Cause**: The default Chart.js behavior automatically adds padding to ensure tick labels are centered with their corresponding data points, particularly for the first and last data points. This is built into the library's default rendering logic to prevent tick labels from being cut off.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No built-in option to render axis ticks inside the chart bounds
**Cause**: Chart.js currently lacks a configuration option like `ticksInside` that would allow users to specify whether ticks should be rendered inside the chart area rather than outside. This limitation in customization options forces users to accept the default outside positioning of ticks.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Chart cannot maintain edge-to-edge display when axes are enabled
**Cause**: The current architecture of Chart.js prioritizes tick label readability over space efficiency by always placing ticks and labels outside the chart area. This design decision means that enabling axes will always consume extra space outside the main chart bounds.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around Chart.js's inflexible tick rendering system, which always places ticks and labels outside the chart area. This results in three related problems: unwanted padding, lack of internal tick rendering options, and inability to maintain edge-to-edge displays with axes enabled. The root cause appears to be the library's default design decisions around tick placement and the absence of configuration options to override this behavior. Adding a `ticksInside` option would allow users to better control space utilization while maintaining the chart's visual integrity.
