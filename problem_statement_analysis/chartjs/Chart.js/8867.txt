### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When the xAxis is enabled, there is padding on the left and right sides of the chart to accommodate the tick labels, causing the chart not to display edge-to-edge.
**Cause**: The current implementation of Chart.js automatically adds padding to ensure that tick labels are centered with the first and last data points. This padding is necessary to prevent the tick labels from being cut off or overlapping with the chart edges. However, this padding disrupts the full-width display of the chart.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tick labels are rendered outside the chart bounds, which can lead to visual clutter and misalignment with the data points.
**Cause**: Chart.js, by default, positions tick labels outside the chart area to avoid overlapping with the data points and to provide a clear distinction between the axis labels and the chart data. This design choice, however, does not cater to scenarios where users prefer a cleaner, more integrated look with the tick labels inside the chart bounds.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the automatic padding added by Chart.js when the xAxis is enabled, which disrupts the full-width display of the chart. Additionally, the default positioning of tick labels outside the chart bounds can lead to visual clutter. To address these issues, an option to render tick labels inside the chart bounds and adjust the padding accordingly would be beneficial. This would allow users to achieve a cleaner, more integrated look while maintaining the clarity and alignment of the data points.
