Let me analyze this GitHub issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Split/fragmented test organization with tests in two different locations (`rendering` and `test/rendering`)
**Cause**: Inconsistent development practices over time, likely due to different developers implementing tests in different locations without a standardized approach

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent testing methodologies being used across the codebase
**Cause**: Lack of established testing standards or guidelines, leading to developers using different approaches for similar testing scenarios

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential maintenance overhead due to duplicated test infrastructure
**Cause**: Having two separate testing approaches requires maintaining two different sets of testing utilities, helpers, and configurations

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Possible confusion for new developers working on the project
**Cause**: The split testing structure makes it harder for developers to know where to place new tests or which testing approach to follow

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from having a fragmented testing structure where rendering tests are split between two locations (`rendering` and `test/rendering`) and potentially using different testing approaches. This creates several problems including maintenance overhead, inconsistent practices, and developer confusion. The root causes appear to be a lack of standardized testing guidelines and possibly organic growth of the codebase without proper architectural planning. Unifying these tests under a single approach and location would improve code organization, maintenance, and developer experience.
