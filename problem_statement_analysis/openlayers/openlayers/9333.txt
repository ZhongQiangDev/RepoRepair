### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: There are two different approaches for testing the rendering output, which are located in `rendering` and `test/rendering`.
**Cause**: The current structure of the project has led to a split in the testing methodology, where some tests are placed in one directory and others in a different directory. This could be due to historical reasons, such as different developers working on the project at different times, or a lack of a standardized approach to organizing tests.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The inconsistency in the testing approach can lead to confusion and inefficiency for developers who need to work with the rendering tests.
**Cause**: Having two different methods for testing the rendering output can make it difficult for developers to understand where to find the relevant tests, how to write new tests, and how to maintain existing tests. This can result in duplicated effort, as developers may write new tests that overlap with existing ones, or they may miss important test cases because they are not aware of the tests in the other directory.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The split in the testing approach can make it harder to maintain and update the tests as the project evolves.
**Cause**: As the project grows and changes, it becomes increasingly important to have a consistent and unified approach to testing. With two different methods for testing the rendering output, it can be more challenging to ensure that all tests are up-to-date and that they cover all the necessary cases. This can lead to gaps in test coverage and an increased risk of bugs and errors in the rendering output.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue identified is the split in the testing approach for rendering output, which is located in two different directories (`rendering` and `test/rendering`). This split can cause confusion and inefficiency for developers, as well as make it harder to maintain and update the tests as the project evolves. The causes behind these wrong behaviors include historical reasons, a lack of standardized approach to organizing tests, and the challenges of maintaining two different testing methods. To address these issues, it would be beneficial to unify the rendering tests and use a single method for both, as suggested in the GitHub problem description.
