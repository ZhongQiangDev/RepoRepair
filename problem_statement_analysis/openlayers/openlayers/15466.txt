Let me analyze the GitHub issue description and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Image and label combinations don't work correctly when declutterMode is set to a value other than 'declutter'
**Cause**: There appears to be an implementation issue in how OpenLayers handles the rendering and placement of combined image+label elements when using different declutterMode settings.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited decluttering control - currently can't selectively declutter only text while leaving imagery (point markers) unchanged
**Cause**: The declutter option is implemented as a boolean value, which only allows for all-or-nothing decluttering. This doesn't provide the granular control needed for cases where users want to declutter specific element types (like text) while leaving others (like markers) in their original state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential rendering order issues with different declutterMode settings
**Cause**: The issue description mentions concerns about keeping rendering tests passing, suggesting there may be complications with maintaining proper z-order/rendering order when implementing more flexible decluttering options.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues revolve around the decluttering functionality in OpenLayers, specifically:
1. Implementation bugs with image+label combinations under different declutterMode settings
2. Limited decluttering control due to boolean implementation instead of more granular options
3. Potential rendering order complications when implementing more flexible decluttering options

The main architectural change needed appears to be evolving the declutter system from a simple boolean to a more sophisticated system that can handle selective decluttering of different element types while maintaining proper rendering order.
