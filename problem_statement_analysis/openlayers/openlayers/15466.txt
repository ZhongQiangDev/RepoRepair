### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Image and label combinations are not properly handled when `declutterMode` is set to anything other than 'declutter'.
**Cause**: The current implementation of `declutterMode` may not account for the specific rendering requirements of both images and labels when they are used together. This could be due to the algorithm not being designed to handle mixed content types effectively under different declutter modes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `declutter` option in OpenLayers 4.5.0 does not allow for selective decluttering of text or imagery.
**Cause**: The `declutter` option is currently a boolean, which means it can only enable or disable decluttering for all elements in a layer. There is no provision for selectively applying decluttering to specific types of elements, such as text or imagery, within the same layer.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The rendering tests regarding render order and `declutterMode` may not pass after implementing the fix.
**Cause**: The changes required to fix the image+label combinations issue might alter the existing behavior in ways that conflict with the current rendering tests. This could be due to the tests being tightly coupled with the current implementation details, making it difficult to introduce changes without breaking the tests.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the improper handling of image and label combinations under different `declutterMode` settings, the lack of selective decluttering options for text and imagery, and the potential for rendering tests to fail after implementing fixes. The causes include limitations in the current `declutterMode` implementation, the boolean nature of the `declutter` option, and the tight coupling of rendering tests with the existing codebase. Addressing these issues will require careful consideration of the rendering requirements for mixed content types and the development of more flexible decluttering options.
