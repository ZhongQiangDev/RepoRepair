Let me analyze the problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of WebGL contexts when handling larger pyramids with multiple layers
**Cause**: Creating too many WebGL contexts simultaneously when dealing with multiple WebGLTileLayers, which exceeds the browser's or system's resource limits for concurrent WebGL contexts

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor rendering performance (2-5 FPS instead of expected 30 FPS)
**Cause**: The overhead of managing multiple WebGL contexts and the system's struggle to maintain these contexts leads to significant performance degradation

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-rendered tiles appearing in the visualization
**Cause**: When WebGL contexts are lost due to resource constraints, the system fails to properly render the affected tiles, resulting in missing or incomplete visualization

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the current implementation's approach of creating separate WebGL contexts for each layer in the pyramid. This design doesn't scale well with larger pyramids because:
1. It creates too many simultaneous WebGL contexts
2. Browsers have limitations on the number of WebGL contexts they can maintain
3. The overhead of managing multiple contexts impacts performance significantly

The suggested solution of implementing a separate source for GeoTIFF pyramids using a template string and tile grid object would be more efficient as it would:
- Use a single WebGL context per layer/renderer
- Handle overlapping tiles from the GeoTIFF pyramid more efficiently
- Follow a similar pattern to the existing WMTS source implementation
This approach would likely resolve both the context loss and performance issues.
