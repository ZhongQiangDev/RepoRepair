### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of WebGL contexts leading to unrendered tiles.
**Cause**: The current implementation of WebGLTileLayers pyramid scales poorly with larger datasets. As the number of layers increases, the browser's capacity to manage multiple WebGL contexts becomes overwhelmed, leading to context loss. This is exacerbated by factors such as browser limitations, machine performance, and environmental settings.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor performance with low FPS (2-5 FPS instead of fluent 30ish).
**Cause**: The inefficiency in managing multiple WebGL contexts for each layer in the pyramid leads to significant performance degradation. The browser struggles to handle the rendering demands, resulting in a drop in frames per second and a suboptimal user experience.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inability to scale effectively with larger pyramids.
**Cause**: The current architecture of the WebGLTiles pyramid is not optimized for handling large datasets. The direct file reference approach for each layer becomes increasingly cumbersome as the pyramid grows, leading to scalability issues. This is further compounded by the limitations of the browser and machine in managing multiple WebGL contexts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the loss of WebGL contexts, poor performance, and scalability problems with larger pyramids. These issues stem from the current implementation's inefficiency in managing multiple WebGL contexts for each layer. The proposed solution of using a GeoTIFF source pyramid with a template string and tile grid object could potentially address these problems by reducing the number of WebGL contexts and improving overall performance. This approach would allow for a more efficient rendering process, leading to better scalability and a smoother user experience.
