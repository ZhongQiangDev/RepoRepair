### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGL Tile Layers in OpenLayer do not support custom blending options, specifically `gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE, gl.ONE)`, which is required for blending a subset of Tile Layers.
**Cause**: The current implementation of WebGL Tile Layers in OpenLayer does not provide an API to set different blending options. The blending function is hardcoded in the WebGL Helper class, and there is no way to modify it from the Tile Layer style.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation of WebGL Tile Layers in OpenLayer does not allow for a flag in the Tile Layer style to change the WebGL blend function.
**Cause**: The Tile Layer style in OpenLayer does not have a property or method to set the WebGL blend function. The blending options are determined by the WebGL Helper class, and there is no way to modify them from the Tile Layer style.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation of WebGL Tile Layers in OpenLayer does not provide a way to blend images from different Tile Layers with custom blending options.
**Cause**: The WebGL Tile Layers in OpenLayer are designed to render images with a fixed blending function, and there is no way to modify it. This limits the ability to blend images from different Tile Layers with custom blending options, which is required for the use case of the digital slide microscopy images viewer.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the current implementation of WebGL Tile Layers in OpenLayer does not support custom blending options, which is required for the use case of the digital slide microscopy images viewer. The blending function is hardcoded in the WebGL Helper class, and there is no way to modify it from the Tile Layer style. To fix this issue, a new API interface needs to be designed and implemented to allow for custom blending options in the WebGL Tile Layers. This will require changes to the WebGL Helper class and the Tile Layer style to support the new blending options.
