Based on the provided images, I'll analyze the WebGLTile layer rendering issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Tile images are being rendered outside their intended extent/boundaries
**Cause**: The WebGLTile layer's coordinate system or extent calculation appears to be misaligned with the actual tile boundaries, causing tiles to be placed in incorrect positions relative to their intended location.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate/overlapping tiles appearing in the visualization
**Cause**: The tile loading and rendering logic might not be properly handling tile boundaries or tile coordinates, resulting in the same tiles being rendered multiple times in different locations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent tile rendering across different zoom levels
**Cause**: The zoom level transitions or tile pyramid structure may not be properly managed, leading to tiles from different zoom levels being displayed incorrectly or out of position.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual artifacts and discontinuities in the rendered map
**Cause**: The WebGL rendering pipeline might not be correctly handling tile textures or their transformations, resulting in visual glitches and improper tile placement.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around incorrect tile positioning and rendering in the WebGLTile layer. The problems appear to stem from coordinate system misalignment, improper tile boundary handling, problematic zoom level management, and WebGL rendering pipeline issues. These issues collectively result in tiles being displayed outside their intended locations, creating visual artifacts and inconsistencies in the map visualization. The core of the problem likely lies in the spatial transformation and coordinate system handling within the WebGLTile layer implementation.
