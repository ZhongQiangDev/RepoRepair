### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGLTile layer renders error images outside the original extent.
**Cause**: The extent of the WebGLTile layer is not correctly set or is being interpreted incorrectly by the rendering engine. This could be due to incorrect extent values being passed to the WebGLTile layer or an issue with how the extent is being calculated and applied.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The rendered image appears to be skewed or distorted.
**Cause**: The projection settings might not be correctly configured. The projection used in the WebGLTile layer ("EPSG:4326") might not match the projection of the source data, leading to distortion. Additionally, the transformation between the source data's coordinate system and the map's coordinate system might not be handled properly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The image narrows when zooming in.
**Cause**: The tiling strategy or the resolution settings for the WebGLTile layer might not be configured correctly. When zooming in, the tiles might not be rendered at the appropriate resolution, leading to a narrowing effect. This could also be related to the extent settings, where the tiles are not being clipped correctly at different zoom levels.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The red box indicating the correct extent does not align with the rendered image.
**Cause**: The extent values used in the WebGLTile layer might not accurately represent the actual extent of the source data. This could be due to incorrect metadata or an issue with how the extent is being calculated from the source data. Additionally, the rendering engine might not be correctly interpreting the extent values.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The WebGLTile layer is rendering images outside the original extent, which is likely due to incorrect extent settings or misinterpretation of the extent values. The image distortion and narrowing when zooming in suggest issues with projection settings and tiling strategy. Ensuring that the extent, projection, and tiling settings are correctly configured should resolve these issues. Additionally, verifying the metadata and extent values from the source data can help ensure accurate rendering.
