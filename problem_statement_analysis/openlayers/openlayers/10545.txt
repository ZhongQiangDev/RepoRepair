### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The label "Andy&amp;apos;s" is not being properly decoded, resulting in the display of the character code instead of the intended apostrophe.
**Cause**: The text in the label is encoded using HTML entities (`&amp;apos;`), but the renderer or the `ol/style/Text` component is not decoding these entities before rendering the text. This suggests that the responsibility for decoding the text is not being handled by the appropriate component in the rendering pipeline.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The parser responsible for reading the KML data is not converting the encoded text into its proper form before passing it to the rendering component.
**Cause**: The parser may not be configured to automatically decode HTML entities in the text data. This could be due to a lack of a built-in decoding function or the absence of a configuration setting that enables entity decoding.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue arises from two main causes: the renderer or `ol/style/Text` component not decoding the HTML entities in the label text, and the parser not converting the encoded text into its proper form. To resolve this, either the renderer should be modified to automatically decode the text, or the parser should be configured to decode HTML entities before passing the data to the rendering component. This ensures that the label text is displayed correctly with the intended characters.
