### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Raster webworkers are not getting terminated.
**Cause**: The raster source creates webworkers using pixelworks but does not have a mechanism to terminate them when they are no longer needed. This leads to multiple webworkers accumulating in memory, as shown in the provided image from the Chrome DevTools memory tab.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: High memory usage and potential memory leak.
**Cause**: Since the webworkers are not terminated, they continue to occupy memory even when they are no longer in use. This can lead to a memory leak, where the application consumes more and more memory over time, as indicated by the increasing memory usage in the provided image.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is a duplicate of a previously closed issue.
**Cause**: The problem described is similar to the one mentioned in the closed GitHub issue #8375. The issue was closed due to inactivity, but the problem persists, indicating that the root cause was not addressed or the solution was not implemented.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of proper cleanup mechanism.
**Cause**: The current implementation does not have a proper cleanup mechanism to terminate the webworkers when they are no longer needed. The workaround provided in the description involves manually terminating the workers, which is a temporary fix and may break with future updates.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the raster webworkers are not being terminated, leading to high memory usage and a potential memory leak. This is caused by the lack of a proper cleanup mechanism in the current implementation. The problem is similar to a previously closed GitHub issue, indicating that the root cause was not addressed. The current workaround is a temporary fix and may break with future updates. To resolve this issue, a proper cleanup mechanism should be implemented to terminate the webworkers when they are no longer needed.
