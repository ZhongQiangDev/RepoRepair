Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: OpenLayers throws "Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length" error when trying to load GeoJSON data
**Cause**: This error typically occurs when OpenLayers encounters invalid or malformed coordinate arrays in the GeoJSON data. The error suggests that one or more geometry coordinates in the GeoJSON file contain an array with an invalid length (could be empty, null, or have incorrect number of coordinates).

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The same GeoJSON file works in Leaflet.js but fails in OpenLayers
**Cause**: This difference in behavior occurs because:
1. OpenLayers and Leaflet.js have different GeoJSON parsing implementations
2. OpenLayers is more strict in its GeoJSON validation
3. The coordinate system handling might be different between the two libraries

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The GeoJSON data displays correctly in QGIS but fails in OpenLayers
**Cause**: This discrepancy likely occurs because:
1. QGIS has more robust GeoJSON parsing and error handling
2. The GeoJSON file might have coordinate system specifications that OpenLayers is not properly handling during the projection transformation from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857
3. The data might need preprocessing or cleanup that QGIS handles automatically but OpenLayers doesn't

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a data quality/format problem rather than a code implementation issue. The GeoJSON file likely contains problematic geometry data that OpenLayers cannot process properly, while other tools (Leaflet.js and QGIS) are more forgiving. The main causes are:
1. Potentially malformed coordinate arrays in the GeoJSON data
2. Possible projection transformation issues
3. Different levels of GeoJSON validation strictness between tools
4. Lack of proper error handling in the OpenLayers implementation

To resolve this, the GeoJSON data should be validated and cleaned, ensuring all geometries have valid coordinate arrays and proper projection information.
