### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The GeoJSON data is not being rendered correctly in OpenLayers, resulting in an "Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length" error.
**Cause**: The error occurs in the `setCoordinates` method of the `MultiPolygon.js` file, which suggests that the GeoJSON data contains invalid or improperly formatted coordinates for a MultiPolygon feature. This could be due to missing or incorrectly structured coordinate arrays within the GeoJSON file.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The GeoJSON data renders correctly in QGIS and Leaflet but fails in OpenLayers.
**Cause**: The discrepancy between the rendering in QGIS/Leaflet and OpenLayers indicates a potential issue with how OpenLayers parses or handles the GeoJSON data. This could be due to differences in how each library interprets or validates the GeoJSON format, particularly concerning MultiPolygon geometries. OpenLayers might be more strict in its validation, leading to the error when encountering improperly formatted data.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is with the GeoJSON data's structure, specifically the MultiPolygon coordinates, which are not being correctly parsed by OpenLayers. This results in an "Invalid array length" error. The discrepancy in rendering between QGIS/Leaflet and OpenLayers suggests that OpenLayers has stricter validation rules for GeoJSON data. To resolve this, the GeoJSON file should be reviewed and corrected to ensure it adheres to the proper MultiPolygon format expected by OpenLayers. Additionally, checking for any updates or patches in OpenLayers that address similar parsing issues could also be beneficial.
