### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sprite offset is incorrect when the screen pixel ratio is greater than 1 and a custom color is applied to the icon style.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be related to the way the sprite offset is calculated when a custom color is applied. The PR mentioned in the problem description (https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/11277/files) may have introduced a bug that affects the calculation of the sprite offset when the screen pixel ratio is not equal to 1. This could be due to a miscalculation of the sprite's position or size when the custom color is applied.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The offset is correct when the screen pixel ratio is 1, but incorrect when the screen pixel ratio is greater than 1.
**Cause**: The problem may be related to the way the sprite offset is scaled when the screen pixel ratio is greater than 1. The sprite offset may not be scaled correctly, causing the sprite to be positioned incorrectly on the screen. This could be due to a bug in the code that handles the scaling of the sprite offset based on the screen pixel ratio.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The offset is correct when no custom color is applied, but incorrect when a custom color is applied.
**Cause**: The issue may be related to the way the custom color is applied to the sprite. When a custom color is applied, the sprite may be resized or repositioned incorrectly, causing the offset to be incorrect. This could be due to a bug in the code that handles the application of custom colors to sprites.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The problem seems to be related to the way the sprite offset is calculated and scaled when a custom color is applied and the screen pixel ratio is greater than 1. The PR mentioned in the problem description may have introduced a bug that affects the calculation of the sprite offset when a custom color is applied. The sprite offset may not be scaled correctly when the screen pixel ratio is greater than 1, and the custom color may be applied incorrectly, causing the offset to be incorrect. To fix this issue, the code that handles the calculation and scaling of the sprite offset and the application of custom colors to sprites may need to be reviewed and updated.
