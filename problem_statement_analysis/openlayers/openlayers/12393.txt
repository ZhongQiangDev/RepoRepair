### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The image is being stretched unnecessarily due to rounding up in the calculations.
**Cause**: The use of `Math.ceil` in the calculations is causing the image dimensions to be rounded up, which results in the image being stretched to fit the extent. This is likely done to prevent zero width when the scaling is negative, but it leads to the image losing its original aspect ratio.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The image does not fit perfectly into the square tile extent within JavaScript floating point tolerance.
**Cause**: The floating point calculations used in the code are not precise enough to ensure that the image fits perfectly into the square tile extent. This is due to the inherent limitations of floating point arithmetic in JavaScript, which can lead to small rounding errors that accumulate over multiple calculations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The image loses detail by reducing width.
**Cause**: The current implementation scales down the width of the image to fit the extent, which results in a loss of detail. This is because the image is being scaled down to fit the extent, rather than being scaled up to fill the extent. This can be improved by always scaling up whichever dimension needs it, rather than reducing the width.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the unnecessary stretching of the image due to the use of `Math.ceil`, the inability of the image to fit perfectly into the square tile extent due to floating point rounding errors, and the loss of detail due to the current scaling implementation. To address these issues, the use of `Math.ceil` could be replaced with rounding to the nearest pixel, the floating point calculations could be optimized to reduce rounding errors, and the scaling implementation could be modified to always scale up whichever dimension needs it. These changes would result in a more accurate and visually pleasing display of the image within the given extent.
