### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The green cross icon is clipped when using an icon style with `displacement` set.
**Cause**: The clipping issue may be due to the icon's size and the displacement value not being properly accounted for in the rendering process. When an icon is displaced, the rendering engine might not adjust the clipping area to accommodate the new position of the icon, resulting in parts of the icon being cut off.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The green cross icon does not display as expected, unlike the regular shape in the original example.
**Cause**: The difference in behavior between the regular shape and the icon style could be due to how OpenLayers handles different types of styles. Regular shapes are likely rendered differently than icons, and the displacement property might not be fully supported or optimized for icons, leading to the clipping issue.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The icon style with `displacement` does not render correctly in the provided CodeSandbox example.
**Cause**: There might be a bug or limitation in the OpenLayers library related to the combination of icon styles and displacement. The library may not properly handle the displacement of icons, especially when the icon's size and position are not aligned with the default clipping area.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the green cross icon is clipped when using an icon style with `displacement`. This is likely due to the rendering engine not adjusting the clipping area for the displaced icon, the difference in how OpenLayers handles regular shapes versus icon styles, and a potential bug or limitation in the library's support for displaced icons. To resolve this, the rendering process for displaced icons should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure the entire icon is displayed correctly. Additionally, checking for any updates or patches in the OpenLayers library that address this specific issue could also be beneficial.
