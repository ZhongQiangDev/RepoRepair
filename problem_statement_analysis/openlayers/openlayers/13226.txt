### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGL renderer incorrectly expects the source to have a tile grid.
**Cause**: The WebGLTileLayer implementation assumes that the source will always have a tile grid, which is not the case for sources that use view projection with wrapX set to false. This assumption leads to incorrect rendering behavior when the source does not conform to this expectation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Sources which use view projection with wrapX false do not work with WebGLTileLayer.
**Cause**: The WebGLTileLayer does not properly handle sources that do not wrap around the 180-degree meridian. This is likely due to the layer's internal logic that is designed to work with sources that wrap around the globe, causing issues when the source is configured not to wrap.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the WebGLTileLayer has an inherent assumption that all sources will have a tile grid and will wrap around the globe. This assumption leads to incorrect rendering when the source does not meet these criteria. To fix this, the WebGLTileLayer needs to be updated to handle sources that do not have a tile grid and do not wrap around the globe. This could involve adding checks for these conditions and adjusting the rendering logic accordingly. Additionally, adding tests to ensure that the layer works correctly with these types of sources would help prevent similar issues in the future.
