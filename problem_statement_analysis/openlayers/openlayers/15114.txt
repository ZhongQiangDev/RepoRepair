### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGL layer incorrectly draws the fill-color property over linear rings, causing overlapping colors.
**Cause**: The issue arises from the WebGL layer's handling of valid GeoJSON data. When the GeoJSON is valid according to geojsonlint, the WebGL layer seems to misinterpret the winding order of the linear rings, leading to incorrect rendering. This is likely due to a discrepancy between the expected winding order for the WebGL layer and the actual winding order in the valid GeoJSON.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGL layer displays the correct fill-color when the GeoJSON is invalid, but not when it is valid.
**Cause**: The WebGL layer's rendering logic may be dependent on the winding order of the linear rings. When the GeoJSON is invalid, the winding order might not be strictly enforced, leading to a correct display. However, when the GeoJSON is valid, the strict adherence to the winding order causes the WebGL layer to render the fill-color incorrectly. This suggests that the WebGL layer's rendering logic may not be fully compatible with the GeoJSON specification's winding order rules.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The VectorLayer implementation displays the correct fill-color regardless of the GeoJSON validity.
**Cause**: The VectorLayer implementation may have a more flexible handling of the winding order of linear rings. It seems to be able to correctly interpret and display the fill-color even when the GeoJSON is invalid. This suggests that the VectorLayer implementation may have a more robust handling of the winding order, which allows it to display the correct fill-color in both valid and invalid GeoJSON cases.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue lies in the WebGL layer's handling of the winding order of linear rings in valid GeoJSON data. The WebGL layer seems to misinterpret the winding order, leading to incorrect rendering of the fill-color property. This is likely due to a discrepancy between the expected winding order for the WebGL layer and the actual winding order in the valid GeoJSON. The VectorLayer implementation, on the other hand, has a more flexible handling of the winding order, allowing it to display the correct fill-color in both valid and invalid GeoJSON cases. To fix the issue, the WebGL layer's rendering logic may need to be updated to be more compatible with the GeoJSON specification's winding order rules.
