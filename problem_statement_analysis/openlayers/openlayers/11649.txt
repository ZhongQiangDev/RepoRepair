Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Undefined units in the projection when using proj4js definitions with OpenLayers
**Cause**: When proj4js definitions don't explicitly specify units (which is common for geographic projections), OpenLayers doesn't set a default value of "degrees". Instead, it leaves the units undefined, which leads to incorrect projection handling.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect axis orientation in the projection
**Cause**: The proj4js definitions often don't include axis orientation information (+axis parameter). OpenLayers defaults to 'enu' (Easting, Northing, Up) orientation, when for geographic CRS like EPSG:4258, it should be 'neu' (Northing, Easting, Up). This mismatch causes the map to render incorrectly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent handling of EPSG definitions between proj4js and OpenLayers
**Cause**: While proj4js can handle the EPSG definitions correctly on its own, the integration process through ol.proj.proj4.register() doesn't properly transfer all necessary projection parameters, leading to invalid projections in OpenLayers.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited axis definitions in proj4js
**Cause**: Only 28 out of 3910 proj4js definitions include explicit axis information ("+axis=wsu"), making it difficult for OpenLayers to correctly determine the proper axis orientation for most coordinate reference systems.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from incomplete parameter handling in the OpenLayers-proj4js integration. The main problems are:
1. Missing default units for geographic projections
2. Incorrect default axis orientation
3. Poor parameter transfer during registration
4. Limited axis information in source definitions

These issues particularly affect geographic coordinate reference systems and result in broken map projections when using standard EPSG definitions from common sources like epsg.io or spatialreference.org. The problem appears to be primarily in how OpenLayers handles the registration of proj4js definitions rather than in proj4js itself.
