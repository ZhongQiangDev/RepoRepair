### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `units` parameter is undefined for the projection.
**Cause**: The proj4js definition for EPSG:4258 does not explicitly specify the units. Since it is a geographic CRS, the default unit should be "degrees," but proj4js does not automatically set this default value. When OpenLayers tries to use this projection, it expects the `units` parameter to be defined, and since it is not, it results in undefined behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `axisOrientation` is set to the wrong default value ("enu").
**Cause**: The proj4js definition for EPSG:4258 does not include the axis orientation. OpenLayers defaults to "enu" (East, North, Up) when no axis orientation is specified. However, for this specific projection, the correct axis orientation should be "neu" (North, East, Up). Since the proj4js definition does not provide this information, OpenLayers uses the incorrect default value.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The map display/projection is broken.
**Cause**: The combination of the undefined `units` parameter and the incorrect `axisOrientation` value leads to the map being rendered incorrectly. The lack of proper units means that the coordinates are not interpreted correctly, and the wrong axis orientation causes the map to be displayed with incorrect spatial relationships.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the proj4js definition for EPSG:4258 not providing essential parameters like `units` and `axisOrientation`. This leads to OpenLayers using incorrect default values, resulting in a broken map display. To fix this, the proj4js definition should be updated to include the correct units ("degrees") and axis orientation ("neu"). Additionally, OpenLayers could be modified to handle missing parameters more gracefully by setting appropriate defaults for geographic CRSs.
