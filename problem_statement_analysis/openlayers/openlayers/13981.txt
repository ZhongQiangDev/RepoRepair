Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent text rotation behavior between vector layers and vector context when text has both offset and rotation applied
**Cause**: The two renderers use different pivot points for rotation:
- Vector layer renderer rotates text around the original feature point
- Immediate renderer rotates text around the offset anchor point (determined by textAlign and textBaseline)

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of support for linebreaks in text when using vector context
**Cause**: The vector context renderer appears to have incomplete text rendering capabilities compared to the vector layer renderer, specifically missing multiline text support

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Offset coordinate system inconsistency between text and icons
**Cause**: Different coordinate systems are being used:
- Text offsetY: positive values move text downward
- Icon displacement: positive values move icons upward
This creates confusion when trying to align text and icons consistently

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from inconsistent implementations between the vector layer and vector context renderers, particularly in how they handle text rotation around anchor points. The vector context renderer also lacks some text rendering features available in the vector layer renderer. Additionally, there's an underlying coordinate system inconsistency between text offset and icon displacement behaviors. The vector layer renderer's behavior is considered correct, especially when considering view rotation scenarios, suggesting the vector context renderer needs to be updated to match this behavior.
