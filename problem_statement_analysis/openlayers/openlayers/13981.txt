### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The vector layer renderer rotates offset text around the feature from which it is offset, while the immediate renderer rotates it around its offset anchor point.
**Cause**: The difference in behavior is due to the way the vector layer renderer and the immediate renderer handle the rotation of offset text. The vector layer renderer considers the feature as the center of rotation, while the immediate renderer considers the offset anchor point as the center of rotation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: When switching to vector context, the text rendering behavior changes, leading to inconsistent rendering between vector layers and vector context.
**Cause**: The vector context does not support the same level of text rendering features as the vector layer renderer, such as linebreaks in text. Additionally, the vector context handles the rotation of offset text differently, leading to inconsistent rendering.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the inconsistency in text rendering behavior between the vector layer renderer and the immediate renderer, as well as between vector layers and vector context. The vector layer renderer rotates offset text around the feature, while the immediate renderer rotates it around the offset anchor point. Additionally, the vector context does not support the same level of text rendering features as the vector layer renderer, leading to inconsistent rendering. To fix these issues, the behavior of the immediate renderer and vector context should be aligned with the vector layer renderer, ensuring consistent rendering across all layers and contexts.
