### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The top-most layer appears opaque when all layers have the same opacity value (e.g., 0.5) in OL versions 6.8.1 and greater.
**Cause**: This issue may be due to a change in how OpenLayers (OL) handles layer opacity stacking in the canvas rendering process. When multiple layers have identical opacity values, the canvas might be incorrectly stacking the layers, causing the top-most layer to appear fully opaque. This could be a bug introduced in OL 6.8.1 or a change in the rendering algorithm that affects how transparency is calculated for overlapping layers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The layers render correctly with transparency when the opacity values are slightly different (e.g., 0.49, 0.50, 0.51).
**Cause**: The difference in opacity values might be causing the canvas to correctly calculate the transparency for each layer, as the slight variations prevent the stacking issue. This suggests that the problem lies in how the canvas handles identical opacity values, possibly due to rounding errors or a specific condition in the rendering code that treats identical opacity values differently.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue does not occur in OL versions 6.7.0 and below.
**Cause**: The change in behavior between OL 6.7.0 and 6.8.1 indicates that a modification or bug was introduced in the newer versions. This could be related to updates in the layer rendering logic, canvas handling, or changes in how opacity is applied to layers. The specific change that caused this issue would need to be identified by reviewing the OL commit history and code changes between these versions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect stacking of layer opacity in OL versions 6.8.1 and greater, causing the top-most layer to appear opaque when all layers have the same opacity value. This is likely due to a change in the canvas rendering process or a bug in the layer opacity handling. The problem does not occur when opacity values are slightly different, suggesting a specific condition in the rendering code that treats identical opacity values incorrectly. The issue was introduced in OL 6.8.1, indicating a need to review the changes made in that version to identify and fix the root cause.
