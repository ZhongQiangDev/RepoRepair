### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGLTile layer renderer does not clip the image gutter before creating textures.
**Cause**: The WebGLTile layer renderer lacks the necessary logic to handle the gutter option, which is present in the ol/source/TileWMS source. This results in the renderer including the gutter in the texture creation process, leading to misplacement and duplication of images.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Misplacement and duplication of images due to unclipped gutters.
**Cause**: The WebGLTile layer renderer does not adjust for the pixel ratio when clipping the gutter. This oversight causes the renderer to incorrectly interpret the size of the gutter, leading to improper clipping and, consequently, misplacement and duplication of images.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the WebGLTile layer renderer does not properly handle the gutter option from the ol/source/TileWMS source. This results in unclipped gutters being included in the texture creation process, leading to misplacement and duplication of images. Additionally, the renderer fails to adjust for the pixel ratio when clipping the gutter, further exacerbating the problem. To resolve these issues, the WebGLTile layer renderer needs to be updated to include the necessary logic for handling the gutter option and adjusting for the pixel ratio.
