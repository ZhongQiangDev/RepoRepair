Let me analyze the GitHub issue about the OpenLayers (ol) WebGLTile layer and WMS source compatibility problem.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Image misplacement in the rendered map tiles
**Cause**: The WebGLTile layer renderer is not properly handling the gutter property from the TileWMS source. When creating textures, it's using the full image including the gutter area, which leads to incorrect positioning of tile content.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate content appearing at tile edges
**Cause**: Since the gutter (extra pixels around tile edges) is not being clipped before texture creation, the overlapping areas are being rendered multiple times where tiles meet, causing visible duplication of map features at tile boundaries.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent rendering between WebGLTile and regular Tile layers
**Cause**: The ol/layer/Tile implementation correctly handles the gutter by clipping it before rendering, while the WebGLTile layer lacks this preprocessing step in its rendering pipeline, leading to inconsistent behavior between the two layer types when using the same WMS source.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete implementation of gutter handling in the WebGLTile layer renderer. While the traditional Tile layer properly clips the gutter areas from WMS tiles, the WebGLTile renderer uses the raw tiles with gutters intact, causing three main problems: misplaced imagery, content duplication at tile edges, and inconsistent rendering compared to the standard Tile layer. The solution would require adding proper gutter clipping logic to the WebGLTile renderer, taking into account the pixel ratio when necessary.
