### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The green "3" text style with a non-zero rotation value is not being translated correctly and appears in the original location instead of the translated location.
**Cause**: The rotation transformation applied to the text style is not being correctly accounted for during the clipping and translation process. This could be due to an issue in the way the rotation matrix is being applied or an error in the coordinate transformation logic when the context is clipped and translated.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The green "3" text style only displays correctly when the rotation value is set to 0 or removed.
**Cause**: The rotation value is affecting the coordinate system in a way that interferes with the translation process. This could be due to a bug in the OpenLayers library where the rotation transformation is not being properly integrated with the translation transformation. The rotation might be applied in a coordinate space that is not aligned with the translated space, causing the text to appear in the wrong location.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The non-rotated text styles (blue "1" and red "2") are displayed correctly in the translated location.
**Cause**: The non-rotated text styles do not have the same transformation issues as the rotated text styles. This suggests that the problem is specifically related to the rotation transformation and not a general issue with the clipping and translation process. The non-rotated text styles are likely being transformed correctly because they do not have the additional rotation transformation applied.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the rotation transformation is not being correctly applied during the clipping and translation process, causing the green "3" text style to appear in the wrong location. This is likely due to a bug in the OpenLayers library where the rotation transformation is not being properly integrated with the translation transformation. The non-rotated text styles are displayed correctly because they do not have the additional rotation transformation applied. To fix this issue, the rotation transformation logic needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it is properly integrated with the translation transformation.
