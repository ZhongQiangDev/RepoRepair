Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing meridian lines when the projection crosses the international date line
**Cause**: The projection system likely has difficulty handling the coordinate discontinuity at the date line (180°/-180° longitude). When the view crosses this boundary, the coordinate calculations may fail to properly render meridians that cross this line.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Parallels (latitude lines) either start incorrectly at the date line or extend too far
**Cause**: The proj4 library returns normalized longitudes (between -180° and +180°), which makes it challenging to properly determine where parallel lines should begin and end when the projection crosses the date line. The normalization process may cause incorrect start/end points for parallel lines.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent graticule display on different sides of the date line
**Cause**: The projection system doesn't properly handle the determination of which side of the date line contains the majority of the projection area. This leads to incorrect rendering decisions for the graticule lines.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the handling of the international date line (180°/-180° longitude) in the projection system. The problems manifest in three ways: missing meridian lines, incorrect parallel line extents, and inconsistent graticule display. The root cause appears to be the coordinate normalization in proj4 and the challenges in properly handling the discontinuity at the date line. The solution would require special handling of coordinates near the date line and potentially implementing logic to determine the dominant side of the projection relative to the date line.
