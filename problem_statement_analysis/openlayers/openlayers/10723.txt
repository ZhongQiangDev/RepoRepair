### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Most meridians do not appear when the projection crosses the dateline.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the graticule generation logic does not handle the discontinuity at the dateline (180° longitude) correctly. When the projection spans the dateline, the algorithm fails to properly render meridians that cross this boundary, leading to their absence in the display.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Parallels begin at the dateline and/or extend too far.
**Cause**: The parallels are not correctly clipped or adjusted for the dateline crossing. The algorithm likely assumes a continuous longitude range and does not account for the wrap-around at 180°, causing the parallels to start or end at the dateline inappropriately or extend beyond the intended projection extent.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The graticule does not display all meridians and parallels within the projection extent.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the graticule generation does not dynamically adjust to the specific characteristics of the projection when it crosses the dateline. This results in incomplete rendering of the graticule, as the algorithm fails to correctly determine which meridians and parallels should be displayed within the visible area.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the graticule generation algorithm's inability to handle the discontinuity at the dateline. The absence of meridians, incorrect starting or ending points of parallels, and incomplete display of the graticule within the projection extent are all symptoms of this underlying problem. Addressing these issues will require modifications to the algorithm to properly account for the dateline crossing and ensure accurate rendering of the graticule in all cases.
