### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The application using OpenLayers breaks down or misbehaves when the WebGL context limit is reached.
**Cause**: Browsers have a hard limit on the number of WebGL contexts available (typically 16). When this limit is reached, the browser removes older WebGL contexts to stay within the limit, which can cause the application to malfunction.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The application can only have 16 TileLayers at the same time due to the WebGL context limit.
**Cause**: Each WebGL TileLayer uses one WebGL context. Since browsers have a hard limit on the number of WebGL contexts, this limits the number of TileLayers that can be used simultaneously in an application.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Combining multiple images covering different areas leads to OpenLayers requiring a WebGL context for each distinct dimension and position.
**Cause**: A single GeoTIFFSource can only combine GeoTIFFs that share the same dimension and position. Therefore, when multiple images covering different areas need to be combined, each distinct dimension and position requires a separate WebGL context.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the limitation on the number of WebGL contexts available in browsers, which leads to the application breaking down or misbehaving when the limit is reached. This is caused by each WebGL TileLayer using one WebGL context and the inability of a single GeoTIFFSource to combine GeoTIFFs with different dimensions and positions. To address this issue, it is proposed that WebGL TileLayers within one OpenLayers map share a single WebGL context, which would reduce the likelihood of hitting the 16 context limit.
