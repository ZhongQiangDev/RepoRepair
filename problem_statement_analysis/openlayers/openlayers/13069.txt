### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation does not utilize `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` for normalization when they are available.
**Cause**: The code responsible for normalization does not check for the presence of `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` in the metadata and does not use them as default values for `max` and `min`. Instead, it might be using hardcoded values or other methods to determine the normalization range.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no fallback mechanism in place if `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` are not present in the metadata.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks a conditional check to handle cases where `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` are not available. Without this check, the normalization process might fail or produce incorrect results when these values are missing.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The normalization process might not be consistent across different GeoTIFF sources.
**Cause**: If the normalization process does not consistently use `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` when available, it can lead to inconsistent normalization results across different GeoTIFF sources. This inconsistency can arise from varying default values or methods used for normalization when these statistics are not present.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the current normalization process does not leverage `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` from the GeoTIFF metadata when they are available. This leads to potential inconsistencies in normalization results across different GeoTIFF sources. Additionally, there is a lack of a fallback mechanism for cases where these statistics are not present in the metadata. To address these issues, the normalization code should be updated to check for the presence of `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` and use them as default values for `max` and `min`. Furthermore, a fallback mechanism should be implemented to handle cases where these statistics are not available, ensuring consistent and reliable normalization results.
