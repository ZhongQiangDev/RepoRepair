Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current normalization process doesn't utilize available statistical metadata from the GeoTIFF file
**Cause**: The implementation doesn't check for or use the STATISTICS_MAXIMUM and STATISTICS_MINIMUM values that are available through the getGDALMetadata method, potentially leading to suboptimal normalization results

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Default max/min values for normalization may not accurately represent the actual data range
**Cause**: Without using the statistical metadata, the normalization process might be using arbitrary or less accurate min/max values, which could result in poor contrast or incorrect scaling of the image data

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent normalization across different implementations or uses of the library
**Cause**: The lack of standardized usage of available statistical metadata means different implementations might handle normalization differently, leading to inconsistent results when processing the same GeoTIFF file

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the underutilization of available statistical metadata (STATISTICS_MAXIMUM and STATISTICS_MINIMUM) in the GeoTIFF normalization process. This leads to three key problems: unused valuable metadata, potentially inaccurate normalization ranges, and inconsistent processing results. Implementing the use of these statistical values as default parameters for normalization would improve the accuracy and consistency of the image processing results.
