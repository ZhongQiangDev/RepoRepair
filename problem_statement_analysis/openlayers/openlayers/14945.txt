Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Layer-Map misalignment when computer's zoom/scaling is not at 100%
**Cause**: The default ratio parameter value of 1.5 in ImageArcGISRest interacts poorly with system-level scaling settings. When the system scaling is different from 100%, this mismatch between the default ratio and system scaling creates calculation errors in the layer positioning.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Layer-Map mismatch when using ratio values other than 1 or 1.5
**Cause**: The ImageArcGISRest source appears to have optimization issues with ratio values outside its expected range (1 or 1.5). This suggests the internal calculations for layer positioning and rendering may not properly account for arbitrary ratio values, leading to incorrect scaling or positioning of the layer relative to the base map.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Layer-Map misalignment after map rotation with non-1 ratio values
**Cause**: The rotation transformation calculations in OpenLayers 7.4 may not properly account for the ratio parameter when applying rotational transformations. This indicates a potential mathematical error in how the rotation matrix is applied in combination with the ratio scaling factor.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from the ImageArcGISRest source's ratio parameter implementation in OpenLayers 7.4. The problems manifest in three main scenarios: system scaling conflicts, non-standard ratio values, and rotation transformations. All these issues appear to be related to how the ratio parameter affects the mathematical calculations for layer positioning and transformation. The common workaround of setting the ratio to 1 suggests that the ratio multiplication factor is the root cause of these alignment problems. This points to a need for a comprehensive review of how the ratio parameter is implemented in the ImageArcGISRest source, particularly in its interaction with system scaling, arbitrary ratio values, and rotation transformations.
