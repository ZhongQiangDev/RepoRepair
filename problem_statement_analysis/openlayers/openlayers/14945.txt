### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Layer-Map Mismatch when the computer's zoom or scaling ratio is not 100%.
**Cause**: The default value of the ratio parameter in ImageArcGISRest is set to 1.5, which does not account for different scaling ratios on the user's device. When the device's scaling ratio is not 100%, the layer's dimensions and positioning do not align correctly with the map, leading to a mismatch.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Layer-Map Mismatch after Map Rotation.
**Cause**: The ImageArcGISRest source does not properly handle the transformation of layers when the map is rotated. Even with a ratio value of 1.5 or other values, the layer's coordinates and dimensions do not adjust correctly to the rotated map's orientation, causing misalignment.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent Layer Rendering with Different Ratio Values.
**Cause**: The ImageArcGISRest source is sensitive to the ratio parameter, and values other than 1 or 1.5 can lead to incorrect rendering of the layer. This sensitivity suggests that the source may not be handling the ratio parameter consistently across different values, leading to unpredictable behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are layer-map mismatch due to incorrect handling of the ratio parameter in ImageArcGISRest, especially when the device's scaling ratio is not 100%, and after map rotation. The root causes include the default ratio value not accounting for different scaling ratios, improper handling of layer transformations during map rotation, and inconsistent behavior with different ratio values. The workaround of setting the ratio to 1 addresses these issues but may not be the optimal solution for all use cases. A more comprehensive fix would involve improving the ratio parameter's handling and ensuring consistent layer rendering across different scaling ratios and map orientations.
