Let me analyze this GitHub issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Split/fragmented test organization with tests in two different locations (`rendering` and `test/rendering`)
**Cause**: Inconsistent development practices over time, likely due to:
- Different developers implementing tests in different locations
- Lack of standardized testing guidelines
- Gradual evolution of the codebase without consolidation

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Two different approaches for testing rendering output
**Cause**: Absence of a unified testing methodology, potentially resulting from:
- Different testing requirements for different rendering scenarios
- Historical reasons where new testing approaches were introduced without deprecating old ones
- Lack of consensus on the best testing approach to use

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from having fragmented testing approaches both in terms of location and methodology. This creates maintenance overhead and potential confusion for developers. The root causes appear to be organic growth of the codebase without standardization of testing practices. The solution would involve:
1. Choosing one preferred testing approach
2. Consolidating all tests into a single location
3. Establishing clear testing guidelines for future development

This would improve code organization, maintainability, and developer experience.
