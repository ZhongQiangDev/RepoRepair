Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When decreasing the level on the slider, the pixels don't change color back to their original state
**Cause**: This is likely due to the WebGLTileLayer's style caching mechanism. The style updates are not being properly triggered when the level decreases. The `updateStyleVariables()` method might not be forcing a complete re-render of the layer.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect R value when printing pixel values from clicked locations
**Cause**: The issue appears to be in the data access within the `floodRegion` function. The function is accessing raw RGBA values from the rendered tile layer instead of the actual elevation data from the GeoTIFF. This explains why the printed values don't match the expected elevation values.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Region growing functionality isn't working as expected
**Cause**: The current implementation in `floodRegion` only reads the pixel value but doesn't implement the actual region growing algorithm. It's missing the logic to:
1. Check neighboring pixels
2. Compare their values against the threshold
3. Propagate the selection to connected pixels
4. Update the output image data accordingly

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential data type mismatch in elevation values
**Cause**: The slider operates on values from 0-20 with steps of 0.05, but the GeoTIFF might store elevation data in different units or scale. There's no visible conversion between the slider values and the actual elevation values in the dataset.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around three core areas:
1. Layer rendering and update problems when decreasing elevation levels
2. Incorrect data access for pixel values
3. Incomplete implementation of the region growing algorithm
4. Potential mismatch between input controls and actual data values

To fix these issues, the code would need to:
- Implement proper layer refresh mechanism
- Access the raw elevation data instead of rendered pixels
- Implement a complete region growing algorithm
- Ensure proper data type conversion between UI controls and actual elevation values
