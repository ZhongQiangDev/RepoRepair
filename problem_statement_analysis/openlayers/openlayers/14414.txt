### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When the level is decreased, the pixels that were previously marked as white do not revert to their original state.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the fact that the `FloodStyle` is only applied when the level is increased, but not when it is decreased. The `FloodStyle` uses a `case` statement to check if the band value is less than or equal to the level, but it does not have a mechanism to revert the pixel color when the level is decreased. Additionally, the `raster.changed()` method is not being called when the level is decreased, which means the raster operation is not being re-evaluated.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The R value of a pixel printed in the console is not correct.
**Cause**: The `floodRegion` function is not correctly accessing the pixel data. The `inputData` array is a flat array of RGBA values, and the index calculation for `seedIdx` might be incorrect. The `console.log("Value: " + inputData[seedIdx]);` statement is logging the R value of the pixel, but the index `seedIdx` might be pointing to the wrong position in the `inputData` array. This could be due to an incorrect calculation of the pixel index or an issue with how the pixel data is being accessed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: 
- The first issue is related to the `FloodStyle` not being properly updated when the level is decreased, which can be fixed by ensuring that the `raster.changed()` method is called whenever the level changes, and by updating the `FloodStyle` to handle both increasing and decreasing levels.
- The second issue is related to the incorrect calculation of the pixel index in the `floodRegion` function, which can be fixed by ensuring that the index calculation is correct and that the pixel data is being accessed properly. This might involve reviewing the structure of the `inputData` array and ensuring that the index calculation takes into account the width and height of the image, as well as the RGBA values.
