### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `wrapX` option in GeoTIFF is not cropping the output to the tile grid extent on both the x and y axes when the source is reprojected, even if a non-zero nodata value is specified.
**Cause**: The `wrapX` option is being misinterpreted when the source is reprojected. It is expected to crop the output to the tile grid extent regardless of the source projection being global, but this behavior is not respected when reprojecting. This could be due to the way the reprojection process handles the `wrapX` option, possibly not taking into account the need to crop the output to the tile grid extent.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `wrapX` option's name is misleading, as it is used to crop the output to the tile grid extent on both the x and y axes, which is unrelated to what reprojection expects `wrapX` to mean.
**Cause**: The `wrapX` option's name is not descriptive of its actual function. This can lead to confusion and incorrect usage of the option. Renaming the option to something more appropriate could help clarify its purpose and prevent such issues in the future.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the misinterpretation of the `wrapX` option during reprojection and the misleading name of the option. The `wrapX` option is not cropping the output to the tile grid extent as expected when the source is reprojected, which is likely due to the reprojection process not handling the option correctly. Additionally, the name of the option is misleading, which can cause confusion and incorrect usage. Renaming the option to something more descriptive could help prevent such issues in the future.
