Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Significantly slower pointermove event performance in OpenLayers 6.4.0 compared to 6.3.1
**Cause**: Based on the description and GIFs provided, there appears to be a performance regression in how pointer events are handled in version 6.4.0, particularly noticeable with a large number of features (1000 in the example) using non-cached styles.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Delayed cursor changes in version 6.4.0
**Cause**: The slower pointer event processing is causing cursor state updates to be delayed, suggesting either:
1. Additional processing overhead in the event handling pipeline
2. Less efficient style calculations or rendering in 6.4.0

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Degraded performance in zoom and panning operations
**Cause**: Since pointer events are fundamental to these interactive operations, the slower pointermove event processing is cascading into other map interactions, affecting the overall responsiveness of zoom and pan operations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a significant performance regression in OpenLayers 6.4.0's pointer event handling system. This manifests in three main ways: slower pointermove event processing, delayed cursor updates, and degraded performance in map interactions like zoom and pan. The problem is particularly noticeable when dealing with a large number of features (1000) with non-cached styles. The comparison between versions 6.4.0 and 6.3.1 clearly shows that something in the event handling or style processing pipeline was changed that negatively impacts performance. This suggests a need to investigate changes in the codebase between these versions, particularly focusing on pointer event handling and style processing optimizations.
