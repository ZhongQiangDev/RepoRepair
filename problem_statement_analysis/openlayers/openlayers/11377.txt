### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The performance of the `pointermove` event is significantly slower in version 6.4.0 compared to version 6.3.1 when dealing with 1000 features with non-cached styles.
**Cause**: The slowdown could be due to changes in the event handling or rendering logic in version 6.4.0. Specifically, there might be additional processing or checks introduced in the new version that increase the computational overhead for each `pointermove` event, leading to a noticeable delay in cursor response and overall interaction performance.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The cursor change is much slower in version 6.4.0 compared to version 6.3.1.
**Cause**: This issue might be related to how the cursor style is updated in response to the `pointermove` event. In version 6.4.0, there could be inefficiencies in the way the cursor style is recalculated or applied, possibly due to changes in the style management or event propagation mechanisms. This results in a lag between the actual pointer movement and the visual feedback of the cursor change.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The slowdown affects many operations like zoom and panning in the application.
**Cause**: The performance degradation in `pointermove` events can have a cascading effect on other map interactions such as zooming and panning. If these operations rely on the same event handling or rendering pipeline, they would also suffer from the increased latency introduced in version 6.4.0. This suggests that the underlying issue is not isolated to cursor changes but impacts the overall responsiveness of the map interface.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the reduced performance of the `pointermove` event in version 6.4.0, which affects cursor responsiveness and other map interactions like zooming and panning. The causes likely involve changes in event handling, style management, or rendering logic that introduce additional computational overhead. Addressing these inefficiencies should improve the overall user experience by restoring the responsiveness seen in version 6.3.1.
