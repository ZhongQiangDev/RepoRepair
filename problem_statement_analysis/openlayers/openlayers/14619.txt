### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The scale value of the cloned icon is an array instead of a number.
**Cause**: When the `setScale()` method is called, it sets both the height and width of the icon. When the icon is cloned, the constructor is called again, which sets the scale as an array containing the height and width values. This happens even though the original scale was set as a number.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The cloned icon has a different scale value than the original icon.
**Cause**: The `clone()` method does not preserve the original scale value and its data type. Instead, it sets the scale as an array containing the height and width values, which results in a different scale value.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The documentation states that height and width cannot be used with scale, but the code allows it.
**Cause**: There is a conflict between the documentation and the code. The code allows the use of height and width with scale, which can lead to unexpected behavior and confusion for users.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `clone()` method does not preserve the original scale value and its data type, resulting in a different scale value for the cloned icon. This is caused by the `setScale()` method setting both the height and width of the icon, and the `clone()` method setting the scale as an array containing these values. Additionally, there is a conflict between the documentation and the code, which can lead to confusion for users. To fix these issues, the `clone()` method should preserve the original scale value and its data type, and the code should be updated to match the documentation.
