Let me analyze the problem and provide structured answers.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) layer is not displaying on the map despite the OSM base layer showing correctly.
**Cause**: The main cause is a projection mismatch. The source data is in UTM (EPSG:32636) but the WebGLTile layer is not properly configured to handle the reprojection to EPSG:4326. The `projection` property in the GeoTIFF source is commented out, which means the source projection isn't explicitly specified.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The extent calculation works but the actual raster data doesn't reproject.
**Cause**: The WebGLTile layer in OpenLayers has limitations with on-the-fly reprojection. While the extent can be transformed using `ol.proj.getTransform()`, the WebGLTile layer itself doesn't automatically handle reprojection of raster data from UTM to Web Mercator/WGS84 like regular tile layers might.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The code assumes the WebGLTile layer will handle different projections similarly to regular tile layers.
**Cause**: This is a conceptual misunderstanding. WebGLTile layers in OpenLayers are optimized for performance and typically expect the source data to be in the same projection as the map view. The WebGL rendering pipeline doesn't include automatic reprojection capabilities for performance reasons.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from projection handling in WebGLTile layers. The problems cascade from:
1. Missing explicit projection configuration in the source
2. WebGLTile layer limitations with reprojection
3. Architectural assumptions about WebGL layer capabilities

To fix this, the developer would need to either:
- Ensure the source data is in the same projection as the map view
- Use a different layer type that supports reprojection
- Pre-process the COG to the target projection
- Consider using a server-side solution that can handle the reprojection before serving the tiles
