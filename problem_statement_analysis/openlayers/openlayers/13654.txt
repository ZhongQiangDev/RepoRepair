### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The COG layer does not appear on the map.
**Cause**: The `projection` property is commented out in the `ol.source.GeoTIFF` configuration. This means that the source does not know which projection the COG data is in, and therefore cannot correctly reproject it to the map's projection (EPSG:4326). As a result, the COG layer does not appear on the map.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The COG layer does not appear on the map.
**Cause**: The `WebGLTile` layer is used to display the COG data. However, the `WebGLTile` layer does not support automatic reprojection. This means that even if the `projection` property is set in the `ol.source.GeoTIFF` configuration, the COG data will not be correctly reprojected to the map's projection (EPSG:4326). As a result, the COG layer does not appear on the map.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The COG layer does not appear on the map.
**Cause**: The `view` property of the `ol.Map` is set to use the EPSG:4326 projection, but the COG data is in the EPSG:32636 projection. This means that the COG data needs to be reprojected to the EPSG:4326 projection in order to be displayed correctly on the map. However, the code does not perform this reprojection, so the COG layer does not appear on the map.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The COG layer does not appear on the map because the `projection` property is commented out in the `ol.source.GeoTIFF` configuration, the `WebGLTile` layer does not support automatic reprojection, and the COG data is not reprojected to the map's projection (EPSG:4326). To fix these issues, the `projection` property should be set in the `ol.source.GeoTIFF` configuration, a different layer type that supports automatic reprojection should be used, and the COG data should be reprojected to the map's projection (EPSG:4326).
