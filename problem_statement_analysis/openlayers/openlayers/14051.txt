Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: `layer.getMinZoom()` is being used directly as a tile grid index
**Cause**: The method returns a view zoom level which doesn't directly correspond to tile grid zoom levels. This is an incorrect usage because view zoom levels and tile grid zoom levels operate in different contexts and scales.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential failure to load tiles, especially for sources with small tile grids that are part of a larger view
**Cause**: The mismatch between view zoom levels and tile grid zoom levels can cause the system to look for tiles at incorrect zoom levels, resulting in tiles not being loaded properly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent usage of zoom level handling across the codebase
**Cause**: While the zoom level is handled correctly in layer/Layer.js using proper conversion, it's used incorrectly in renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js without the necessary conversion between view zoom levels and tile grid zoom levels.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the improper direct usage of `layer.getMinZoom()` as a tile grid index. This method returns view zoom levels, which are conceptually different from tile grid zoom levels. The correct approach would be to either remove this code or replace it with proper conversion using either:
1. `tileGrid.getZForResolution()` from `layer.getMaxResolution()`
2. `view.getResolutionForZoom(layer.getMinZoom())`

This conversion is necessary to maintain consistency and ensure proper tile loading, especially in cases involving small tile grids within larger views.
