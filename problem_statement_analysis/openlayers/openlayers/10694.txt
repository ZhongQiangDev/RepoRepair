### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `setOpacity` function of the image in the feature style does not have any effect on the UI in version 6.2.0.
**Cause**: There might be a bug or a change in the implementation of the `setOpacity` function in version 6.2.0 that prevents it from applying the opacity to the feature style as expected. This could be due to a regression in the codebase or a change in the way the opacity is handled internally.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The feature does not blink in version 6.2.0, while it does in version 6.1.1.
**Cause**: The blinking effect is likely achieved by dynamically changing the opacity of the feature style over time. If the `setOpacity` function is not working correctly in version 6.2.0, the opacity changes required for the blinking effect would not be applied, resulting in the feature not blinking.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `setOpacity` function is not working as expected in version 6.2.0, which leads to the feature not blinking. This could be due to a bug or a change in the implementation of the function. To fix this issue, the root cause of the problem needs to be identified and addressed in the codebase. This could involve debugging the `setOpacity` function and ensuring that it correctly applies the opacity to the feature style. Additionally, any changes in the way the opacity is handled internally in version 6.2.0 should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
