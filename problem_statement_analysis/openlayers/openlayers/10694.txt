Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The setOpacity function is not affecting the image opacity in OpenLayers 6.2.0, while it worked correctly in version 6.1.1
**Cause**: This appears to be a regression in OpenLayers 6.2.0 where the opacity setting in the image style is not being properly applied to the rendered feature. The style update mechanism might have been changed or broken in the new version.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The blinking effect (opacity animation) is not visible in version 6.2.0
**Cause**: The opacity property changes are not being recognized by the rendering engine in 6.2.0, suggesting that either:
1. The style update mechanism is not triggering a redraw
2. The opacity value changes are not being propagated to the actual rendering pipeline

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a regression in OpenLayers 6.2.0 affecting the image style opacity functionality. The problem manifests in two ways: the setOpacity function no longer affects the visual appearance of features, and consequently, opacity-based animations (like blinking) no longer work. This suggests a fundamental change or bug in how style updates, particularly opacity changes, are handled in the rendering pipeline of OpenLayers 6.2.0 compared to the working implementation in version 6.1.1.

The fix would likely need to focus on restoring the proper handling of opacity updates in the image style rendering system and ensuring that style changes trigger appropriate redraws of the affected features.
