### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The icons do not maintain the same Y position for their bottom edges when the scale is modified.
**Cause**: The `displacement` property in `ol.style.Icon` is not designed to adjust automatically based on the scale of the icon. The displacement is applied to the icon's position in pixels, and when the scale changes, the icon's size changes, but the displacement remains constant in pixel values. This results in the bottom of the icons not aligning as expected when the scale is altered.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is not clearly documented in the OpenLayers API documentation.
**Cause**: The relationship between `scale` and `displacement` is not explicitly explained in the OpenLayers documentation for `ol.style.Icon`. Users might expect the displacement to be scale-independent or might not understand how to adjust displacement values when scaling icons, leading to confusion and unexpected results.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `displacement` property does not automatically adjust to changes in the `scale` property, causing the bottom edges of the icons to misalign when the scale is modified. This behavior is not clearly documented, which can lead to user confusion. To address this, users need to manually adjust the `displacement` values based on the scale changes, or the library could potentially be updated to provide a more intuitive way to handle icon positioning when scaling. Additionally, improving the documentation to clearly explain the relationship between `scale` and `displacement` would help users understand and manage this behavior more effectively.
