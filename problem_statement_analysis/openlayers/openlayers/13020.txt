### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `WebGLTile` Layer object lacks a `setStyle` method, which prevents users from dynamically changing the visualization of the layer.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the `WebGLTile` Layer object does not include a `setStyle` method. This omission means that users cannot modify the visualization properties of the layer without removing and re-adding it, which can be inefficient and resource-intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets like GeoTIFFs.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users cannot update the visualization of a `WebGLTile` Layer without discarding the already downloaded raster data.
**Cause**: The absence of a `setStyle` method forces users to remove the existing layer and create a new one with the updated visualization settings. This process results in the loss of previously downloaded raster data, leading to unnecessary data re-fetching and increased load times.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The lack of a `setStyle` method limits the flexibility and interactivity of the `WebGLTile` Layer.
**Cause**: Without the ability to dynamically change the visualization, users are restricted in their ability to create interactive and responsive applications. This limitation can hinder the development of applications that require real-time adjustments to the visualization based on user input or other dynamic factors.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the absence of a `setStyle` method in the `WebGLTile` Layer object, which leads to several wrong behaviors. Users cannot dynamically update the visualization without discarding the existing layer and its associated data, resulting in inefficiencies and limitations in flexibility and interactivity. Addressing this issue by implementing a `setStyle` method would significantly enhance the functionality and usability of the `WebGLTile` Layer, allowing for more dynamic and responsive applications.
