### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGlTile layer remains visible even after the visibility of its parent group is set to false.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the visibility propagation mechanism in the WebGlTile layer. Unlike the Tile layer, the WebGlTile layer may not be properly updating its visibility state when the parent group's visibility changes. This could be due to a bug in the WebGlTile layer's implementation or a missing event listener that fails to trigger the necessary updates.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGlTile layer does not respond to the visibility change of its parent group as expected.
**Cause**: The WebGlTile layer might be rendering its tiles independently of the group's visibility state. This could be due to the WebGlTile layer's rendering pipeline not being properly synchronized with the group's visibility changes. The layer might be rendering its tiles based on its own internal state rather than the group's visibility state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGlTile layer's visibility is not consistent with the Tile layer's visibility when the parent group's visibility is changed.
**Cause**: There could be a difference in the implementation of the visibility handling between the WebGlTile layer and the Tile layer. The Tile layer might have a more robust mechanism for handling visibility changes, while the WebGlTile layer might be lacking some of these features. This could be due to the WebGlTile layer being a newer or less mature implementation compared to the Tile layer.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the WebGlTile layer does not properly update its visibility state when the parent group's visibility is changed. This could be due to a bug in the WebGlTile layer's implementation, a missing event listener, or a difference in the visibility handling mechanism compared to the Tile layer. To fix this issue, the WebGlTile layer's visibility propagation mechanism needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure it responds correctly to the parent group's visibility changes. Additionally, the rendering pipeline of the WebGlTile layer should be synchronized with the group's visibility state to ensure consistent behavior.
