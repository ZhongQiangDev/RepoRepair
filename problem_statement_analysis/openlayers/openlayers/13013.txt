### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ol.layer.WebGLTile` layer is not rendering the data loaded with `ol.source.DataTile` correctly, resulting in black tiles.

**Cause**: The issue seems to be related to the tile sizes and the extent provided. The warning message indicates that the WebGL texture upload requires more data than is available. Specifically, the message states that 767 rows plus 770 pixels are needed, but only 767 rows plus 258 pixels are available. This mismatch in the required and available data could be due to incorrect tile sizes or extent values. The tile sizes provided (`[[770, 768], [240, 240], [240, 240], [240, 240]]`) do not align with the extent and the custom tile grid configuration, leading to the WebGL texture upload failure.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message about the WebGL texture upload requiring more data than available.

**Cause**: The warning message suggests a discrepancy between the expected and actual data dimensions. This could be due to a recent change in the OpenLayers codebase, specifically the pull requests mentioned (https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/11532 or https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/12024). These changes might have altered how the WebGL texture is handled or how the tile data is processed, leading to the warning. Additionally, the custom tile grid configuration might not be compatible with the updated WebGLTileLayer implementation, causing the data mismatch.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The black tiles and the WebGL warning are likely caused by a mismatch between the tile sizes, extent, and the custom tile grid configuration. The recent changes in the OpenLayers codebase might have exacerbated this issue. To resolve the problem, the tile sizes and extent should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure they align with the custom tile grid. Additionally, checking the compatibility of the custom tile grid with the updated WebGLTileLayer implementation could help identify and fix the issue.
