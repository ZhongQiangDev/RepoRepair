Let me analyze the problem and break it down according to the format requested.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Attribution text is showing in the info popup even when the parent group layer is set to invisible (visibility: false)
**Cause**: OpenLayers is still processing and displaying attributions from child layers even when their parent group layer is invisible. This happens because the attribution control is likely checking the visibility of individual layers rather than considering the visibility state of their parent group layers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visibility state inheritance between group and child layers isn't working as expected
**Cause**: There appears to be a disconnect in how OpenLayers handles visibility inheritance in its layer hierarchy. While the group layer is set to invisible, the child layer's individual visibility property remains true and continues to contribute its attributions to the attribution control.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Local storage visibility settings might be conflicting with group layer visibility
**Cause**: The code shows that the layer visibility is being managed through localStorage (`localStorage.getItem("budynki sezon-vi")`). This local storage-based visibility management might be operating independently of the group layer visibility settings, causing inconsistent behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from OpenLayers' attribution handling mechanism not properly respecting the group layer visibility hierarchy. This is compounded by potential conflicts between local storage-based visibility management and group layer visibility settings. The attribution control appears to be checking layer visibility at the individual layer level without considering parent group layer states, resulting in attributions being displayed even when they should be hidden due to an invisible parent group layer. A proper fix would need to ensure that attribution visibility respects the complete layer hierarchy and properly inherits visibility states from parent layers.
