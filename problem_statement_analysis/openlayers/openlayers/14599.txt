### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The attributions from the WMS layer are displayed in the info popup even when the group layer is set to invisible.
**Cause**: The `visible` property of the group layer is set to `false`, but the sub-layer within the group layer is still visible. This causes the attributions of the sub-layer to be displayed in the info popup, despite the group layer being invisible. The current implementation does not properly handle the visibility of the group layer when determining whether to display the attributions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The attributions are displayed in the info popup for the "i" icon, even though the group layer is not visible.
**Cause**: The code snippet provided does not include any logic to check the visibility of the group layer before displaying the attributions. As a result, the attributions are displayed regardless of the group layer's visibility status. This could be due to a lack of proper conditional checks in the code that manages the display of attributions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The attributions are displayed in the info popup despite the group layer being set to invisible.
**Cause**: The `TileWMS` source is configured with attributions that are always displayed, regardless of the visibility of the group layer. The attributions are not dynamically updated based on the visibility of the group layer, leading to the attributions being displayed even when the group layer is not visible.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the attributions from the WMS layer are displayed in the info popup even when the group layer is set to invisible. This is caused by the lack of proper handling of the group layer's visibility in the code, the absence of conditional checks to determine whether to display the attributions, and the static configuration of the `TileWMS` source with attributions that are always displayed. To fix this issue, the code should include logic to check the visibility of the group layer before displaying the attributions and dynamically update the attributions based on the visibility status of the group layer.
