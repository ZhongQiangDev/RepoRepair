Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Alpha band values are incorrect (255 instead of 0) for NaN data values
**Cause**: The system is not properly recognizing NaN as a no-data value when generating the alpha band. While the RGB values are correctly showing as NaN, the alpha channel remains fully opaque (255) instead of being transparent (0) for no-data pixels.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Styling functionality is not working
**Cause**: Since the alpha band is not correctly reflecting the no-data values (NaN), the styling system cannot properly distinguish between valid data and no-data pixels, making it impossible to apply correct styling rules.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent handling of NaN no-data value specification
**Cause**: There appears to be a disconnect between how NaN is being specified in different ways (both as a string "nan" in GDAL and as Number.NaN in the Source options), which might be contributing to the improper recognition of no-data values.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the improper handling of NaN as a no-data value in the GeoTIFF implementation. This manifests in three main problems: incorrect alpha band values, non-functional styling capabilities, and inconsistent NaN value handling. The root cause appears to be in how the system processes and recognizes NaN as a no-data value, particularly in the context of alpha band generation. This suggests that the implementation needs to be updated to properly handle NaN no-data values and correctly set alpha band values to 0 for these pixels.
