### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `getData` method returns `[NaN, NaN, NaN, 255]` instead of `[NaN, NaN, NaN, 0]`.
**Cause**: The alpha band is not being correctly set to 0 for pixels with a no-data value of NaN. This could be due to a bug in the GeoTIFF library's handling of NaN as a no-data value, or an issue with how the alpha band is being generated and associated with the no-data value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The styling functionality cannot be used due to the incorrect handling of the no-data value.
**Cause**: The styling functionality likely relies on the correct identification and handling of no-data values. Since the no-data value of NaN is not being correctly recognized, the styling functionality is unable to properly handle these pixels, leading to unexpected results or errors.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the incorrect handling of NaN as a no-data value in the GeoTIFF library. This leads to two main problems: the alpha band is not being set correctly for no-data pixels, and the styling functionality is unable to properly handle these pixels. To fix these issues, the GeoTIFF library needs to be updated to correctly handle NaN as a no-data value, ensuring that the alpha band is set to 0 for these pixels and that the styling functionality can properly handle them.
