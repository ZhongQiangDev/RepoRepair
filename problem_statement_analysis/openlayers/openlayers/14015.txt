### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGL tile layers display incorrect cached textures after calling `setSource()` or changing the view projection.
**Cause**: The cached tile textures are not being invalidated or cleared when the source is replaced or the view projection is changed. This results in the display of outdated textures from the previous source or projection, leading to incorrect visual output.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The cache is not cleared when it is no longer valid, causing the display of incorrect tiles.
**Cause**: The current implementation does not have a mechanism to detect when the cache becomes invalid due to changes in the source or view projection. As a result, the outdated cache continues to be used, leading to the display of incorrect tiles.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the cached tile textures are not being properly invalidated and cleared when the source is replaced or the view projection is changed. This leads to the display of incorrect tiles from the old source or projection. To address this, the implementation needs to include a mechanism to detect when the cache becomes invalid and clear it accordingly. This will ensure that only the correct and up-to-date tiles are displayed, improving the overall functionality and user experience.
