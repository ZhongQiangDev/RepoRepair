### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The WMS image gets blurry when the ratio is not a round integer.
**Cause**: When the ratio is not a round integer, the image scaling process may introduce interpolation artifacts. Interpolation is a method used to estimate values between two known data points, and when the ratio is not a round integer, the interpolation process can cause the image to appear blurry. This is because the image scaling process is trying to fit the image into a new size that is not a simple multiple of the original size, leading to a loss of sharpness.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The WMS image gets blurry when the map width or map height is not even.
**Cause**: When the map width or map height is not even, the image rendering process may not align properly with the pixel grid of the display. This misalignment can cause the image to appear blurry because the image pixels are not perfectly aligned with the display pixels. This can be especially noticeable when the image is scaled or transformed, as the misalignment can cause the image to appear less sharp.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The WMS image gets blurry due to two main causes. The first cause is when the ratio is not a round integer, which leads to interpolation artifacts during the image scaling process. The second cause is when the map width or map height is not even, which can cause the image to misalign with the display pixel grid, leading to a loss of sharpness. To fix these issues, the image scaling process could be modified to use a different interpolation method that preserves sharpness, and the image rendering process could be adjusted to ensure proper alignment with the display pixel grid.
