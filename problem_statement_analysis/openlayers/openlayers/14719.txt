Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WMS image appears blurry when the map ratio is not a round integer
**Cause**: This likely occurs because of pixel interpolation when the browser tries to scale the WMS tiles to fit non-integer ratios. When the image needs to be scaled to dimensions that don't perfectly align with the original pixel grid, the browser applies anti-aliasing which creates the blurry effect.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: WMS image becomes blurry when map width is not even
**Cause**: When the map width is an odd number of pixels, it can cause sub-pixel rendering issues. The WMS tiles might need to be stretched or compressed to fit the container, leading to interpolation and blur. Even-numbered widths allow for perfect pixel alignment.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: WMS image becomes blurry when map height is not even
**Cause**: Similar to the width issue, odd-numbered heights can cause rendering problems. The browser needs to perform anti-aliasing when scaling the image to fit non-even dimensions, resulting in blur. Even heights ensure proper pixel alignment.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The blurriness issues in the WMS image rendering are primarily caused by three dimensional factors: non-integer ratios, odd-numbered widths, and odd-numbered heights. All these scenarios force the browser to perform pixel interpolation and anti-aliasing when scaling or fitting the images, resulting in blur instead of pixel-perfect rendering. The solution would likely involve ensuring that all dimensions and ratios are maintained as even numbers or integer values to achieve proper pixel alignment and sharp image display.
