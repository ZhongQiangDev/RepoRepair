### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The WMTS layer (EPSG:2180) is rotated when using OL 6.3.2-dev.1589843798021 with proj4js 2.6.1 and a Mercator projection.
**Cause**: The issue is likely due to the changes in proj4js 2.6.1, which fixed the interpretation of axis order. This change may have altered the way coordinates are interpreted, causing the WMTS layer to be rotated.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The OSM layer (Mercator) is rotated when using OL 6.3.2-dev.1589843798021 with proj4js 2.6.1 and an EPSG:2180 projection.
**Cause**: Similar to the previous issue, the changes in proj4js 2.6.1 related to axis order interpretation may have caused the OSM layer to be rotated when using an EPSG:2180 projection.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: Both wrong behaviors are likely caused by the changes in proj4js 2.6.1 related to axis order interpretation. These changes may have altered the way coordinates are interpreted, causing layers to be rotated when using certain projections. To fix these issues, it may be necessary to update OpenLayers to a version that is compatible with proj4js 2.6.1 or to modify the code to account for the changes in proj4js.
