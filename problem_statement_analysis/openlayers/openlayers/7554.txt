### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Draw interaction is very slow in OpenLayers 4.6.2 when using `renderMode: 'image'`.
**Cause**: The deprecation of `ol.source.ImageVector` in OpenLayers 4.6.0 might have introduced changes in how the image vector layer is rendered. The new implementation could be less optimized for certain use cases, leading to slower performance when drawing interactions are involved. Additionally, the `renderMode: 'image'` might not be as efficient in the newer version due to changes in the rendering pipeline.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Performance degradation is observed when upgrading from OpenLayers 4.4.2 to 4.6.2.
**Cause**: The upgrade process might have introduced new features or changes in the underlying codebase that are not as performant as the previous version for specific use cases. This could be due to additional overhead introduced by new functionalities, changes in the rendering engine, or modifications in the way the draw interaction is handled.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The draw interaction is significantly slower in the provided CodePen example using OpenLayers 4.6.2.
**Cause**: The specific configuration or setup in the CodePen example might not be optimized for the new version of OpenLayers. There could be settings or parameters that need to be adjusted to achieve better performance. Additionally, the example might be highlighting a bug or an issue in the new version that affects the draw interaction performance.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the slow draw interaction in OpenLayers 4.6.2 when using `renderMode: 'image'`, performance degradation after upgrading from 4.4.2 to 4.6.2, and the slower draw interaction in the provided CodePen example. The causes include changes in the rendering pipeline due to the deprecation of `ol.source.ImageVector`, potential overhead from new features in the upgrade, and possible configuration issues or bugs in the new version. To address these issues, it may be necessary to review the new version's documentation, adjust settings, and potentially report any bugs to the OpenLayers community for further investigation.
