### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Icons are distorted on the `WebGLPoints` layer when `icon-rotate-with-view: true` is used with a non-square viewport.
**Cause**: The distortion likely occurs because the aspect ratio of the viewport is not being taken into account when rotating the icons. When the viewport is non-square, the rotation transformation may cause the icons to stretch or compress along one axis more than the other, leading to distortion. The current implementation of `icon-rotate-with-view` might assume a square viewport, where the aspect ratio is 1:1, and thus does not compensate for the different aspect ratios in non-square viewports.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The icons do not display as expected when the view is rotated.
**Cause**: The rotation of the icons is tied to the view rotation, but the transformation matrix used for this rotation might not be correctly accounting for the non-uniform scaling that occurs in a non-square viewport. This can lead to the icons appearing stretched or skewed. The underlying graphics library or the WebGLPointsLayer implementation might need to adjust the transformation matrix to consider the viewport's aspect ratio during rotation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue cannot be replicated in the current test framework.
**Cause**: The current test framework uses a square viewport, which does not expose the issue. The problem only manifests in non-square viewports, so the test framework needs to be updated to include tests with various viewport aspect ratios to properly identify and address the distortion issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the distortion of icons on the `WebGLPoints` layer when using `icon-rotate-with-view: true` with a non-square viewport. This is caused by the current implementation not accounting for the viewport's aspect ratio during rotation. The transformation matrix used for rotating the icons needs to be adjusted to consider the non-uniform scaling in non-square viewports. Additionally, the test framework should be updated to include tests with non-square viewports to ensure the issue is properly identified and fixed. Addressing these causes will help achieve the expected behavior of displaying icons without distortion.
