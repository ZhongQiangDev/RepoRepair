Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The TileDebug layer's Y coordinates don't match with the TileImage layer's inverted Y coordinates ({-y})
**Cause**: The TileDebug layer is using the standard tile coordinate system (top-left origin) while the TileImage layer is using an inverted Y coordinate system (bottom-left origin). This mismatch occurs because the TileDebug source doesn't natively support the inverted Y coordinate system used in the TileImage configuration.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Network requests don't correspond to the debug tile coordinates
**Cause**: The discrepancy in network requests occurs because the TileImage layer is explicitly configured to use inverted Y coordinates (`{-y}` in the URL template) while the TileDebug layer continues to use the default coordinate system. This results in different Y values being used for the same visual position.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No built-in way to synchronize TileDebug with inverted Y coordinates
**Cause**: The OpenLayers TileDebug source (assuming this is using OpenLayers) doesn't provide a native configuration option to match inverted Y coordinate systems without implementing a custom tilegrid, making it difficult to debug tile layers that use inverted Y coordinates.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a coordinate system mismatch between the TileDebug and TileImage layers. While the TileImage layer is configured to use inverted Y coordinates ({-y}), the TileDebug layer doesn't have a built-in mechanism to match this coordinate system. This results in mismatched debugging information and network requests. The problem is fundamentally about the lack of native support for inverted Y coordinates in the debugging tool, requiring either a custom tilegrid implementation or other workaround to properly debug such tile layers.
