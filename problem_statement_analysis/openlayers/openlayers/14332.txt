Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent stroke width rendering when view rotation approaches 90 and 270 degrees
**Cause**: The vector context handling in tile layers appears to have different scaling behavior compared to vector layers when dealing with extreme rotation angles, specifically affecting how stroke widths are calculated and applied.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect text scaling near 90 and 270-degree rotations
**Cause**: The text rendering system in tile layers' vector context likely uses a different transformation matrix or scaling algorithm compared to vector layers, causing inconsistencies at certain rotation angles.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Reduced geometry precision at specific rotation angles
**Cause**: The coordinate transformation and geometry calculations in tile layers' vector context may be using different precision handling or rounding methods compared to vector layers, becoming more apparent at rotation angles near 90 and 270 degrees.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent rendering between animated flights on tile layers versus vector layers
**Cause**: The Flight Animation example demonstrates that the vector context implementation differs between tile and vector layers, leading to visual inconsistencies when rendering dynamic content (like flight animations) specifically on tile layers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from fundamental differences in how vector contexts are implemented between tile layers and vector layers. The problems become particularly visible at rotation angles near 90 and 270 degrees, affecting three main aspects: stroke width rendering, text scaling, and geometric precision. These inconsistencies are especially noticeable in dynamic animations, as demonstrated in the Flight Animation example. The different behavior suggests that the vector context implementation needs to be standardized between tile and vector layers to ensure consistent rendering across all rotation angles.
