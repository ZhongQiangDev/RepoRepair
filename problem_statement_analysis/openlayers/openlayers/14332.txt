### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect rendering of stroke width, text scale, and geometry precision in the vector context of rotated tile layers.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the way OpenLayers handles transformations and rotations when rendering vector graphics on tile layers. Specifically, the transformations applied to the vector context during rotations of 90 and 270 degrees may not be accurately accounting for the scale and orientation of the graphics, leading to inconsistencies in stroke width, text scale, and geometry precision. This could be due to a bug in the transformation matrix calculations or an issue with how the vector context is being updated during these rotations.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between the vector contexts of tile layers and vector layers.
**Cause**: The inconsistency may be due to differences in how the vector context is implemented for tile layers versus vector layers. Tile layers may have additional constraints or optimizations that affect how the vector context is rendered, especially during rotations. These differences could lead to discrepancies in the expected behavior of the vector context when comparing tile layers to vector layers. Additionally, there may be a lack of synchronization or alignment in the rendering pipelines for the two types of layers, causing the observed inconsistencies.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The problem described involves two main wrong behaviors: incorrect rendering of vector graphics in rotated tile layers and inconsistency between the vector contexts of tile and vector layers. The causes of these behaviors are likely related to issues in the transformation and rendering processes for tile layers, as well as differences in the implementation of the vector context for tile and vector layers. Addressing these causes will require a thorough investigation of the transformation matrix calculations, rendering pipelines, and synchronization between the two types of layers to ensure consistent and accurate rendering of vector graphics in all scenarios.
