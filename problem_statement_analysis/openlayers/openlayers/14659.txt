### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `drawFeature()` function does not work correctly with geographic coordinates when Null Island is not in view.
**Cause**: The extent comparison in the `drawFeature()` function is redundant because it is repeated in the subsequent `drawGeometry` call. This redundancy can lead to unnecessary computations and potential inconsistencies in the rendering process.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The animation is not visible when the map is panned away from Null Island.
**Cause**: The issue lies in the extent comparison within the `drawCircle` function, which needs to be fixed. This incorrect comparison prevents the animation from being visible when Null Island is out of view.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The problem described in the GitHub issue is caused by two main issues. Firstly, there is an incorrect extent comparison in the code that stops `drawFeature()` from working correctly with geographic coordinates when Null Island is not in view. Secondly, the extent comparison within the `drawCircle` function needs to be fixed, as it prevents the animation from being visible when Null Island is out of view. Both of these issues need to be addressed to ensure that the `drawFeature()` function works correctly with geographic coordinates regardless of the map's position.
