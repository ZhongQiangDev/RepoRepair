Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The feature animation disappears when Null Island (coordinates 0,0) is out of view
**Cause**: There appears to be an incorrect extent comparison in the drawFeature() method that prevents rendering when the feature is outside a certain boundary, particularly affecting geographic coordinates near Null Island

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: drawFeature() works differently from setStyle/drawGeometry for the same animation scenario
**Cause**: The extent comparison check in drawFeature() seems to be redundant since drawGeometry() already handles this check, creating inconsistent behavior between the two approaches

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Extent comparison in drawCircle is not working properly
**Cause**: As mentioned in the bug report, the extent comparison logic in drawCircle needs to be fixed, though specific details aren't provided about how it's failing

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around incorrect extent comparison logic in OpenLayers' VectorContext, particularly affecting feature animations with geographic coordinates. The problem manifests in three ways:
1. Features disappear when Null Island is out of view
2. Inconsistent behavior between drawFeature() and setStyle/drawGeometry methods
3. Incorrect extent comparison in drawCircle

The root cause appears to be redundant and incorrect extent comparison checks in the code, with the drawFeature() method implementing unnecessary checks that are already handled by drawGeometry(). This particularly affects features near Null Island (0,0 coordinates), suggesting the extent comparison logic needs to be either removed or fixed to properly handle geographic coordinates across all view states.
