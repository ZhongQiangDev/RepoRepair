Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Circle animation shows visible jitter/stuttering in OpenLayers 6.5, especially noticeable when the circle's diameter is largest at the end of the animation.
**Cause**: The removal of the `snapToPixel` option in OpenLayers 5.2.0 and changes to the default pixel snapping behavior. While the new version claims to handle animation smoothing automatically, it appears the implementation isn't working as effectively as the previous manual control through `snapToPixel: false`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of "accurate" rendering mode control that was previously available in OpenLayers 4.6.5
**Cause**: The architectural change in OpenLayers 5.2.0+ removed explicit control over pixel snapping behavior, replacing it with an automatic system that's supposed to detect animation states and adjust accordingly. This removes fine-grained control that developers previously had over rendering accuracy.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Degradation in animation smoothness compared to previous version
**Cause**: The new automatic pixel snapping system in OpenLayers 6.5 might not be correctly detecting the animation state of the circle, or the threshold for when to apply pixel snapping might not be optimally tuned. This could cause the renderer to incorrectly switch between snapped and unsnapped states during animation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from OpenLayers' architectural change in handling pixel snapping, introduced in version 5.2.0. The removal of the `snapToPixel` option and replacement with an automatic system has led to degraded animation smoothness, particularly visible in circle animations. The automatic detection system doesn't appear to be as effective as the previous manual control, resulting in noticeable jitter. This suggests either a potential bug in the animation state detection or a need for optimization in the new pixel snapping implementation.
