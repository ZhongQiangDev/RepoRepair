### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The red dots (hover effect) are always displayed below the selected feature, regardless of the zIndex setting.
**Cause**: The `ol.select.Interaction` feature in OpenLayers has a default behavior that places the selected feature on top of all other layers. This behavior is controlled internally by the library and may override any custom zIndex settings applied to other layers. The selected feature is rendered in a separate layer managed by the selection interaction, which ensures it is always on top for visibility and interaction purposes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The zIndex property does not seem to affect the layering of the red dots and the selected feature.
**Cause**: The zIndex property in OpenLayers is used to control the stacking order of layers, but it does not affect the rendering order of features within a layer or features managed by interactions like `ol.select.Interaction`. The selection interaction creates a new layer for the selected features, which is rendered on top of all other layers, disregarding the zIndex of other layers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `ol.select.Interaction` feature in OpenLayers is designed to always render selected features on top of all other layers, which overrides any custom zIndex settings. This behavior is intended to ensure that selected features are clearly visible and interactive. To achieve the desired behavior, one might need to customize the selection interaction or explore alternative methods to simulate the hover effect without conflicting with the selection layer's rendering order.
