### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The texts 'Small text' and 'negative offsetX' are aligned at the wrong end.
**Cause**: There might be a regression in the implementation of the `textAlign` property for the values `'start'` and `'end'`. This could be due to a change in the codebase that inadvertently altered the behavior of text alignment. The regression might have been introduced during a recent update or refactor, and it was not caught by the existing tests or was overlooked during the review process.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The reference images of the rendering tests were updated without noticing the alignment issue.
**Cause**: The issue might have been overlooked because the tests were not comprehensive enough to catch the regression. The reference images might not have been thoroughly reviewed, or the changes might have been subtle enough to go unnoticed. Additionally, there could be a lack of automated checks or visual regression tests that would have flagged the discrepancy between the expected and actual text alignment.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem went unnoticed for a long time.
**Cause**: The lack of proper monitoring and continuous integration (CI) checks for visual changes could have contributed to the issue going unnoticed. If the project does not have a robust system for detecting visual regressions, such as automated screenshot comparisons or visual diff tools, it is more likely that subtle changes like text alignment issues will slip through the cracks. Additionally, the team might not have been actively reviewing the rendering tests or might have been focused on other areas of the project.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The problem of incorrect text alignment for the `'start'` and `'end'` values of the `textAlign` property is likely due to a regression in the codebase that was not caught by the existing tests. The issue went unnoticed for a long time because the reference images were updated without thorough review, and there might be a lack of automated checks for visual changes. To prevent similar issues in the future, it is important to have comprehensive tests, regular reviews of rendering tests, and a robust system for detecting visual regressions.
