Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Text elements with `textAlign` set to 'start' or 'end' are being aligned incorrectly, specifically for 'Small text' and 'negative offsetX' text elements.
**Cause**: There appears to be a regression in the handling of `textAlign` property values 'start' and 'end' in the Text style component. This likely occurred during a previous update that went unnoticed until reference images were updated in PR #14928.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue remained undetected for an extended period
**Cause**: The regression testing process might not have been thorough enough to catch text alignment changes, particularly:
1. Lack of specific test cases for 'start' and 'end' text alignment
2. Visual regression tests might not have been properly reviewed or automated

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is a text alignment regression where 'start' and 'end' values for `textAlign` are not working as expected, causing incorrect text positioning. This bug remained hidden due to potential gaps in the testing process. The problem was only discovered during the update of reference images in test case `text-style-linestring-nice`. To prevent similar issues in the future, more robust testing for text alignment properties and better visual regression testing procedures should be implemented.

Note: Without access to the actual code or more detailed information about the specific implementation, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact technical cause of the alignment regression. Additional context about the codebase changes that led to this regression would be helpful for a more detailed analysis.
