Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Vector tile labels do not respect layer group opacity changes when using setOpacity()
**Cause**: There appears to be an inconsistency in how opacity inheritance works specifically for vector tile label rendering. While other properties like fill-color properly inherit opacity from the parent group, the label rendering system seems to bypass or ignore the group-level opacity setting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between vector layers and vector tile layers
**Cause**: The implementation of opacity handling differs between regular vector layers and vector tile layers. Vector layers properly inherit and apply group opacity to all their elements (including labels), while vector tile layers only partially implement this inheritance (working for fills but not labels).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Direct layer opacity changes work while group opacity changes don't
**Cause**: This suggests that the opacity property is properly implemented at the individual layer level for vector tiles, but the parent-child opacity inheritance mechanism is either broken or not properly implemented for the vector tile label rendering pipeline.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from inconsistent opacity inheritance handling in vector tile layers, specifically for labels. While the opacity system works correctly for:
1. Regular vector layers (all elements)
2. Vector tile fill colors
3. Direct opacity changes to vector tile layers

The problem manifests when trying to apply opacity changes at the group level, where vector tile labels fail to inherit and apply the opacity value from their parent group. This points to a potential architectural issue in how vector tile label rendering handles style inheritance from parent groups.
