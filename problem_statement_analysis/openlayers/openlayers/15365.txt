### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The opacity of vector tile labels is not affected when the opacity of the layer group is changed using `setOpacity()`.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from how the vector tile labels are rendered and managed within the layer group. Vector tile layers and their labels might be handled differently in the rendering pipeline compared to other types of layers. The `setOpacity()` method might not be propagating the opacity changes to the labels of vector tile layers within the group, possibly due to a limitation or bug in the rendering engine or the specific implementation of vector tile layers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `fill-color` property behaves correctly when the layer group opacity is changed, but the labels do not.
**Cause**: The `fill-color` property and the label rendering might be using different mechanisms for opacity handling. The `fill-color` property might be directly influenced by the layer's opacity settings, whereas the label rendering might be bypassing these settings or using a different opacity mechanism that isn't affected by the layer group's opacity changes. This discrepancy suggests a possible inconsistency in how different properties and elements within the layer group are managed in terms of opacity.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Changing the opacity of individual layers (`vector` and `vectortile`) directly affects their labels, but changing the group opacity does not affect the `vectortile` labels.
**Cause**: The direct manipulation of individual layer opacity might be handled at a lower level in the rendering pipeline, where the opacity changes are directly applied to all elements of the layer, including labels. However, when the opacity is set at the group level, it might not be propagated correctly to the `vectortile` labels due to the way the group's opacity is applied or due to the specific implementation of vector tile layers. This could be a result of the layer group's opacity settings not being correctly cascaded to all child elements, particularly the labels of vector tile layers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the opacity changes applied to the layer group do not affect the labels of vector tile layers, while they do affect other types of layers and properties like `fill-color`. This discrepancy suggests a problem with how vector tile labels are managed within the layer group's opacity settings. The causes include the different handling of vector tile labels in the rendering pipeline, the inconsistency in opacity propagation between different properties and elements, and the potential limitation or bug in the implementation of vector tile layers within the layer group's opacity settings. Addressing these issues would require a deeper investigation into the rendering engine and the specific implementation of vector tile layers to ensure consistent opacity behavior across all elements within the layer group.
