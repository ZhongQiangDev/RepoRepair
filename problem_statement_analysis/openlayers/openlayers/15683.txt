Let me analyze the GitHub issue description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Vector layer canvas gets cropped/cut off when the map is rotated
**Cause**: Based on the PR mentioned (15652), this appears to be related to canvas sizing calculations not properly accounting for rotation. When the map is rotated, the canvas size isn't being adjusted correctly to accommodate the rotated vector features, resulting in partial rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The polygon rendering is incomplete after rotation
**Cause**: The viewport calculations for the vector layer likely aren't considering the full extent of rotated geometries. The canvas size is probably being calculated based on the non-rotated bounding box, rather than the rotated bounding box which would need to be larger to contain the entire rotated feature.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue specifically appears after OpenLayers version 9.1.0
**Cause**: The changes introduced in PR #15652 likely modified how canvas sizing is handled for vector layers, introducing a regression in rotation handling. This suggests the new implementation doesn't properly account for rotation transformations when calculating required canvas dimensions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper canvas sizing calculations when rotation is applied to the map. The problem was introduced in OpenLayers 9.1.0 through PR #15652, which appears to have changed how vector layer canvases are sized. The main technical causes are:
1. Incorrect canvas dimension calculations during rotation
2. Failure to account for the full extent of rotated geometries
3. Regression in rotation handling due to recent changes in the codebase

The fix would likely require adjusting the canvas sizing logic to properly account for rotation transformations and ensure the canvas is large enough to contain the entire rotated feature.
