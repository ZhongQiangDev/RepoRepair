### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The vector layer canvas is cropped when the map is rotated.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be introduced by the pull request https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/15652. This pull request likely changed the way the canvas size is calculated or rendered when the map is rotated, leading to the canvas not being resized correctly to accommodate the rotated view. The canvas size calculation might not be taking into account the rotation angle, resulting in the canvas being too small to display the entire vector layer.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The polygon is cut off when the map is rotated.
**Cause**: The problem could be related to the rendering process of the vector layer. When the map is rotated, the rendering engine might not be correctly adjusting the position and size of the vector layer elements to fit within the new rotated canvas. This could be due to a bug in the rendering logic that fails to properly transform the coordinates of the vector layer elements based on the rotation angle. As a result, parts of the polygon that should be visible are being cut off.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The two main issues identified are the cropping of the vector layer canvas and the cutting off of the polygon when the map is rotated. Both issues seem to stem from problems introduced by the pull request https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/pull/15652. The canvas size calculation and the rendering logic for vector layers when the map is rotated appear to be the root causes. Addressing these issues will likely involve revisiting the changes made in the pull request and ensuring that the canvas size and rendering logic correctly account for the rotation angle.
