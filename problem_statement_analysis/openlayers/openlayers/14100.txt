### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In version 7.0, tile requests for layers within a LayerGroup are sent sequentially, leading to slower imagery load times.
**Cause**: The change in behavior is likely due to an update in the `ol` or `ol-mapbox-style` package versions. The new version may have altered the way LayerGroups handle tile requests, causing them to be processed one at a time instead of concurrently.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The imagery load times are visibly impacted due to the sequential loading of tiles.
**Cause**: The sequential loading of tiles increases the overall time required to load all the imagery. This is because each tile request must wait for the previous one to complete before it can start, leading to a cumulative delay.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected concurrent loading behavior seen in version 6.1 is not present in version 7.0.
**Cause**: The upgrade from version 6.1 to 7.0 may have introduced changes in the underlying code or configuration that affect how LayerGroups manage tile requests. These changes could include modifications to the request queue, threading, or other performance-related settings.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the change in tile loading behavior from concurrent to sequential after upgrading to version 7.0. This change is likely due to updates in the `ol` or `ol-mapbox-style` packages, which have altered how LayerGroups handle tile requests. The sequential loading leads to slower imagery load times, impacting the user experience. To resolve this, it may be necessary to review the release notes for version 7.0, check for any configuration changes, or seek guidance from the project contributors on how to restore the concurrent loading behavior.
