Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) is only partially displayed, showing only the upper part of the image.
**Cause**: This is likely due to incorrect handling of non-square pixels in the COG. When the pixel aspect ratio isn't 1:1, OpenLayers may not be properly calculating the image extent and transformation, leading to incomplete rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The image display differs between OpenLayers and other GIS tools (QGIS, geotiff.io)
**Cause**: Different GIS tools handle pixel aspect ratios differently. QGIS and geotiff.io appear to correctly account for the pixel dimensions, while the OpenLayers implementation might be assuming square pixels or not properly reading the pixel dimension metadata from the COG.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Possible coordinate system transformation issues
**Cause**: The problem might be related to how OpenLayers is interpreting the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the COG and transforming it to the display projection. If the transformation parameters aren't properly accounting for the pixel dimensions, it could result in partial rendering.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be related to the handling of non-square pixels in the COG format when using OpenLayers. This manifests as incomplete image rendering, showing only the upper portion of the image. The problem is specific to OpenLayers, as other GIS tools (QGIS, geotiff.io) display the image correctly. The solution likely requires adjusting how OpenLayers handles pixel dimensions and coordinate transformations for COG files, ensuring proper interpretation of pixel aspect ratios and correct image extent calculations.
