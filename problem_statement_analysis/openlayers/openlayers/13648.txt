### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Only the upper part of the COG is displayed in the OpenLayers example.
**Cause**: The COG file may have non-square pixels, which can cause issues with rendering in certain software. OpenLayers might not handle non-square pixels correctly, leading to incomplete display.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The COG does not display completely as expected.
**Cause**: There could be a mismatch in the coordinate reference system (CRS) between the COG file and the OpenLayers map. If the CRS is not properly aligned, parts of the image might be clipped or not displayed.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The COG displays correctly in geotiff.io and QGIS but not in OpenLayers.
**Cause**: The rendering engine or configuration in OpenLayers might differ from geotiff.io and QGIS. These differences could include how the software handles image tiling, pixel aspect ratios, or the specific COG format.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the handling of non-square pixels and potential CRS mismatches in OpenLayers. The differences in rendering engines between OpenLayers, geotiff.io, and QGIS also contribute to the incomplete display of the COG. Addressing these factors, such as ensuring proper CRS alignment and configuring OpenLayers to handle non-square pixels, should resolve the problem.
