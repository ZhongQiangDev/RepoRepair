### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The common vertex of both polygons does not move together when dragged.
**Cause**: The `GeometryCollection` is not properly handling the shared vertex between the two polygons. When the vertex is dragged, the modification interaction is only applied to one polygon, leaving the other polygon unaffected.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The shapes become distorted when the common vertex is moved.
**Cause**: The `GeometryCollection` does not maintain the integrity of the shared vertex. As a result, when the vertex is moved, the polygons do not update their shapes in a coordinated manner, leading to distortion.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue lies in the handling of shared vertices within a `GeometryCollection`. The `GeometryCollection` does not properly synchronize the movement of shared vertices between different geometries, leading to inconsistent behavior and shape distortion. To resolve this, the interaction logic needs to be updated to ensure that shared vertices are treated as a single point that affects all connected geometries simultaneously.
