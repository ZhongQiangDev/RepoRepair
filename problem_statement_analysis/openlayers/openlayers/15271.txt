### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current style expressions do not support fetching the `id` property of a feature using the `['get', 'attributeName']` syntax.
**Cause**: The `['get', 'attributeName']` syntax is designed to fetch properties from the `properties` collection of a GeoJSON feature, but the `id` property is not stored in the `properties` collection. Instead, it is stored in the root of the GeoJSON feature object. Therefore, the current implementation of the `['get', 'attributeName']` syntax does not cover the `id` property.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user has to duplicate the `id` property in both the root and the `properties` collection of a GeoJSON feature to use it in style expressions.
**Cause**: Since the `id` property cannot be fetched using the `['get', 'attributeName']` syntax, the user has to manually add the `id` property to the `properties` collection of the GeoJSON feature. This duplication is not ideal and can lead to inconsistencies if the `id` property is updated in one place but not the other.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the current style expressions do not support fetching the `id` property of a GeoJSON feature using the `['get', 'attributeName']` syntax. This leads to the need for duplicating the `id` property in both the root and the `properties` collection of a GeoJSON feature, which can cause inconsistencies. To fix this issue, the `['get', 'attributeName']` syntax should be extended to support fetching the `id` property from the root of the GeoJSON feature object.
