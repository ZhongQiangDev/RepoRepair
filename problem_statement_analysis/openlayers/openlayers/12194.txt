### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The dashed line rendered using Canvas Immediate appears differently compared to the one rendered on the map when viewed on a device with a pixel ratio greater than 1.0. Specifically, the dashes and gaps in the Canvas Immediate line become much shorter in proportion to the line width, leading to a blurred appearance.
**Cause**: The `lineDash` array values are not scaled by the `pixelRatio` when rendering with Canvas Immediate. This means that while the pixel coordinates are correctly scaled, the dash pattern is not, causing the dashes and gaps to appear much shorter relative to the line width. This discrepancy is due to the fact that the `lineDash` values are not automatically adjusted for high device pixel ratios in Canvas Immediate rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The dashed line rendered using Canvas Immediate does not maintain the same visual consistency as the one rendered on the map across different devices with varying pixel ratios.
**Cause**: The `ol.render.toContext()` method, when used for Canvas Immediate rendering, does not automatically scale the `lineDash` values by the `pixelRatio`. This results in a visual inconsistency where the dashed line appears differently on devices with different pixel ratios. The `lineDash` values need to be manually scaled by the `pixelRatio` to ensure consistent rendering across devices.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `lineDash` values are not scaled by the `pixelRatio` when rendering with Canvas Immediate, leading to visual inconsistencies across devices with different pixel ratios. This causes the dashes and gaps in the line to appear much shorter relative to the line width, resulting in a blurred appearance. To fix this, the `lineDash` values need to be manually scaled by the `pixelRatio` when rendering with Canvas Immediate. This ensures that the dashed line maintains the same visual consistency as the one rendered on the map across different devices.
