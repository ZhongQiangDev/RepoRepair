### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Tiles are clipped when the browser is zoomed in.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the `renderMode: 'image'` setting in VectorTile rendering does not properly handle the scaling of tiles when the browser zoom level is changed. This results in tiles being rendered at their original size, leading to clipping when the browser is zoomed in.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The clipping issue does not occur when the browser is at 100% zoom or when using `imageMode: 'hybrid'`.
**Cause**: The `imageMode: 'hybrid'` setting likely adjusts the rendering process to account for browser zoom levels, ensuring that tiles are scaled appropriately. When the browser is at 100% zoom, the original tile sizes match the expected display size, preventing clipping.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem is reproducible only after reloading the URL when the browser is zoomed in.
**Cause**: This suggests that the initial rendering of tiles does not account for the browser's zoom level until a page reload occurs. The reload triggers a re-rendering process that fails to adjust the tile sizes correctly for the zoomed-in browser.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the improper handling of browser zoom levels by the `renderMode: 'image'` setting in VectorTile rendering. This causes tiles to be clipped when the browser is zoomed in. Using `imageMode: 'hybrid'` or keeping the browser at 100% zoom avoids the problem by ensuring tiles are scaled correctly. The need to reload the page to reproduce the issue indicates a potential flaw in the initial rendering process that does not account for the browser's zoom level.
