Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Vector tiles appear clipped/have visible gaps between them when the browser is zoomed (e.g., at 150% zoom)
**Cause**: The rendering mode 'image' for VectorTiles likely doesn't properly account for browser zoom levels when calculating tile boundaries and positioning. This causes misalignment in the pixel calculations between adjacent tiles.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue only manifests after a page reload when browser zoom is active
**Cause**: This suggests the initial tile rendering calculations are affected by the browser's zoom state at page load time. The vector tile rendering engine may be using incorrect initial measurements for the viewport and tile dimensions based on the zoomed browser state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem doesn't occur with renderMode: 'hybrid'
**Cause**: The 'hybrid' mode likely handles pixel calculations differently, possibly using a more flexible rendering approach that better accommodates browser zoom levels. This indicates the issue is specific to how the 'image' renderMode handles scaling and positioning.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue becomes more apparent at higher zoom levels (level 19)
**Cause**: At higher zoom levels, the precision requirements for tile positioning and rendering increase. Any small calculation errors due to browser zoom are magnified, making the gaps between tiles more visible.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be how OpenLayers' VectorTile 'image' renderMode handles browser zoom levels. The rendering engine doesn't properly scale or position tiles when the browser zoom is different from 100%, leading to visible gaps between tiles. This is particularly noticeable after page reload and at higher zoom levels. The fact that 'hybrid' mode works correctly suggests the problem is specific to the image rendering implementation rather than a fundamental limitation of the library.
