### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `WebGLPointsLayer` points are plotted at the wrong locations when `useGeographic()` is enabled.
**Cause**: The `WebGLPointsLayer` does not respect the featureProjection specified at the Vector source (e.g. EPSG:4326) and creates features with geometry in the projection of EPSG:3857. This is likely due to a bug in the `WebGLPointsLayer` implementation that does not properly handle the `useGeographic()` option.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `WebGLPointsLayer` does not work in the same manner as regular `VectorLayer` when `useGeographic()` is enabled.
**Cause**: The `WebGLPointsLayer` implementation may not be compatible with the `useGeographic()` option, which is designed to work with regular `VectorLayer`. This could be due to differences in the way the two layers handle coordinate transformations and projections.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `WebGLPointsLayer` does not properly handle the `useGeographic()` option, resulting in points being plotted at the wrong locations. This is likely due to a bug in the `WebGLPointsLayer` implementation that does not respect the featureProjection specified at the Vector source. Additionally, the `WebGLPointsLayer` may not be compatible with the `useGeographic()` option, which is designed to work with regular `VectorLayer`. To fix these issues, the `WebGLPointsLayer` implementation may need to be updated to properly handle the `useGeographic()` option and coordinate transformations.
