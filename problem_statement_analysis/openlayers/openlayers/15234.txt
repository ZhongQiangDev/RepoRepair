Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGLPointsLayer displays points at incorrect geographic locations (near Africa) when useGeographic() is enabled
**Cause**: The WebGLPointsLayer appears to ignore the featureProjection (EPSG:4326) specified in the Vector source and instead defaults to using EPSG:3857 projection for rendering the geometries. This creates a mismatch between the expected geographic coordinates and the actual rendered positions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: WebGLPointsLayer behaves differently from regular VectorLayer when using useGeographic()
**Cause**: There seems to be an inconsistency in how projection handling is implemented between WebGLPointsLayer and VectorLayer. While VectorLayer properly handles the useGeographic() setting and correctly projects the features, WebGLPointsLayer's internal rendering pipeline may not be properly integrated with OpenLayers' geographic coordinate system support.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from WebGLPointsLayer's projection handling mechanism. The component fails to properly respect the geographic coordinate system (EPSG:4326) when useGeographic() is enabled, leading to incorrect point placement. This creates an inconsistency with regular VectorLayer behavior and suggests there might be missing projection transformation logic in WebGLPointsLayer's implementation. The problem appears to be specifically related to the WebGL rendering pipeline not properly integrating with OpenLayers' geographic coordinate system support.
