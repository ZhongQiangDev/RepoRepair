### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing tiles near the antimeridian.
**Cause**: The stereographic projection used (`stereo-sib`) may not handle the antimeridian correctly. Stereographic projections can have issues with the antimeridian because it is a line where the projection is discontinuous. When tiles cross this line, they may not be rendered correctly, leading to missing tiles.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The size of the black gaps depends on the sizes of source tiles and zoom.
**Cause**: The tiling scheme used by the GeoTIFF source may not align well with the stereographic projection. When the tiles are reprojected, the edges may not match up perfectly, especially near the antimeridian. This misalignment becomes more noticeable at different zoom levels, leading to varying sizes of the black gaps.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Tiles are not rendered correctly after reprojection.
**Cause**: The reprojection process from the original projection of the GeoTIFF to the stereographic projection may introduce errors. These errors can be due to the complexity of the reprojection algorithm, especially when dealing with the antimeridian. The algorithm may not handle the discontinuity well, leading to tiles being skipped or incorrectly rendered.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the stereographic projection's handling of the antimeridian, the alignment of the tiling scheme with the projection, and the reprojection process itself. The stereographic projection's discontinuity at the antimeridian causes tiles to be skipped, while the misalignment of the tiling scheme and errors in the reprojection process lead to varying sizes of the black gaps. To fix these issues, one could consider using a different projection that handles the antimeridian better, adjusting the tiling scheme to better align with the projection, or improving the reprojection algorithm to handle the discontinuity more accurately.
