Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `applyTransform` function returns an extent with NaN values when given an empty extent
**Cause**: When an empty extent (represented by [Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]) is transformed using the EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 projection transform, the Math.tan() function in the transform operation receives Infinity as input, which results in NaN values.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The map.getView().fit() method throws an error when receiving an extent containing NaN values
**Cause**: The fit() method expects valid numerical values for the extent coordinates. When it receives NaN values, it cannot properly calculate the view parameters, leading to an error.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The projection transformation system doesn't properly handle edge cases with empty extents
**Cause**: The `fromEPSG4326` transform function (returned by getTransform('EPSG:4326', 'EPSG:3857')) lacks proper handling for infinite values that represent empty extents in OpenLayers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a chain reaction where empty extents (represented by infinite values) are not properly handled during coordinate system transformation. The transformation from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 involves mathematical operations (specifically Math.tan()) that convert infinite values to NaN. These NaN values then cause the map's fit() method to fail. The problem particularly affects applications that need to handle empty extents while converting between EPSG:4326 (user coordinate system) and EPSG:3857 (tile service coordinate system). A proper solution would need to implement special handling for empty extents during the transformation process.
