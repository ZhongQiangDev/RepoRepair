### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Pixelated edge to the sea when zoomed in the Sea Level example.
**Cause**: The WebGLTile renderer is not respecting the `imageSmoothing: false` setting from the tile source. This setting is necessary to prevent image smoothing from distorting the pixel values, which leads to the pixelated edge. The renderer should pass this setting to the `TileTexture`, which could then use `gl.NEAREST` instead of `gl.LINEAR` for its `gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER` and `gl.TEXTURE_MAX_FILTER` configuration.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Thin lines of "sea" are visible along some contours, especially at 3107 meters.
**Cause**: Image smoothing distorts the pixel values, causing thin lines of "sea" to appear along some contours. This issue is particularly noticeable at certain elevation levels, such as 3107 meters. The `imageSmoothing: false` setting is not being respected, leading to this distortion.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: A row of pixels can appear above the sea when the map is panned, slightly south of the opening extent.
**Cause**: The WebGLTile renderer does not properly handle the `imageSmoothing: false` setting, leading to distortion when the map is panned. This issue is more noticeable with exaggerated sea level values and can be seen in browsers like Chrome and Edge. The renderer should pass the `imageSmoothing` setting to the `TileTexture` to prevent this distortion.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of support for `imageSmoothing` in `DataTile` and `GeoTIFF` sources.
**Cause**: Currently, only `TileImage` sources support the `imageSmoothing` option. There may be scenarios where it is necessary to add support for `DataTile` and `GeoTIFF` sources as well. This lack of support can lead to similar distortion issues in these types of sources.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the WebGLTile renderer is not respecting the `imageSmoothing: false` setting from the tile source, leading to pixelated edges, thin lines of "sea" along contours, and distortion when the map is panned. The renderer should pass this setting to the `TileTexture` to use `gl.NEAREST` instead of `gl.LINEAR` for its texture filters. Additionally, there may be a need to add support for `imageSmoothing` in `DataTile` and `GeoTIFF` sources to prevent similar issues in these types of sources.
