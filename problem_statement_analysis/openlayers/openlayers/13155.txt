Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Pixelated edges appear distorted with visible thin lines of "sea" along some contours, especially at 3107 meters elevation.
**Cause**: The WebGLTile renderer is not respecting the tile source's imageSmoothing setting, causing unwanted interpolation between pixels. The renderer is using gl.LINEAR instead of gl.NEAREST for texture filtering, which creates smooth transitions between pixels rather than maintaining sharp pixel boundaries.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Artifacts appear when panning the map - specifically, a row of pixels appears above sea level near tile boundaries.
**Cause**: The texture filtering settings in the WebGL renderer are causing interpolation at tile boundaries, leading to incorrect pixel values being displayed. This is particularly noticeable when using exaggerated sea level values.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited support for imageSmoothing option across different tile source types.
**Cause**: Currently, only TileImage sources support the imageSmoothing option, while other source types like DataTile and GeoTIFF lack this functionality. This creates inconsistent behavior across different tile source types.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the WebGLTile renderer not properly handling image smoothing settings, leading to three main problems: distorted pixel edges in elevation data, artifacts at tile boundaries during map panning, and limited support for imageSmoothing across different tile source types. The main technical solution would involve implementing proper texture filtering options (gl.NEAREST vs gl.LINEAR) in the TileTexture configuration and extending imageSmoothing support to additional tile source types. This would ensure accurate representation of pixel-based data, especially important for elevation data visualization.
