### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `className` setting in `ol.layer.Heatmap` does not work as expected, and the custom class name is not applied to the heatmap layer.
**Cause**: The `className` property in OpenLayers is not supported for `ol.layer.Heatmap`. This property is typically used for vector layers to apply custom CSS styles, but it does not have the same effect on heatmap layers. The heatmap layer generates a canvas element, and the `className` property does not affect the canvas element's class.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The default class name is not displayed on the page.
**Cause**: Since the `className` property is not supported for heatmap layers, the default class name is not applied either. The heatmap layer generates a canvas element with a default class name, but this class name is not visible or accessible through the `className` property. The canvas element's class name is determined by the OpenLayers library and cannot be customized using the `className` property.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The `className` property does not work for `ol.layer.Heatmap` because it is not supported for heatmap layers. The custom class name is not applied to the heatmap layer, and the default class name is not displayed on the page. To customize the heatmap layer's appearance, you can use other properties and methods provided by the OpenLayers library, such as `style` or `renderer`.
