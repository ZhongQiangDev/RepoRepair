Let me analyze this GitHub issue about GeoTIFF color space conversion.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: GeoTIFF sources with non-RGB color spaces (CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, ICCLab) cannot be automatically converted to RGB
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks an automatic color space conversion option, requiring manual handling of different color spaces

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Developers need to explicitly handle color space conversion for different photometric interpretations
**Cause**: There's no unified/automatic approach to handle various color spaces in GeoTIFF sources, making it more complex for developers to work with different image formats

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The default behavior doesn't automatically optimize color space conversion
**Cause**: The current default settings don't include automatic color space detection and conversion, requiring explicit configuration

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the lack of automatic color space conversion functionality for GeoTIFF sources. The problem manifests in three ways: no automatic RGB conversion for non-RGB color spaces, manual handling requirements for different photometric interpretations, and non-optimal default behavior. The suggestion to add `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option would solve these issues by automatically detecting and converting appropriate color spaces using the `image.readRGB()` method. The proposal also suggests making this automatic conversion the default behavior in a future breaking release for better user experience.
