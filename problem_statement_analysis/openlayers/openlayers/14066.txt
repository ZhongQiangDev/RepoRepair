### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation does not automatically convert GeoTIFF sources with specific photometric interpretations (CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, ICCLab) to RGB when there are 3 samples per pixel.
**Cause**: The absence of a `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option in the current implementation means that users must manually specify the conversion method, which can be inconvenient and error-prone for users who are not familiar with the photometric interpretations of their GeoTIFF sources.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The default setting for `convertToRGB` is not set to `auto`, which could lead to unexpected results for users who expect automatic conversion based on the photometric interpretation of their GeoTIFF sources.
**Cause**: The current default setting for `convertToRGB` may not align with the expectations of users who assume that the system will automatically handle the conversion based on the characteristics of the GeoTIFF source. This can result in users having to manually adjust settings, which can be time-consuming and may lead to incorrect conversions if not done properly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the lack of an `auto` option for `convertToRGB` and the current default setting not being set to `auto`. The absence of the `auto` option can lead to inconvenience and potential errors for users who are not familiar with the photometric interpretations of their GeoTIFF sources. Additionally, the current default setting may not meet user expectations, leading to the need for manual adjustments. Implementing an `auto` option and potentially setting it as the default in a future release could address these issues and improve the user experience.
