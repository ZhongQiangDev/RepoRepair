### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The WebGLTileLayer with a palette style breaks when removed and added back to the map, resulting in a black layer.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the WebGL context is not properly managed when the layer is removed and added back. When the layer is removed, the WebGL textures associated with the palette style are not correctly detached from the WebGL context. When the layer is added back, it tries to bind textures that are no longer valid in the current WebGL context, leading to the `bindTexture: object does not belong to this context` error.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Console warnings/errors appear, indicating issues with WebGL texture binding.
**Cause**: The errors such as `WebGL warning: bindTexture: `tex` is from a different (or lost) WebGL context.` and `WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: bindTexture: object does not belong to this context` occur because the WebGLTileLayer does not properly handle the destruction and recreation of WebGL resources when the layer is removed and added. This results in attempts to use WebGL objects that are no longer valid in the current context, causing the WebGL engine to throw errors.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The layer does not display with the proper style after being added back to the map.
**Cause**: The palette style relies on specific WebGL textures and shaders that are not being correctly reinitialized when the layer is added back to the map. The layer's style configuration is not being properly reset or updated to reflect the new WebGL context, leading to the layer not rendering as expected.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the improper management of WebGL resources when the WebGLTileLayer is removed and added back to the map. The WebGL textures and shaders associated with the palette style are not being correctly detached and reinitialized, leading to invalid WebGL object errors and the layer not rendering properly. To fix this, the WebGLTileLayer should properly handle the destruction and recreation of WebGL resources, ensuring that the palette style is correctly reinitialized when the layer is added back to the map. This would involve properly detaching textures when the layer is removed and reinitializing them when the layer is added, as well as ensuring that the layer's style configuration is correctly updated to reflect the new WebGL context.
