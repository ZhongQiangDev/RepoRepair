### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Additional semitransparent layer appears on top of other layers when using `setFill()` in the style.
**Cause**: The `setFill()` method is being applied to the entire `ol.style.Style` object, which may be causing it to override or add an unintended fill to the VectorTile layer. This could be due to how the `ol.style.Style` object is structured and how it handles fill properties when applied to VectorTile layers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Map flickers on mouse hover when moving the cursor around.
**Cause**: The flickering issue could be related to the way the `setFill()` method is being applied dynamically. When the cursor moves, the style might be recalculated or reapplied, causing a brief visual glitch. This could be exacerbated by the additional layer created by the `setFill()` method, leading to performance issues during rendering.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The fill in the style does not behave as expected and creates an unintended layer.
**Cause**: The `ol.style.Style` object might not be properly handling the fill property for VectorTile layers. The `fill` property in the style object is intended to fill the entire feature, but it seems to be creating an additional layer instead. This could be a bug in the OpenLayers library or a misuse of the `fill` property in the context of VectorTile layers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the creation of an unintended semitransparent layer and map flickering on mouse hover. These behaviors are likely caused by how the `setFill()` method is applied to the `ol.style.Style` object and how the `fill` property is handled for VectorTile layers. The `setFill()` method seems to be adding an additional layer instead of simply filling the VectorTile, and this additional layer could be causing performance issues during rendering. To resolve these issues, it may be necessary to adjust how the `fill` property is applied or to use a different approach for styling VectorTile layers in OpenLayers.
