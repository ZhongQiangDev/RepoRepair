Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Additional semi-transparent layer appearing on top of other layers when using setFill()
**Cause**: The VectorTile layer is likely rendering the fill style twice - once for the actual geometry and once as an overlay. This could be due to how the style's fill property is being interpreted in the vector rendering mode.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Map flickering on mouse hover when moving the cursor around
**Cause**: The semi-transparent fill combined with the vector rendering mode is likely causing continuous re-renders of the tiles. Each hover event might be triggering a redraw of the affected tiles, and with transparency involved, this creates a visible flickering effect.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Style behavior differs when fill is removed vs. when it's present
**Cause**: This suggests that the fill property in the style configuration is being handled differently than other style properties (stroke, text) in the VectorTile layer implementation. The rendering pipeline might be treating fill as a special case, possibly due to how vector tiles handle fill styles in the 'vector' renderMode.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be related to how OpenLayers 9.1.0 handles fill styles specifically for VectorTile layers. The problems manifest in three ways: unwanted additional transparent layers, hover-related flickering, and inconsistent behavior between filled and unfilled styles. These issues seem to be interconnected and likely stem from how the vector tile rendering pipeline processes fill styles, particularly in vector render mode. The transparency in the fill color (rgba with alpha channel) appears to be a key factor in triggering these behaviors.
