### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Vector layers with a background cannot be rendered over other layers.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be related to the changes introduced in the 6.10 release, specifically in the commit #13085. The error trace indicates an assertion failure in the `fromStringInternal_` function, which is likely related to the handling of vector layer rendering when a background is present. This suggests that the rendering logic for vector layers with backgrounds may have been inadvertently altered or broken in the update, causing the assertion to fail when attempting to render the Mapbox vector layer over the OSM layer.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The same issue occurs with all vector layers, not just Mapbox vector layers.
**Cause**: The commit #13178 seems to have further generalized the issue, affecting all vector layers. This indicates that the problem is not specific to the Mapbox vector layer but rather a broader issue with the rendering of vector layers in general. The cause could be a change in the rendering pipeline or the way vector layers are composited with other layers, leading to the assertion failure seen in the error trace. This suggests a more fundamental issue in the rendering engine that needs to be addressed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The problem described in the GitHub issue is primarily due to changes introduced in the 6.10 release, specifically in commits #13085 and #13178. These changes have led to an assertion failure when rendering vector layers with backgrounds over other layers, affecting both Mapbox vector layers and all vector layers in general. The root cause appears to be related to the rendering logic and the way vector layers are composited with other layers, which needs to be investigated and fixed to restore the expected behavior of rendering vector layers over other layers.
