Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Vector layers with background cannot be rendered over other layers (specifically when trying to render a Mapbox vector layer over an OSM layer)
**Cause**: The error trace shows an assertion failure in the OpenLayers code, specifically in the `useContainer` method of `CanvasVectorLayerRenderer`. This suggests there's a fundamental issue with the layer composition logic when vector layers with backgrounds are involved.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue affects not just Mapbox vector layers but all vector layers with backgrounds (as mentioned in #13178)
**Cause**: This indicates a broader architectural problem in how OpenLayers handles layer ordering and background rendering for vector layers. The fact that it started occurring after release 6.10 (since #13085) suggests a regression was introduced in the layer rendering pipeline.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error occurs during the render frame process
**Cause**: The stack trace shows the error happens in the rendering pipeline, specifically:
1. During the `renderFrame` method of `CanvasVectorLayerRenderer`
2. When trying to use the container for rendering (`useContainer` method)
3. While processing string-based assertions (`fromStringInternal_`)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a regression introduced in OpenLayers 6.10 that affects the rendering of vector layers with backgrounds when placed above other layers. The problem is not limited to Mapbox vector layers but affects all vector layers with backgrounds. The root cause appears to be in the layer composition logic, specifically in how the renderer handles container management and layer ordering when backgrounds are present. The assertion failure suggests there might be invalid assumptions in the code about layer ordering or container state when dealing with vector layers that have backgrounds.
