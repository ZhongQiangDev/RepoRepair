### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `VectorLayer` with `declutter` and `opacity` < 1 does not clear between renders.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from a change in the rendering logic in the `9.1.1-dev.1714573976514` version. When `declutter` is enabled and `opacity` is set to a value less than 1, the rendering process may not properly clear the previous frame before drawing the new one. This could be due to a bug in the way the canvas is being cleared or how the opacity is being applied during the rendering process. The combination of `declutter` and `opacity` might be causing the renderer to skip the clearing step, leading to the observed behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The layer rerenders with no clearing of the previous frame when panning the map.
**Cause**: This behavior could be caused by an issue in the event handling or the rendering pipeline. When the map is panned, the `VectorLayer` should ideally clear the previous content and redraw the new content. However, if there is a bug in the event listener for panning or in the rendering pipeline, the clearing step might be skipped. This could be related to how the `declutter` and `opacity` properties interact with the rendering pipeline, causing the previous frame to persist and overlap with the new frame.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `VectorLayer` with `declutter` and `opacity` < 1 does not clear between renders, leading to overlapping frames when the map is panned. The cause of this issue is likely a bug in the rendering logic introduced in the `9.1.1-dev.1714573976514` version, where the combination of `declutter` and `opacity` properties causes the renderer to skip the clearing step. Additionally, there might be an issue in the event handling or rendering pipeline that fails to properly clear the previous frame when the map is panned. Addressing these issues in the rendering logic and event handling should resolve the problem.
