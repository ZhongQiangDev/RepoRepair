### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: There is an unwanted gap between two lines of text in the label feature in OpenLayers v4.6.4.
**Cause**: The default line-height or spacing between lines in the `ol.style.Text` class might have been altered or not configurable in the newer version of OpenLayers. This could be due to changes in the CSS or the rendering engine used by the library.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text styling in the label looks better in OpenLayers v2.13 compared to v4.6.4.
**Cause**: The text rendering engine or the default styling properties for text labels might have been updated or changed in the newer version. This could include changes in font size, line-height, or other text formatting properties that affect the appearance of multi-line text labels.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user cannot find an option to remove the space between two lines of text in the label feature.
**Cause**: The API documentation or the available configuration options for `ol.style.Text` might not explicitly mention a way to control the line spacing. This could be due to a lack of documentation or the absence of a specific property to adjust line spacing in the current version of the library.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the unwanted gap between two lines of text in the label feature in OpenLayers v4.6.4, which was not present in v2.13. This could be due to changes in the default line-height or spacing between lines in the `ol.style.Text` class, updates to the text rendering engine, or a lack of documentation on how to control line spacing. To address this issue, the user may need to explore the library code or seek additional configuration options to adjust the line spacing as needed.
