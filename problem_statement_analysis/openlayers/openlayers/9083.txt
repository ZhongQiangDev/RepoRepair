Let me analyze the problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Map becomes undraggable after completing (drawend) a polygon drawing operation
**Cause**: This appears to be a potential event handling or interaction conflict in OpenLayers 5.3.0 where the drag interaction might not be properly re-enabled or reset after the draw interaction completes. The fact that it works in version 4.6.5 suggests this could be a regression bug introduced in version 5.x.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent/random behavior where map dragging sometimes works and sometimes doesn't after drawing
**Cause**: This inconsistency suggests there might be a race condition or state management issue in the interaction handlers. The altKeyOnly condition combined with the draw interaction might be creating an edge case where the event listeners or interaction states aren't properly synchronized.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Issue only occurs after drawend, not during active drawing
**Cause**: The problem being tied specifically to the drawend event indicates that the cleanup or state reset procedures after completing a drawing operation aren't working correctly. This could be related to how OpenLayers 5.3.0 handles the transition between different interaction states or how it manages the activation/deactivation of different interaction types.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a bug in OpenLayers 5.3.0's interaction handling system, specifically affecting the transition between draw and drag interactions. The problem manifests in three main ways: complete loss of drag functionality, inconsistent behavior, and specific timing related to drawend events. The root cause likely lies in how version 5.3.0 manages interaction states and event handlers, particularly during the transition from drawing to normal map interaction modes. The fact that rolling back to version 4.6.5 resolves the issue confirms this is likely a regression bug introduced in version 5.x.
