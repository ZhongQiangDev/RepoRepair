### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The map cannot be dragged after completing the drawing of a polygon.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be related to the version of OpenLayers being used. The user mentions that the problem does not occur in OpenLayers 4.6.5, indicating that there might be a bug or a change in behavior in OpenLayers 5.3.0 that affects the interaction between the drawing and dragging functionalities. Specifically, the `altKeyOnly` condition might be causing conflicts with the map's dragging functionality after the drawing is completed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The map can sometimes be dragged, but this behavior is inconsistent.
**Cause**: The inconsistency in the map's dragging functionality could be due to the way the `drawend` event is handled. There might be a race condition or an event listener that is not properly removed or reset after the drawing is completed. This could lead to the map being locked in a state where dragging is not possible until some other interaction occurs.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is related to the version of OpenLayers, where OpenLayers 5.3.0 introduces a bug or change that affects the interaction between drawing and dragging functionalities. The `altKeyOnly` condition might be contributing to this problem. Additionally, there could be an issue with how the `drawend` event is managed, leading to inconsistent dragging behavior. Rolling back to OpenLayers 4.6.5 resolves the issue, indicating that the problem is version-specific. Further investigation into the event handling and interaction conditions in OpenLayers 5.3.0 might be necessary to resolve the issue without downgrading the library.
