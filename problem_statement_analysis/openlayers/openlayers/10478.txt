### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: White areas appear on the map when zooming in and out or panning around.
**Cause**: The underlying Tile object has been disposed and is excluded from the stitching process to make the source canvas for the reprojection. This results in missing pieces of the map.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Modifying the loop in `ol.reproj.Tile` to include tiles in the ABORT state does not resolve the issue.
**Cause**: Including tiles in the ABORT state causes problems later on, indicating that simply re-including these tiles is not a viable solution. This suggests that the root cause lies in the disposal of these tiles or the lack of a mechanism to refetch them.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The map does not display the expected continuous and complete tile layer.
**Cause**: The disposal of tiles leads to gaps in the map display. The system does not have a mechanism to automatically refetch or re-render these tiles when they are needed again after disposal.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the disposal of tile objects, which leads to white areas on the map when zooming or panning. Attempts to include tiles in the ABORT state have not been successful, indicating that a more comprehensive solution is needed. This could involve preventing the disposal of necessary tiles or implementing a mechanism to refetch and re-render them when they are needed. The current disposal process disrupts the continuity of the map display, and addressing this will ensure a seamless user experience.
