### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The labels on the graticule show irregular intervals such as 3', 3'.01", and 2'.59", which appear inconsistent and destabilizing.
**Cause**: This irregularity could be due to rounding errors in the calculations used to determine the label positions. When converting between degrees, minutes, and seconds, small rounding errors can accumulate, leading to slight variations in the intervals displayed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The grid lines appear regular, but the labels do not match the expected regular intervals.
**Cause**: The grid lines are likely generated based on a consistent interval in the underlying coordinate system, but the labels are derived from a different calculation or rounding process. This discrepancy can cause the labels to not align perfectly with the grid lines, leading to the observed irregular intervals.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The labels seem to be inconsistent with the expected regular intervals of the graticule.
**Cause**: The code responsible for generating the labels might not be correctly configured to ensure consistent intervals. This could be due to an issue in the logic that determines where to place the labels or in the formatting of the labels themselves.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the irregular intervals in the labels and the inconsistency between the grid lines and the labels. These problems are likely caused by rounding errors in the calculations, discrepancies between the grid generation and label placement logic, and potential issues in the code configuration for label generation. Addressing these causes could involve refining the rounding process, ensuring consistent logic for grid and label generation, and reviewing the code to ensure proper configuration.
