Let me analyze the problem and break down the behaviors and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The graticule labels show irregular intervals (3', 3'.01'', 2'.59'') while the grid lines appear to be regularly spaced
**Cause**: This is likely due to:
1. Coordinate system conversion and projection distortions when converting between geographic (lat/long) and projected coordinates
2. Rounding effects in the label formatting/display process
3. The actual mathematical calculations maintaining precise values while the display format shows rounded numbers

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual inconsistency between grid spacing and label values creates confusion for users
**Cause**: The OpenLayers graticule implementation may be:
1. Drawing grid lines at regular screen/projection intervals
2. Calculating actual geographic coordinates for labels independently
3. Not synchronizing the visual grid spacing with exact coordinate intervals

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Labels don't maintain consistent decimal places or formatting
**Cause**: The label formatting system is:
1. Using default number formatting without enforcing consistent decimal places
2. Not rounding to a specific precision that would make the intervals appear more regular
3. Displaying raw calculated values rather than normalized ones

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the interaction between three systems: the visual grid rendering, coordinate calculations, and label formatting. The graticule appears visually regular because it's drawn at regular screen intervals, but the actual geographic coordinates don't perfectly align with these intervals due to projection mathematics and coordinate system conversions. The labels show the true calculated values, but their inconsistent formatting makes the irregularity more apparent. This could be improved by either:
1. Enforcing consistent label rounding/formatting
2. Adjusting the grid to align with exact coordinate intervals
3. Better synchronizing the visual and mathematical aspects of the graticule system
