### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation of the gutter option is only supported by TileWMS, which limits its use for other tile sources like Nextzen and Mapbox.
**Cause**: The codebase for handling tile sources is not generalized to include a gutter option for all tile types. This limitation arises from the specific implementation of the TileWMS class, which includes the gutter logic, while other tile source classes (XYZ and DataTile) do not have this feature.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Edge effects are visible when interpolating tiles, particularly in WebGL tile layers, even when a gutter is specified.
**Cause**: The current handling of the gutter in WebGL tile layers removes the gutter before creating the texture, which does not effectively prevent edge effects. This is because the texture creation process does not account for the gutter, leading to visual artifacts at tile boundaries.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The edge effect is noticeable where DataTiles join, but not where layer extents meet.
**Cause**: The handling of gutters is inconsistent between different types of layers. For layer extents, the gutter is managed correctly, ensuring smooth transitions. However, for DataTiles, the gutter is not handled in the same way, leading to visible edge effects.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the limited support for the gutter option in tile sources other than TileWMS, the ineffective handling of gutters in WebGL tile layers, and inconsistent management of gutters across different layer types. These problems stem from the specific implementation details of the tile source classes and the texture creation process in WebGL. Addressing these issues requires generalizing the gutter option for all tile sources, revising the WebGL texture creation process to properly handle gutters, and ensuring consistent gutter management across all layer types.
