### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Hit detection does not work when the scale is negative and the rotation is 0.
**Cause**: The hit detection algorithm likely assumes a positive scale for calculating the hit area. When the scale is negative, the algorithm may incorrectly interpret the hit area, leading to no detection. This could be due to the way the bounding box or hit area is calculated, which might not account for negative scaling.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The icon is not rendered at the edge of the map when the scale is negative and the rotation is 0.
**Cause**: The rendering engine might be clipping the icon based on its original position and size, without accounting for the negative scale. Negative scaling can flip the icon, and if the engine does not handle this correctly, parts of the icon that should be visible might be clipped out, especially when the icon is near the edge of the map.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The icon disappears instead of getting cut off at the edge of the map.
**Cause**: The clipping logic in the rendering engine might not handle negative scales properly. When an icon is scaled negatively, the engine might incorrectly determine that the entire icon is outside the map bounds and thus clip it entirely, rather than rendering the part that should be visible.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from the rendering and hit detection algorithms not properly handling negative scales. The hit detection fails because it likely assumes positive scaling, leading to incorrect hit area calculations. The rendering issues arise from clipping logic that does not account for the effects of negative scaling, causing the icon to disappear instead of being partially rendered at the map edge. Addressing these issues would require modifications to both the hit detection and rendering algorithms to correctly handle negative scales.
