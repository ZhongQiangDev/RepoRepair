Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes for the CascaderSelect component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Search results remain displayed even after all items have been selected
**Cause**: The component lacks an automatic clearing mechanism for the search input and results after all matching items have been selected

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users cannot easily return to the full list view
**Cause**: There is no direct way (like a clear button) to clear the search and return to the main cascader view. The only current solution is to click outside and reopen the dropdown.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor user experience in understanding next steps
**Cause**: The interface doesn't provide clear visual feedback or guidance on how to proceed when all searched items are selected, leaving users confused about the next action

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of search reset functionality
**Cause**: The component is missing a dedicated clear/reset button for the search functionality, which would allow users to quickly clear their search and return to the full list view

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues with the CascaderSelect component center around search result management and user interaction flow. The component needs:
1. An automatic mechanism to clear search results after all items are selected
2. A clear visual way to reset the search state
3. Better user guidance for post-selection actions
4. A dedicated clear button for search results

These improvements would significantly enhance the user experience by providing clearer pathways for users to navigate between searched and full list views, and better feedback after selections are made.
