### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The custom header cell with the "全选" (Select All) checkbox does not seem to be functioning as expected. The checkbox in the header is checked, but not all the checkboxes in the rows below are checked.
**Cause**: This could be due to a missing or incorrect implementation of the "Select All" functionality in the custom header cell. The checkbox in the header might not be properly linked to the checkboxes in the rows, or there might be an issue with the event handling for the "Select All" checkbox.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The "设置前（当前值）" column shows some values as "未设置" (Not Set) or "空字符串" (Empty String), which might not be the expected behavior.
**Cause**: This could be due to the data source not being properly initialized or updated. The values in the "设置前（当前值）" column might not be correctly fetched or displayed, leading to the "未设置" or "空字符串" values.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the malfunctioning "Select All" checkbox in the custom header cell and the unexpected "未设置" or "空字符串" values in the "设置前（当前值）" column. The causes for these issues are likely related to missing or incorrect implementation of the "Select All" functionality and improper data initialization or display. Addressing these causes should resolve the wrong behaviors observed.
