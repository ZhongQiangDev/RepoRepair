### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The close button is overlapping with the text content when there is no title in the dialog.
**Cause**: The CSS styles for the close button are not properly adjusted to account for the absence of a title. The positioning of the close button is likely hardcoded or not dynamically adjusted based on the presence or absence of the title.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout of the dialog content is not responsive to the absence of the title.
**Cause**: The layout logic for the dialog component does not handle the scenario where the title is missing. This could be due to missing conditional rendering logic or incorrect padding/margin settings that assume the presence of a title.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The close button is not visually aligned with the rest of the dialog content.
**Cause**: The alignment styles for the close button are not properly set to ensure it remains in a consistent position relative to the dialog content. This could be due to missing or incorrect CSS rules for alignment when the title is absent.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the dialog component's inability to dynamically adjust its layout and styles when a title is not present. The close button's position and the overall layout need to be conditionally adjusted based on the presence or absence of the title. This can be addressed by adding conditional rendering logic and ensuring the CSS styles are flexible enough to handle both scenarios.
