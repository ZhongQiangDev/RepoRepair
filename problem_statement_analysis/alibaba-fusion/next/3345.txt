Let me analyze the Dialog component issue based on the provided screenshot and code:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The close button (X) in the dialog overlaps with the content text when there is no title in the dialog
**Cause**: This is likely due to incorrect CSS positioning of the close button. When there's no title, the close button's absolute positioning might not have the proper top margin or padding, causing it to overlap with the main content area of the dialog.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The dialog layout appears unbalanced without a title
**Cause**: The dialog component's layout structure may be optimized for having a title section. When the title prop is empty or not provided, the component doesn't properly adjust its internal spacing and layout calculations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Content padding/margin seems inconsistent
**Cause**: The dialog's content area doesn't have proper padding or margin rules when rendered without a title. The CSS rules might be dependent on the presence of a title element to maintain proper spacing.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around the Dialog component's layout handling when no title is present. The problems stem from:
1. Improper close button positioning logic that doesn't account for titleless scenarios
2. Layout structure that assumes the presence of a title
3. Insufficient content padding/margin rules for titleless dialogs

To fix these issues, the component needs:
- Revised close button positioning logic that works with or without a title
- Updated layout calculations that properly handle both titled and titleless cases
- Consistent content padding/margin rules regardless of title presence
