### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `useLabelForErrorMessage` API does not work as expected when the business layer adds additional DOM structure.
**Cause**: The `useLabelForErrorMessage` API relies on a specific DOM structure to function correctly. When the business layer wraps the label with additional elements (like a `<span>` in the provided code), it disrupts the expected DOM structure, causing the API to fail.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation lacks a way to explicitly set the label for error messages.
**Cause**: The existing `useLabelForErrorMessage` API does not provide a direct way to specify the label for error messages when the label structure is customized. This limitation forces developers to either modify the existing structure or request a new API like `errorMessageLabel` to handle custom label scenarios.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `useLabelForErrorMessage` API is sensitive to the DOM structure, and any additional elements introduced by the business layer can cause it to fail. To address this, a new API like `errorMessageLabel` is proposed to allow explicit control over the label used for error messages, ensuring compatibility with custom label structures. This solution would provide developers with more flexibility in customizing the form component while maintaining the functionality of error message labeling.
