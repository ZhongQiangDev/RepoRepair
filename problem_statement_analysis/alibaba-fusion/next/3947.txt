Let me analyze the problem and provide structured answers:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `useLabelForErrorMessage` API is not working as expected when business layer adds custom DOM structure
**Cause**: In the code, BizFormItem component wraps the label with additional `<span>` tags and icon elements, which breaks the direct relationship between the label and error message that `useLabelForErrorMessage` expects to establish.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No way to customize error message label separately from form label
**Cause**: The current API only uses the form label for error messages through `useLabelForErrorMessage`, but doesn't provide a way to specify a different label text specifically for error messages. This becomes problematic when the form label contains additional HTML elements (like the help icon in this case).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent error message display with custom form item implementations
**Cause**: The business layer's custom implementation (BizFormItem) adds complexity to the DOM structure but doesn't have proper API support to maintain the error message functionality that exists in the base FormItem component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the conflict between custom form item implementations and the built-in error message functionality. The current `useLabelForErrorMessage` API doesn't account for complex label structures that business components might need. The solution requires:

1. Adding a new `errorMessageLabel` API to allow separate specification of error message labels
2. Making the error message system more flexible to work with custom DOM structures
3. Ensuring backward compatibility while supporting both simple and complex form label implementations

The proposed enhancement to add a `getLabel` API would help resolve these issues by providing more control over how labels are used in error messages, especially in cases where the form label contains additional HTML elements or styling.
