Let me analyze the problem with the NumberPicker component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker displays 4.029999 instead of 4.03 when incrementing from 4.02 by 0.01
**Cause**: This is caused by JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic precision limitation. JavaScript uses 64-bit floating-point numbers (IEEE 754), which can't precisely represent some decimal fractions. When performing arithmetic with decimals (like 4.02 + 0.01), it can result in small rounding errors.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The precision prop is not properly handling the floating-point rounding
**Cause**: Even though the precision prop is set to 2 decimal places, the component is displaying the raw floating-point calculation result instead of rounding it to the specified precision before display.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is specifically noticeable in Safari browser
**Cause**: While floating-point arithmetic is a JavaScript language feature that affects all browsers, Safari might be handling the number-to-string conversion differently than other browsers, making the issue more visible.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from JavaScript's inherent floating-point precision limitations, which causes 4.02 + 0.01 to evaluate to 4.029999999999999 instead of 4.03. This is exacerbated by:
1. The NumberPicker component not properly rounding the result to the specified precision before display
2. Safari's number formatting behavior making the issue more apparent

To fix this, the component should:
- Implement proper rounding to the specified precision after calculations
- Consider using a decimal arithmetic library for precise calculations
- Ensure consistent number formatting across all browsers
