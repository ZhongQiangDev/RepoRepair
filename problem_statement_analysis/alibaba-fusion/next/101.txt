### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker displays `4.029999999999999` instead of `4.03` when the `+` button is clicked.
**Cause**: This issue arises due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript. When adding `4.02` and `0.01`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary. This leads to a small rounding error, resulting in `4.029999999999999`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker does not round the result to the specified precision (2 decimal places) as expected.
**Cause**: The NumberPicker component may not be correctly implementing rounding logic to handle the precision specified. Even though the `precision` prop is set to `2`, the component might not be rounding the result to two decimal places after the addition operation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inherent inaccuracy of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript, which causes the result of `4.02 + 0.01` to be `4.029999999999999` instead of `4.03`. Additionally, the NumberPicker component may not be correctly rounding the result to the specified precision. To fix this, the component should implement proper rounding logic to ensure that the displayed value is rounded to the correct number of decimal places. This can be achieved by using methods like `toFixed()` or `Math.round()` in combination with appropriate scaling to handle the precision.
