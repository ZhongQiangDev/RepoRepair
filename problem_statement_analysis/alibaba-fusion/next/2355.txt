### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `dataIndex` property does not support string values in the format `'[start, end]'`.
**Cause**: The current implementation of `fetchDataByPath` function does not handle string values in the format `'[start, end]'`. It expects a valid key or a dot-separated path to access the data in the object. When it encounters a string in the format `'[start, end]'`, it tries to split it using `split('.')`, which results in an incorrect key and ultimately leads to an `undefined` value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The application throws a `TypeError` when trying to access properties of `undefined`.
**Cause**: The `fetchDataByPath` function returns `undefined` when it cannot find the correct value for the given `dataIndex`. When the application tries to access properties like `startDate` and `endDate` on this `undefined` value, it results in a `TypeError`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `dataIndex` property is not compatible with the formily jsonschema requirements.
**Cause**: The formily jsonschema expects the `dataIndex` to be in a specific format that can be used to parse values from the data source. The current implementation of `fetchDataByPath` does not support this format, leading to compatibility issues.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `dataIndex` property does not support the required string format `'[start, end]'`, which is necessary for the formily jsonschema. This leads to incorrect data retrieval and subsequent errors when trying to access properties on `undefined` values. To fix this, the `fetchDataByPath` function needs to be updated to handle the `'[start, end]'` format and return `undefined` when the value is not found, ensuring compatibility with the formily jsonschema requirements.
