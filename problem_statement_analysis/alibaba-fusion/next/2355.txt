Let me analyze the problem and its causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TypeError occurs when trying to read property 'startDate,endDate' of undefined
**Cause**: The fetchDataByPath function is not properly handling the special string format '[startDate,endDate]' in the dataIndex. The current regex pattern and array access logic in the function only works for simple path strings but fails when encountering this array-like string format.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Table component cannot properly display data when dataIndex contains special format '[start,end]'
**Cause**: The Table component's data mapping mechanism (using formily and jsonschema) expects a standard dot notation path or simple string for dataIndex, but doesn't have built-in support for the array-like string format that the business logic requires.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The data fetching logic breaks when handling cascading selection scenarios
**Cause**: According to the Chinese comment in the last image, this special format is needed for cascading selection in editable table cells. The current implementation doesn't account for this use case where one column needs to map to multiple data fields.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the Table component's dataIndex handling being too restrictive. The problems manifest in three ways:
1. The fetchDataByPath function throws errors when processing special format strings
2. The Table component's data mapping system lacks compatibility with array-like dataIndex formats
3. The current implementation doesn't support business requirements for cascading selection in editable tables

To fix these issues, the fetchDataByPath function needs to be enhanced to handle the '[start,end]' format, and the Table component's data mapping mechanism needs to be made more flexible to accommodate these special dataIndex formats while maintaining compatibility with formily and jsonschema standards.
