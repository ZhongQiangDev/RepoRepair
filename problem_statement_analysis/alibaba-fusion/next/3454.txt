Based on the provided GitHub issue and image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker component doesn't immediately update/validate when the maximum value is changed.
**Cause**: The component likely lacks a real-time validation mechanism or proper event listener to detect changes in the max value property. When the max value is modified, the current value isn't being checked against the new maximum boundary.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The input value remains unchanged even when it exceeds the new maximum value
**Cause**: The validation of the input value against min/max constraints appears to only happen during initial setup or when the input value itself changes, but not when the min/max constraints are modified. There's missing logic to trigger revalidation when boundary conditions (min/max) are updated.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No visual feedback when the current value becomes invalid due to max value changes
**Cause**: The component doesn't implement proper UI feedback mechanisms to indicate when the current value becomes invalid due to boundary changes. This suggests missing error state handling and visual indicator implementation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the NumberPicker component's inability to handle dynamic changes to its maximum value constraint. The component needs three main improvements:
1. Implementation of real-time validation when max/min values change
2. Automatic adjustment of the current value when it exceeds new boundaries
3. Addition of proper visual feedback when values become invalid due to boundary changes

These issues likely stem from an incomplete implementation of the component's change detection and validation logic, particularly for handling dynamic boundary condition updates.
