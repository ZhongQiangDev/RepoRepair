### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker component does not update its maximum value in real-time when the `max` value is increased.
**Cause**: The component's state or props might not be re-rendering or updating correctly when the `max` value changes. This could be due to a missing `watch` or `computed` property that should react to changes in the `max` value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker component allows values that exceed the new maximum value after the `max` value is increased.
**Cause**: The component might not be validating the current value against the new `max` value after the `max` value changes. This could be due to a lack of proper validation logic that ensures the current value is within the new range.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The NumberPicker component is not updating its maximum value in real-time, and it allows values that exceed the new maximum value. This is likely due to missing reactive updates and validation logic. To fix this, the component should include a `watch` or `computed` property to react to changes in the `max` value and ensure the current value is always within the valid range.
