### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The overlay content collapses when the content is inline, and there is no space for the browser to render it properly.
**Cause**: The inline content does not have a defined width, causing the browser to collapse the content due to lack of space. This can be resolved by setting the width of the overlay content to 100%.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The overlay content does not display correctly, leading to a poor user experience.
**Cause**: The CSS properties for the overlay content may not be properly defined. Specifically, the `.next-overlay-wrapper` class has `position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;`, which might not provide enough space for the inline content to be displayed correctly. Adjusting these properties or adding additional styles might help in rendering the content properly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the collapse of inline content in the overlay due to insufficient width and potentially inadequate CSS properties. Setting the width of the overlay content to 100% and reviewing the CSS properties of the `.next-overlay-wrapper` class can help resolve these issues. Ensuring that the overlay content has enough space to be displayed correctly will improve the user experience.
