### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `popupContainer` configuration in `ConfigProvider` does not affect the `Dialog` component, causing the date picker to overflow outside the dialog.
**Cause**: The `popupContainer` prop in `ConfigProvider` is not being correctly passed down to the `Dialog` component. This could be due to the `Dialog` component not being designed to inherit this prop from `ConfigProvider`, or there might be a missing prop forwarding mechanism in the component hierarchy.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The date picker is not properly contained within the `Dialog` boundaries, leading to a poor user experience.
**Cause**: The `Dialog` component might not be using the `popupContainer` prop to render the date picker within its own container. Instead, it might be rendering the date picker in the default container, which is the body of the document, causing it to overflow outside the `Dialog`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `popupContainer` configuration in `ConfigProvider` is not being applied to the `Dialog` component, leading to the date picker overflowing outside the dialog. This is likely due to the `Dialog` component not being designed to inherit the `popupContainer` prop or not properly using it to render the date picker within its own container. To fix this, the `Dialog` component should be updated to correctly handle and apply the `popupContainer` prop from `ConfigProvider`.
