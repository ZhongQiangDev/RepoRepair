### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The time panel displays "Invalid Date" when `timePanelProps.defaultValue` is set.
**Cause**: The `defaultValue` provided for `timePanelProps` might not be in the correct format or might be an invalid date object. The component expects a valid JavaScript `Date` object, but if the provided value is not a valid date, it results in "Invalid Date".

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The time panel does not display the expected default time.
**Cause**: The `timePanelProps.defaultValue` might not be correctly passed down to the time panel component. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the component's props or a bug in the component's implementation that fails to handle the `defaultValue` prop correctly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The date picker does not function as expected when interacting with the time panel.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the state management of the date picker. If the state is not updated correctly when the time panel is interacted with, it can lead to unexpected behavior such as displaying "Invalid Date".

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is related to the incorrect or invalid `defaultValue` being passed to `timePanelProps`, leading to the display of "Invalid Date". This could be due to the value not being a valid `Date` object, a misconfiguration in the component's props, or a bug in the component's state management. Ensuring that a valid `Date` object is passed and that the component correctly handles this value should resolve the issue. Additionally, verifying the component's implementation for any bugs related to state management and prop handling is recommended.
