Let me analyze the DatePicker2 issue based on the provided information and image.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The time panel shows "Invalid Date" instead of the expected time value when timePanelProps.defaultValue is set
**Cause**: The defaultValue property in timePanelProps is likely being passed in an incorrect format or is not being properly parsed by the component's internal date handling logic

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The date picker calendar is displaying correctly but the time panel is not synchronized with it
**Cause**: There appears to be a disconnect between the date picker's date handling and the time panel's value handling, possibly due to:
1. Different date/time format expectations between components
2. Missing conversion between date formats when passing values between the calendar and time panel

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The time panel shows numeric values (0-6) in columns instead of proper time format
**Cause**: The time panel's formatting logic is not properly initializing or rendering the time values, possibly because:
1. Missing time format configuration
2. Incorrect data structure being passed to the time panel component
3. Time parsing logic failing to convert numeric values to proper time format

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper handling of the timePanelProps.defaultValue in the DatePicker2 component. This manifests in three ways:
1. Invalid Date display in the time panel
2. Lack of synchronization between date picker and time panel
3. Incorrect time format display

To fix these issues, the component needs:
- Proper date/time format validation
- Consistent date/time handling between the calendar and time panel
- Correct initialization of the time panel with proper format configurations
- Better error handling for invalid date/time values

The code would need to be reviewed to ensure proper date object creation and handling throughout the component's lifecycle.
