### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `selected` parameter in the `extra` object does not toggle between `true` and `false` as expected. After the first click, it remains `false` regardless of subsequent clicks.
**Cause**: The issue lies in the logic of the `onCategoryTreeNodeSelect` function. Specifically, the condition `extra.selected ? selectedKeys[0] : undefined` only sets the `selectedCategoryId` to `selectedKeys[0]` if `extra.selected` is `true`. However, `extra.selected` is not being toggled correctly, which means the condition is not being met after the first click. Additionally, the `selected` value in `extra` is not being updated in the state or passed correctly, leading to the value remaining `false`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The CSS styles for the selected node do not change as expected, making it impossible to visually distinguish between selected and unselected states.
**Cause**: The CSS styles are likely tied to the `selected` state of the node. Since the `selected` state is not being toggled correctly, the styles are not being updated. This could be due to the fact that the `selected` state is not being properly managed in the component's state or the styles are not being applied conditionally based on the `selected` state.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `selected` state of the tree node is not being toggled correctly, which affects both the functionality and the visual representation of the selected state. The `onCategoryTreeNodeSelect` function needs to be updated to properly toggle the `selected` state and ensure that the `selected` value is correctly passed and managed in the component's state. Additionally, the CSS styles should be applied conditionally based on the `selected` state to visually indicate the selection status.
