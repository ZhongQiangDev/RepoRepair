### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `itemRender` function in the `Upload` component does not support the delete functionality.
**Cause**: The `itemRender` function might not be properly configured to include a delete button or the delete functionality might not be implemented in the version 1.22.0 of the component.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The uploaded item cannot be deleted as indicated by the red arrow and text "不能删除" (cannot delete).
**Cause**: The `itemRender` function might be overriding the default behavior of the `Upload` component, which includes the delete functionality. This override might not include the necessary logic to handle the delete action.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The delete icon (X) is present but does not function as expected.
**Cause**: There might be a bug in the `itemRender` function where the delete icon is rendered but the associated event handler for the delete action is missing or not properly linked.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `itemRender` function in the `Upload` component does not support the delete functionality. This could be due to the function not being properly configured to include a delete button, overriding the default behavior of the component, or a bug where the delete icon is rendered but the event handler is missing. To fix this, the `itemRender` function should be reviewed and updated to include the necessary logic for the delete functionality.
