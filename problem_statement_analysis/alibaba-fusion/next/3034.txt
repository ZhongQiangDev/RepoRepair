Let me analyze the issue with the Upload component's itemRender functionality.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Upload component's itemRender does not provide delete functionality when customizing the upload list item display.
**Cause**: The itemRender prop appears to be overriding the default upload list item UI without properly implementing or exposing the delete operation that normally comes with the default upload list item renderer.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The UI shows "不能删除" (Cannot Delete) indication, suggesting the delete functionality is completely disabled or unavailable.
**Cause**: The custom itemRender implementation likely doesn't receive or properly handle the necessary props/methods (like onRemove) that are required for file deletion functionality.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The custom upload list item only shows the preview/thumbnail without expected file management controls.
**Cause**: The itemRender function implementation appears to be incomplete, focusing only on the display aspect while missing the standard file operation controls that should be available in an upload component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from an incomplete implementation of the itemRender functionality in the Upload component (version 1.22.0). While it allows customizing the appearance of upload list items, it fails to properly implement or expose the delete functionality that should be available by default. This appears to be a combination of:
1. Missing or improperly passed file deletion handlers
2. Incomplete itemRender implementation that doesn't include all necessary file management operations
3. Possible regression in version 1.22.0 regarding how itemRender interfaces with the component's core functionality

To fix this, the itemRender implementation needs to be reviewed to ensure it properly receives and implements all necessary file management operations, particularly the delete functionality.
