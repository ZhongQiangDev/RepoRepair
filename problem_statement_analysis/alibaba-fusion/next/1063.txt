Let me analyze the problem based on the code snippet and description provided.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Field component is modifying the input data (options.values) directly, which violates the principle of immutability.
**Cause**: The direct assignment `this.values = options.values || {};` creates a reference to the original options.values object rather than creating a deep copy. Any modifications to this.values will affect the original options.values object.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential memory leaks and unexpected side effects in other components using the same values object
**Cause**: Since the values object is passed by reference, multiple components or instances sharing the same values object could interfere with each other's state, leading to hard-to-debug issues.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Violation of React/Component best practices regarding props immutability
**Cause**: React components should treat their props as immutable and should not modify them directly. The current implementation doesn't follow this principle by maintaining a direct reference to the input props.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around the improper handling of the options.values object in the Field component. Instead of creating a deep copy of the values, it maintains a direct reference which can lead to:
1. Unintended modifications of the original data
2. Potential memory leaks and state management issues
3. Violation of React's immutability principles

To fix these issues, the component should create a deep copy of the options.values object, for example:
```javascript
this.values = options.values ? {...options.values} : {};  // For shallow copy
// or
this.values = options.values ? JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(options.values)) : {};  // For deep copy
```
This would ensure that the original data remains unchanged while the component maintains its own internal state.
