### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `Field` component is directly modifying the `options.values` object passed to it.
**Cause**: On line 35, `this.values` is assigned the value of `options.values` directly. If `options.values` is an object, any changes made to `this.values` will also affect the original `options.values` object because objects in JavaScript are passed by reference. This violates the requirement that the component should not modify the input data.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The component may not handle cases where `options.values` is `null` or `undefined` correctly.
**Cause**: The code uses `options.values || {}` to provide a default value. However, if `options.values` is `null`, it will still be treated as a falsy value, and an empty object `{}` will be assigned to `this.values`. This might not be the intended behavior if `null` is a valid input that should be preserved.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `Field` component directly assigns `options.values` to `this.values`, which can lead to unintended modifications of the input data due to JavaScript's reference behavior for objects. Additionally, the handling of `null` values for `options.values` may not align with the expected behavior. To address these issues, the component should create a deep copy of `options.values` before assignment and explicitly handle `null` values if they are valid inputs.
