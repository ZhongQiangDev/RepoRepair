### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The header filter options are not displayed correctly when `fixedHeader` and `resizable` are used together.
**Cause**: The issue likely arises from a conflict between the `fixedHeader` and `resizable` functionalities. When the table header is fixed, it may not properly account for the dynamic resizing of columns, leading to misalignment or incorrect display of the filter options.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The header filter options may overlap or be cut off.
**Cause**: The CSS styles applied to the fixed header might not be updated correctly when the columns are resized. This can result in the filter options being positioned incorrectly relative to the header cells.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The filter options may not be responsive to the resized column widths.
**Cause**: The JavaScript logic that handles the resizing of columns might not be recalculating the positions and sizes of the filter options in the header. This can cause the filter options to appear in the wrong place or with incorrect dimensions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the conflict between the `fixedHeader` and `resizable` functionalities in the table component. The fixed header does not properly handle the dynamic resizing of columns, leading to misalignment and incorrect display of the filter options. To resolve this, the CSS styles and JavaScript logic for handling column resizing need to be updated to ensure that the filter options are correctly positioned and sized relative to the header cells.
