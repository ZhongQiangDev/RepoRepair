Based on the GitHub issue and the code snippet provided, I'll analyze the problem:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Field component is modifying the input data (options.values) directly
**Cause**: In the code line `this.values = options.values || {};`, there's a direct assignment of the reference to options.values. In JavaScript, objects are passed by reference, so any modifications to this.values will also affect the original options.values object.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No data immutability protection
**Cause**: The code doesn't create a deep copy of the input values, which violates the principle of immutability. This can lead to unexpected side effects where the original data gets modified when the Field component updates its internal state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential mutation of default empty object
**Cause**: When options.values is undefined, the code uses `|| {}` to provide a default empty object. However, since this same object reference is stored in this.values, any modifications to this.values will create a shared mutable state across multiple instances if options.values is not provided.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper handling of data immutability in the Field component. The component directly references and potentially modifies the input data instead of working with a copy. This violates React/Component best practices where props should be treated as immutable. To fix this, the code should:

1. Create a deep copy of options.values before assignment
2. Use immutable update patterns when modifying the values
3. Consider using immutable data structures or Object.freeze() for additional safety

A possible fix would be to modify the code to:
```javascript
this.values = options.values ? {...JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(options.values))} : {};
```
or use immutable libraries like Immutable.js.
