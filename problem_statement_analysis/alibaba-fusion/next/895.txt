Based on the provided GitHub problem description and image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Empty white spaces appear in the Nav component when using iconOnly mode for items that don't have icons configured
**Cause**: The Nav component is likely still reserving space for icons even when no icon is specified for an item in iconOnly mode. This appears to be a layout/rendering issue where the component isn't properly handling the absence of icons.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent visual appearance in the navigation menu
**Cause**: The component doesn't have proper fallback handling for items without icons when in iconOnly mode. Instead of hiding or adjusting these items, it's showing them as empty spaces which breaks the visual consistency of the navigation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor space utilization in iconOnly mode
**Cause**: The current implementation appears to maintain the same spacing/padding regardless of whether an icon exists or not, leading to unnecessary white space that could be collapsed or handled differently.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around the Nav component's handling of items without icons in iconOnly mode. Instead of properly handling these cases, it's creating empty spaces that affect both functionality and visual appearance. The component needs to be modified to either:
1. Hide items without icons when in iconOnly mode
2. Provide a default icon fallback
3. Adjust the layout to eliminate empty spaces
4. Or throw a warning/error when iconOnly mode is used with items lacking icons

This would improve both the user experience and visual consistency of the navigation component.
