### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In the `iconOnly` mode, items without configured icons are displaying blank spaces instead of being hidden or replaced with a default icon.
**Cause**: The component logic for `iconOnly` mode is not properly handling cases where an icon is not configured. It is likely that the component is expecting an icon for every item and is rendering a placeholder or empty space when an icon is missing.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The blank spaces are disrupting the visual flow and usability of the navigation menu, making it unclear which items are available for selection.
**Cause**: The absence of a fallback mechanism for items without icons leads to inconsistent UI behavior. The component may not have a default icon or a conditional rendering logic to handle missing icons gracefully, resulting in blank spaces that affect the user experience.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `iconOnly` mode in the navigation component does not handle missing icons correctly, leading to blank spaces that disrupt the visual and functional integrity of the menu. The cause is a lack of proper handling for items without configured icons, either through a default icon or conditional rendering logic. To resolve this, the component should be updated to include a fallback icon or to hide items without icons, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly navigation experience.
