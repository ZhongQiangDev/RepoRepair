Let me analyze the TreeSelect component issue based on the provided information:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate labels appearing in the input box when a disabled item is selected by default
**Cause**: The TreeSelect component is rendering the same label multiple times because it's encountering duplicate keys for the disabled selected items. This is evident from the warning message about encountering "two children with the same key".

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: React key warning in the console
**Cause**: The component is not generating unique keys for each child element in the tree structure. The code shows that the same value "4" is being used multiple times, which violates React's requirement for unique keys among siblings.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent handling of disabled items in the selection state
**Cause**: The TreeSelect component's logic for handling disabled items in combination with default values appears to be flawed. When an item is both disabled and selected by default, the component's internal state management isn't properly handling this combination, leading to duplicate representations in the UI.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper key management and state handling in the TreeSelect component when dealing with disabled items that are selected by default. This manifests in three ways:
1. Visual duplication of labels in the input box
2. React key warnings in the console
3. Inconsistent state management for disabled+selected items

To fix these issues, the component needs to:
- Implement a proper key generation mechanism for tree nodes
- Revise the logic for handling disabled items in combination with default selections
- Ensure proper deduplication of selected values in the internal state management
