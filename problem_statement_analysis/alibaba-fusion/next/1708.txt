### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The input box displays duplicate labels ("Input" appears twice).
**Cause**: The issue arises because the `TreeSelect` component is rendering duplicate items due to the presence of a disabled item in the default selected values. When the component initializes, it processes both the default selected values and the disabled items, leading to the duplication of labels in the input box.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message "Encountered two children with the same key" is displayed in the console.
**Cause**: This warning is triggered because the `TreeSelect` component is generating duplicate keys for the items in the tree structure. When the component tries to render the disabled item along with the default selected values, it assigns the same key to multiple items, violating the React key uniqueness requirement. This results in the warning message being logged in the console.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The problem described involves two main issues: duplicate labels in the input box and a warning about duplicate keys in the console. Both issues stem from the `TreeSelect` component's handling of disabled items and default selected values during initialization. The component is not properly managing the rendering of these items, leading to duplication and key conflicts. To resolve these issues, the component logic needs to be adjusted to ensure that disabled items and default selected values are processed correctly without causing duplication or key conflicts.
