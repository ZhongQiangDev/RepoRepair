### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker displays `4.029999999999999` instead of `4.03` when the `+` button is clicked.
**Cause**: This is due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript. When adding `4.02` and `0.01`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary. This leads to a small rounding error, resulting in `4.029999999999999`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker does not round the result to the specified precision (2 decimal places) as expected.
**Cause**: The NumberPicker component may not be correctly implementing rounding logic. Even though the `precision` prop is set to `2`, the component does not round the result to two decimal places, leading to the display of the imprecise floating-point result.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inherent imprecision of JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic, which causes the result of `4.02 + 0.01` to be `4.029999999999999` instead of `4.03`. Additionally, the NumberPicker component does not properly round the result to the specified precision, exacerbating the display issue. To fix this, the component should implement proper rounding logic to ensure the result is displayed with the correct number of decimal places.
