### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Tab component does not support scrolling when the content exceeds the available space.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the Tab component does not include a scrollable container or a mechanism to enable horizontal scrolling when the content overflows. This could be due to missing CSS properties like `overflow-x: auto` or `scrollable` behavior not being implemented in the component's logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Tab component does not allow users to navigate through tabs using keyboard inputs.
**Cause**: The component may lack keyboard event listeners or accessibility features that enable navigation via keyboard shortcuts. This could be due to the absence of `tabindex` attributes or event handlers for key presses like `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Tab component does not support drag-and-drop functionality for navigating through tabs.
**Cause**: The component may not have implemented drag-and-drop functionality, which requires specific event listeners and logic to handle drag events. This could be due to the absence of `draggable` attributes and corresponding event handlers for `dragstart`, `dragend`, and `dragover`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Tab component has multiple issues related to navigation and accessibility when the content exceeds the available space. The primary causes include the lack of a scrollable container, missing keyboard event listeners, and the absence of drag-and-drop functionality. Addressing these issues would involve updating the component's CSS and JavaScript logic to include scrollable behavior, keyboard navigation, and drag-and-drop support.
