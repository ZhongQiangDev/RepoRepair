### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `defaultValue` "jack" is not displayed in the Select component when using `fillProps="name"` with an empty `dataSource`.
**Cause**: The `fillProps` attribute is likely designed to map a specific property from the `dataSource` to the display value. When `dataSource` is empty, there is no data to map the `fillProps` value to, resulting in the `defaultValue` not being displayed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Select component does not show the `defaultValue` when `dataSource` is empty.
**Cause**: The Select component may be programmed to only display values that are present in the `dataSource`. When `dataSource` is empty, the component may not have any data to display, thus ignoring the `defaultValue`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Select component does not display the `defaultValue` when `dataSource` is empty and `fillProps` is used. This is likely due to the component's design to map `fillProps` values from `dataSource`, and its behavior to only display values present in `dataSource`. To fix this, the component should be updated to display the `defaultValue` even when `dataSource` is empty.
