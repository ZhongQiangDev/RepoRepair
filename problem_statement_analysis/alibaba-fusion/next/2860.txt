Based on the GitHub problem description and image provided, I'll analyze the issues with the NumberPicker component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Operation buttons (+ and -) remain hidden when keyboard focus moves to them using Tab key
**Cause**: The component is likely using only :hover pseudo-class to show the operation buttons, without considering keyboard focus states. It needs to handle :focus and :focus-within states as well.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: NumberPicker loses its focus style when operation buttons are focused
**Cause**: The component is using simple :focus selector instead of :focus-within CSS pseudo-class. :focus-within would maintain the focus style on the parent NumberPicker container even when focus moves to its child elements (operation buttons).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor keyboard accessibility implementation
**Cause**: The component's keyboard interaction pattern isn't properly implemented according to accessibility standards. When using keyboard navigation, visual indicators should clearly show which elements are interactive and currently focused.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The NumberPicker component has three main issues related to keyboard interaction and focus management:
1. Operation buttons visibility isn't properly handled for keyboard focus states
2. Focus styles don't persist when focus moves within the component
3. Overall keyboard accessibility needs improvement

To fix these issues, the component should:
- Implement :focus-within to maintain focus styles on the container
- Show operation buttons when any element within the NumberPicker receives focus
- Ensure proper visual feedback for all interactive elements during keyboard navigation
