### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When the keyboard focus moves to the NumberPicker's internal input field, the operation buttons (plus and minus) should be visible, but they remain hidden.
**Cause**: The CSS or JavaScript logic that controls the visibility of the operation buttons is not correctly detecting the focus state of the input field. This could be due to a missing or incorrect focus event listener or a CSS rule that does not properly handle the `:focus` or `:focus-within` pseudo-classes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: After pressing the tab key to focus on the operation buttons, the NumberPicker loses its focus state, and the operation buttons remain hidden.
**Cause**: The NumberPicker component is not properly maintaining its focus state when the focus moves to its child elements (the operation buttons). This could be due to a lack of proper implementation of the `:focus-within` pseudo-class in the CSS, which should keep the parent element in a focused state when any of its child elements are focused.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the visibility of the operation buttons and the maintenance of the focus state within the NumberPicker component. The causes are likely due to missing or incorrect focus event handling and CSS rules. Specifically, the `:focus-within` pseudo-class should be used to ensure that the NumberPicker retains its focus state when its child elements are focused, and the visibility of the operation buttons should be controlled based on the focus state of the input field.
