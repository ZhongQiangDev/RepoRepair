Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and screenshot.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TypeError occurs when trying to read properties of null (reading 'getInstance')
**Cause**: The error suggests that when v2 mode is enabled in popupProps, the code is trying to access a 'getInstance' method on an object that is null. This likely happens because the v2 popup implementation expects certain initialization or instance creation that isn't properly happening.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Undefined stack trace information is shown
**Cause**: The undefined error message indicates that proper error handling or error information propagation is not implemented for the v2 popup mode, making it difficult to debug the actual source of the problem.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Incompatibility between showSearch and v2 popup mode
**Cause**: Based on the code snippet, there appears to be a conflict between the showSearch functionality and the v2 popup implementation. The combination of these two features may not have been properly tested or implemented to work together.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from enabling v2 mode in the CascaderSelect component's popupProps while using showSearch functionality. This causes three main problems:
1. A null reference error when trying to access 'getInstance'
2. Poor error handling leading to undefined error messages
3. Potential incompatibility between v2 popup mode and search functionality

To fix these issues, the component's v2 popup implementation needs to be reviewed, proper instance initialization needs to be ensured, and the interaction between v2 mode and search functionality needs to be properly implemented. It would also be beneficial to improve error handling to provide more meaningful error messages.
