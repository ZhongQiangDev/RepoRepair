### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The application throws an error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getInstance')".
**Cause**: The error suggests that the `popupProps` configuration with `v2: true` is not being handled correctly by the `CascaderSelect` component. It seems that the component is trying to access a property or method on a null object, likely due to the `v2` configuration not being properly initialized or supported in the current version of the component.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `popupProps` with `v2: true` is causing the application to crash.
**Cause**: The `v2` property might be an experimental or unsupported feature in the current version of the `CascaderSelect` component. The component may not have the necessary logic to handle this property, leading to a null reference error when it tries to access something that hasn't been properly set up.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `popupProps` with `v2: true` is not being handled correctly by the `CascaderSelect` component, leading to a null reference error. This could be due to the `v2` feature being experimental, unsupported, or improperly initialized in the current version of the component. To resolve this, you should check the documentation or the component's source code to ensure that `v2` is a supported feature and that it is being used correctly. If `v2` is not supported, you may need to remove it or use an alternative configuration.
