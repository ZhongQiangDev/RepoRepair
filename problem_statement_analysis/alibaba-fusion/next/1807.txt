Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub issue description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate text content when title matches innerText
**Cause**: The current implementation automatically adds the Menu Item's text content as a title attribute, which violates WCAG guidelines about avoiding redundant text when the title and innerText are identical.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unwanted tooltip popups
**Cause**: The automatic title attribute causes tooltip popups to appear after hovering for 3 seconds, which some business users find disruptive and unnecessary for their use cases.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior with custom Menu Items
**Cause**: When Menu Items contain complex content (not just pure text, e.g. with icons), the current title implementation doesn't handle these cases well, leading to either missing tooltips for truncated content or potential double tooltip issues.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inflexible tooltip behavior
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't provide a way to control when titles/tooltips should appear, forcing all Menu Items to have the same behavior regardless of the specific use case or user needs.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Screen reader accessibility issues
**Cause**: The current implementation may cause screen readers to read the same content twice (once for the visible text and once for the title), while proposed solutions like using aria-label might prevent screen readers from reading the actual DOM content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues revolve around balancing multiple competing needs:
1. Accessibility requirements (screen reader support)
2. UX considerations (showing truncated text)
3. WCAG compliance (avoiding redundant text)
4. Business requirements (controlling tooltip behavior)

The current implementation tries to solve accessibility and truncation issues by automatically adding titles, but this creates problems with WCAG compliance, user experience, and flexibility. Any solution needs to carefully balance these different requirements while providing enough control to handle various use cases appropriately.
