### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When the `title` attribute is added to the Menu Item, it causes redundant text for screen readers and may violate WCAG guidelines when the `title` and `innerText` are the same.
**Cause**: The automatic addition of the `title` attribute to Menu Items without considering the content of `innerText` leads to redundancy. This is particularly problematic when the `innerText` is already descriptive enough, making the `title` unnecessary and potentially confusing for users relying on screen readers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The appearance of the `title` tooltip affects some business users who do not want it to appear on the page.
**Cause**: The automatic addition of the `title` attribute does not provide an option for users to disable it, leading to an unwanted user experience for those who prefer a cleaner interface without tooltips.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: In some cases, the `title` tooltip does not appear for custom Menu Items, leading to issues with long folded text.
**Cause**: The current implementation of automatically setting the `title` attribute is too strict, only applying to Menu Items with pure string children. This excludes custom Menu Items, which may still need the `title` tooltip for long folded text.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The automatic addition of the `title` attribute to Menu Items causes redundancy and violates WCAG guidelines when the `innerText` is the same. It also affects business users who do not want tooltips and fails to handle custom Menu Items properly. To address these issues, a more flexible approach is needed, such as providing a configuration option to control the `title` attribute or using `aria-label` for accessibility while ensuring long folded text remains visible.
