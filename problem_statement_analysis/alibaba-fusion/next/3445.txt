### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onChange` event is triggered twice when the `id` attribute is added to the `Rating` component.
**Cause**: The `id` attribute might be causing a re-render of the component, leading to the `onChange` event being triggered twice. This could be due to the way the `Rating` component is implemented, where it might be listening to changes on the `id` attribute and causing a re-render.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onChange` event is triggered twice when the `id` attribute is added to the `Rating` component.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the event handling in the `Rating` component. The `onChange` event might be attached to multiple elements or events, causing it to be triggered twice. This could be due to the way the `Rating` component is implemented, where it might be attaching the `onChange` event to multiple elements or events.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onChange` event is triggered twice when the `id` attribute is added to the `Rating` component.
**Cause**: There might be an issue with the state management in the `Rating` component. The `onChange` event might be causing a state update, which in turn causes a re-render of the component, leading to the `onChange` event being triggered twice. This could be due to the way the `Rating` component is implemented, where it might be managing state in a way that causes a re-render on state update.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The `onChange` event is triggered twice when the `id` attribute is added to the `Rating` component. This could be due to the way the `Rating` component is implemented, where it might be listening to changes on the `id` attribute, attaching the `onChange` event to multiple elements or events, or managing state in a way that causes a re-render on state update. To fix this issue, the `Rating` component implementation needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure that the `onChange` event is only triggered once.
