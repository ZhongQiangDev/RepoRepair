Based on the GitHub problem description and the code snippet provided, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Rating component's onChange event is being triggered twice when a rating value is changed.
**Cause**: This is likely due to React's Strict Mode combined with the id prop. When an id is provided to the Rating component, it may be causing the component to re-render unnecessarily or trigger multiple change events due to how the internal state and DOM events are being handled.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent event handling behavior between Rating components with and without id props.
**Cause**: The Rating component might be using both controlled and uncontrolled patterns simultaneously when an id is provided. This could lead to the component trying to sync its internal state while also responding to DOM events, resulting in duplicate onChange calls.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Unnecessary console logging duplicates
**Cause**: The event propagation might not be properly handled within the Rating component when an id is present, causing the event to bubble up and trigger the handler multiple times.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be a double-firing of the onChange event in the Rating component when an id prop is provided. This is likely caused by:
1. Potential conflicts between controlled and uncontrolled component patterns
2. Improper event handling or propagation
3. Unnecessary re-renders triggered by the id prop

To fix this, the component's internal implementation should be reviewed to:
- Ensure proper event handling and prevention of duplicate events
- Review the component's lifecycle and state management when id props are present
- Potentially implement event debouncing or proper event cleanup
- Verify that the component follows either a controlled or uncontrolled pattern consistently
