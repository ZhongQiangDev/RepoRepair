### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The error "Cannot add property pos, object is not extensible" occurs when trying to set the `pos` property on an item.
**Cause**: The `item` object is marked as non-extensible, meaning no new properties can be added to it. This is likely due to the object being frozen or sealed at some point in the code, preventing modifications.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error "Cannot read property 'pos' of undefined" occurs when trying to access the `pos` property.
**Cause**: The `item` object is `undefined` when the code attempts to access its `pos` property. This indicates that the `item` variable is not being properly initialized or passed in the function call, leading to a reference to `undefined`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `item.pos` property is not being set correctly.
**Cause**: The `item.pos` assignment is happening after logging `item.pos`, which might cause confusion in debugging. Additionally, if `item` is non-extensible, the assignment will fail silently, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the `item` object being non-extensible and potentially `undefined`. The non-extensible nature of the object prevents new properties from being added, while the `undefined` value causes property access errors. To resolve these issues, ensure that the `item` object is properly initialized and is not marked as non-extensible before attempting to modify it. Additionally, add checks to ensure `item` is not `undefined` before accessing its properties.
