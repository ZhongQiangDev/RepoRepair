### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `margin-bottom` property is set to different values (16px and 8px) in different demo files, causing inconsistent spacing between elements.
**Cause**: The styles are hardcoded with specific values in the CSS, leading to conflicts and inconsistencies across different demos.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `margin-bottom` property is applied globally to the `.next-select` class, affecting all instances of the Select component.
**Cause**: The CSS selector is too broad, applying the same margin to all Select components regardless of their specific context or requirements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Select component's layout is disrupted when the `margin-bottom` is set to 8px, causing elements to overlap or appear too close together.
**Cause**: The hardcoded `margin-bottom` value of 8px is too small for the layout requirements of some demos, leading to visual issues.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from hardcoded and overly broad CSS styles that cause inconsistent spacing and layout disruptions. To resolve these problems, the styles should be made more specific and flexible, ensuring that each demo can have its own appropriate spacing without affecting others. This can be achieved by using more specific CSS selectors or by applying inline styles where necessary. Additionally, reviewing and standardizing the margin values across all demos will help maintain consistency and improve the overall visual presentation.
