Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Overlay (DatePicker popup) appears in the wrong position when there are two scrollbars and after scrolling
**Cause**: The positioning calculation for the overlay component likely doesn't account for both the window scroll position and the container's scroll position. When there are multiple scrollable containers, the offset calculations need to consider all parent scrollable elements' positions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: NumberPicker's innerBefore style is incorrect and innerAfter is not supported
**Cause**: Looking at the UI screenshots, the number input fields show styling issues with the "before" and "after" elements. This appears to be a CSS implementation issue where:
1. The innerBefore styling rules are not properly applied to the number input component
2. The innerAfter functionality is either not implemented or has missing style definitions

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Number input fields show inconsistent styling across different sections
**Cause**: From the screenshots, there are multiple number input fields (端口数量) that should have consistent styling but appear to have different implementations or styling rules applied. This suggests:
1. Lack of standardized component styling
2. Different style overrides being applied in different contexts
3. Possible CSS specificity conflicts

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues primarily revolve around two main components:
1. The Overlay component has positioning calculation problems when dealing with multiple scrollable containers, leading to misplaced popups.
2. The NumberPicker component has styling inconsistencies and incomplete implementation of inner elements (before/after), affecting the visual presentation and functionality of number input fields across the interface.

These issues appear to be related to both JavaScript positioning logic and CSS styling implementation. Fixing them would require:
- Updating the overlay positioning algorithm to handle multiple scroll contexts
- Standardizing the NumberPicker component's styling implementation
- Properly implementing support for innerBefore and innerAfter elements
