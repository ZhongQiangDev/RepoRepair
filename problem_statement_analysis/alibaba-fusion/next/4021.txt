### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker allows the user to input a value that exceeds the maximum limit, even though the UI indicates a restriction on the order size.
**Cause**: The input validation is not properly implemented. The NumberPicker should prevent the user from entering values beyond the maximum limit in real-time, rather than only correcting the value on onBlur.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The price does not change even when the quantity is increased beyond the expected limit.
**Cause**: The logic that calculates the total price is not correctly linked to the quantity input. The system might be using a fixed value for the total price or not updating the price calculation when the quantity exceeds the expected limit.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the lack of real-time input validation in the NumberPicker and the incorrect price calculation logic. To fix these issues, the NumberPicker should be updated to prevent users from entering values beyond the maximum limit in real-time. Additionally, the price calculation logic should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the total price updates dynamically based on the valid quantity input. This will ensure a better user experience and accurate order processing.
