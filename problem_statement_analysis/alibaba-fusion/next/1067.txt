Based on the provided GitHub problem description and image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The left arrow (previous button) is disabled when slidesToShow > slidesCount, infinite={false}, and defaultActiveIndex !== 0
**Cause**: The slider component's logic is incorrectly handling the edge case where:
1. The number of slides to show (slidesToShow) is greater than the total number of slides (slidesCount)
2. Infinite scrolling is disabled (infinite={false})
3. The default active index is not 0 (defaultActiveIndex !== 0)
In this scenario, the component is wrongly assuming that there are no previous slides to show, even though the user should be able to navigate back to earlier slides given the defaultActiveIndex is not 0.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Navigation logic inconsistency when slidesToShow exceeds slidesCount
**Cause**: The slider's navigation state calculation doesn't properly account for cases where slidesToShow > slidesCount. The component should still allow navigation when defaultActiveIndex > 0, regardless of the relationship between slidesToShow and slidesCount.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from improper handling of navigation state in the Slider component when dealing with specific prop combinations. The component needs to be updated to:
1. Properly evaluate navigation possibilities based on the current index rather than just the slidesToShow and slidesCount relationship
2. Allow backward navigation when defaultActiveIndex > 0, regardless of other conditions
3. Maintain consistent navigation behavior across all valid prop combinations

The fix would likely involve modifying the logic that determines when the left arrow should be disabled, ensuring it considers the current slide position (defaultActiveIndex) as the primary factor rather than just the relationship between slidesToShow and slidesCount.
