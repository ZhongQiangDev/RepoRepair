### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The left arrow is disabled when `slidesToShow > slidesCount` and `infinite={false}` and `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`.
**Cause**: When `slidesToShow` is greater than `slidesCount`, the slider tries to display more slides than are available. This can cause the slider to not know how to handle the navigation, especially when `infinite` is set to `false`. Additionally, setting `defaultActiveIndex` to a value other than `0` can further confuse the slider's navigation logic, leading to the left arrow being disabled.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The slider does not allow navigation to the left when it should.
**Cause**: The combination of `slidesToShow > slidesCount` and `infinite={false}` means that the slider cannot loop back to the beginning, and with `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`, the slider starts in a position where it believes there are no more slides to the left, thus disabling the left arrow.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the configuration of the slider with `slidesToShow > slidesCount`, `infinite={false}`, and `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`. This combination confuses the slider's navigation logic, leading to the left arrow being disabled. To fix this, either ensure `slidesToShow` is less than or equal to `slidesCount`, or adjust the `defaultActiveIndex` to `0` if `infinite` is `false`. This will help the slider correctly handle the navigation and prevent the left arrow from being disabled unnecessarily.
