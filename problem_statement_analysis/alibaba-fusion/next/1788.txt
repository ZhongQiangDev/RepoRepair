### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onBlur` event handler in the TypeScript code is defined with a parameter of type `MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>`, but the expected type is `() => void`.
**Cause**: The `onBlur` prop in the component's type definition expects a function that takes no arguments (`() => void`), but the provided function expects a `MouseEvent` argument. This type mismatch causes the TypeScript error.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onBlur` event handler is not correctly handling the event as expected.
**Cause**: The `onBlur` event handler is defined to accept a `MouseEvent` parameter, but the component's type definition does not support this. This mismatch can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior when the event is triggered.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is a type mismatch between the `onBlur` event handler's definition and the component's type definition. The `onBlur` prop expects a function with no arguments, but the provided function expects a `MouseEvent` argument. To fix this, either change the `onBlur` prop's type definition to accept a `MouseEvent` parameter or modify the event handler to match the expected type. This will ensure that the event is handled correctly and that TypeScript type checking works as intended.
