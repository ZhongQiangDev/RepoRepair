Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue and error message.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: TypeError: Cannot read property 'className' of undefined error occurs in the Group component
**Cause**: The space in the Group label="Group Label 1" is causing the component to incorrectly parse the children elements. The space character in the label value is likely being interpreted as a delimiter, causing the component to try to create multiple children elements incorrectly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Component structure parsing error
**Cause**: The Menu/Group/SubMenu component hierarchy seems to have an issue with handling whitespace characters in attribute values. When the label contains spaces, the parser appears to be splitting the content incorrectly, leading to malformed component structure.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: React DOM rendering failure
**Cause**: The error stack trace shows the issue originates from the Group.render method and propagates through React's component lifecycle methods. This suggests that the Group component's internal rendering logic is not properly handling the space-containing label attribute, causing it to fail when trying to access className property of an undefined object.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of whitespace characters in the Group component's label attribute. When the label contains spaces (like "Group Label 1"), the component's parsing mechanism breaks down, leading to:
1. Incorrect children element creation
2. Component structure corruption
3. Runtime TypeError when attempting to render

To fix this, the component needs to be modified to:
- Properly handle whitespace in attribute values
- Ensure robust parsing of label attributes
- Maintain correct component hierarchy regardless of spaces in labels

The immediate workaround might be to either:
- Use alternative characters instead of spaces (e.g., hyphens or underscores)
- Enclose the label value in quotes if not already done
- Fix the Group component's internal parsing logic to properly handle spaces
