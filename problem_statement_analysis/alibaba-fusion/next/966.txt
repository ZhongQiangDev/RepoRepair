### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `Group` component is treating the space in the `label` prop ("Group Label 1") as multiple children, leading to an error.
**Cause**: The `Group` component's implementation is not correctly handling spaces in the `label` prop. It seems to be splitting the label string by spaces and treating each part as a separate child, which is not the intended behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message "Cannot read property 'className' of undefined" is thrown.
**Cause**: This error occurs because the `Group` component is trying to access a property (`className`) on an undefined object. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of the `label` prop, where the component expects a single child but receives multiple due to the space splitting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `Group` component is not correctly handling spaces in the `label` prop. This causes the label to be split into multiple parts, which the component then treats as separate children. This leads to the component trying to access properties on undefined objects, resulting in the "Cannot read property 'className' of undefined" error. To fix this, the `Group` component should be updated to handle labels with spaces correctly, ensuring that the label is treated as a single string rather than multiple children.
