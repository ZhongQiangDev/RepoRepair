Let me analyze the problem with the NumberPicker component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker displays 4.029999 instead of 4.03 when incrementing from 4.02 by 0.01
**Cause**: This is caused by JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic precision limitations. JavaScript uses 64-bit floating-point numbers (IEEE 754), which can't precisely represent some decimal fractions. When performing arithmetic with decimals like 4.02 + 0.01, it results in 4.029999999999999 instead of exactly 4.03.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The precision prop is not properly handling the floating-point rounding
**Cause**: Even though precision={2} is set in the NumberPicker props, the component is not properly rounding the calculated value before displaying it. The raw floating-point result is being shown instead of being rounded to the specified precision.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is browser-specific (Safari)
**Cause**: While floating-point precision issues exist in all JavaScript environments, the way Safari handles the display of these numbers might differ from other browsers, making the issue more visible in Safari. This suggests the component's number formatting logic isn't consistently implemented across different browsers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from JavaScript's inherent floating-point precision limitations, which causes simple decimal arithmetic to produce unexpected results (4.02 + 0.01 = 4.029999999999999). This is exacerbated by:
1. Lack of proper rounding in the NumberPicker component despite the precision prop
2. Inconsistent number formatting across browsers
3. No implementation of a decimal arithmetic solution to handle precise calculations

To fix this, the component should:
- Implement proper rounding to the specified precision
- Use a decimal arithmetic library or proper number formatting
- Ensure consistent behavior across all browsers
- Consider using techniques like multiplying by powers of 10 to avoid floating-point precision issues
