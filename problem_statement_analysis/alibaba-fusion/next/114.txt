### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker displays `4.029999999999999` instead of `4.03` when the `+` button is clicked.
**Cause**: This issue arises due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript. When adding `4.02` and `0.01`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary. This leads to a small rounding error, resulting in `4.029999999999999`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The NumberPicker does not round the result to the specified precision (`precision={2}`).
**Cause**: The NumberPicker component may not be correctly implementing rounding logic to handle the precision. Even though the `precision` prop is set to `2`, the component might be directly displaying the result of the floating-point addition without rounding it to two decimal places.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is specific to Safari.
**Cause**: While the floating-point arithmetic issue is a general JavaScript problem, the display of the result might be influenced by browser-specific behavior. Safari might handle floating-point numbers or their string representation slightly differently compared to other browsers, leading to the observed discrepancy.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inherent inaccuracy of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript, which causes the NumberPicker to display an incorrect value. This is compounded by the lack of proper rounding to the specified precision within the NumberPicker component. Additionally, browser-specific behavior, particularly in Safari, may contribute to the observed issue. To resolve this, the NumberPicker should implement proper rounding logic to handle the precision correctly and account for the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.
