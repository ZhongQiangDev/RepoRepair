Let me analyze the issue based on the provided screenshot and description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Cascader component shows title attribute tooltips when hovering over items, which may not be desired in some use cases.
**Cause**: By default, the Cascader component automatically adds HTML title attributes to its options for accessibility purposes. Currently there's no built-in API to disable this behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tooltip appears to be showing the same text as the option label, which creates redundant information.
**Cause**: The Cascader component automatically uses the option's label value as the title attribute content, without providing a way to customize or disable this behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the Cascader component automatically adds title tooltips to its options without providing an API to disable this feature. This creates potentially unwanted or redundant tooltips when hovering over items. The user is requesting an API to control this behavior, specifically to be able to remove these title tooltips when they're not needed. This would give developers more flexibility in controlling the UI experience of their Cascader components.

A potential solution would be to add a new prop (e.g. `showTitle` or `titleEnabled`) to allow developers to toggle this behavior on/off as needed.
