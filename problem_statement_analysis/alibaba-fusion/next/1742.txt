### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The title information is displayed in the dropdown menu, which the user wants to remove.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the Cascader component does not provide an API to hide or remove the title information. The title is likely hardcoded or set as a default property that cannot be easily overridden without additional configuration options.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The title information is not configurable, leading to a lack of flexibility in the user interface.
**Cause**: The Cascader component may not have been designed with customization options for the title. This could be due to the initial design constraints or the absence of user requirements for such customization at the time of development.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of an API to remove or hide the title information in the Cascader component. This is caused by the current implementation not providing the necessary customization options. To address this, the component should be updated to include an API that allows users to control the visibility of the title information, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the component.
