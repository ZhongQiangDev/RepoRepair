### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The background color of the dropdown menu in the CascaderSelect component appears abnormal when using virtual scrolling.
**Cause**: The issue might be due to the virtual scrolling mechanism not properly updating the background color of the dropdown items. This could be caused by a CSS styling issue where the background color is not being applied correctly to the dynamically rendered elements during scrolling.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown menu items may not be visually consistent with the rest of the UI.
**Cause**: The virtual scrolling implementation might be interfering with the CSS styles, leading to inconsistent rendering of the dropdown items. This could be due to the virtual scrolling library not properly handling the CSS properties for the dynamically loaded items.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the abnormal background color in the dropdown menu of the CascaderSelect component when using virtual scrolling. This is likely caused by a combination of CSS styling issues and the virtual scrolling mechanism not properly updating the background color of dynamically rendered elements. Addressing these causes will help ensure consistent and correct rendering of the dropdown items.
