Based on the provided image, I'll analyze the issues with the CascaderSelect component when using virtual scrolling.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent background color in the cascader dropdown menu
**Cause**: The virtual scrolling implementation is likely interfering with the default background color styling of the cascader options. When virtual scrolling is enabled, the component may not properly apply the background color to all virtually rendered items.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual overlap between the JSON data display and the cascader menu
**Cause**: The z-index or layering of the components seems to be incorrectly configured, causing the JSON data to show through or overlap with the cascader dropdown menu, which should be on top and visually separate.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Improper styling of selected/hover states
**Cause**: The virtual scrolling implementation may not be properly maintaining the hover and selected states of items as they are recycled in and out of view, leading to inconsistent visual feedback.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the interaction between virtual scrolling and the component's styling system. The problems include background color inconsistencies, improper layering of UI elements, and issues with state management for hover/selected items. These issues are likely caused by the virtual scrolling implementation not properly handling the CSS and state management of recycled DOM elements. To fix these issues, the virtual scrolling implementation needs to be updated to:
1. Properly maintain background colors for virtually scrolled items
2. Ensure correct z-index layering
3. Properly handle state management for hover and selected states
4. Ensure proper cleanup and reapplication of styles when recycling DOM elements
