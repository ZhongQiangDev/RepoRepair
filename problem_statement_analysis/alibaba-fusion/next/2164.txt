Let me analyze the problem based on the provided description and image.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sort icon in the table header lacks a cursor: pointer CSS property, which doesn't provide a visual indication that the column header is clickable for sorting.
**Cause**: The default CSS styling for the table component doesn't include the cursor: pointer property for sortable column headers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor user experience due to lack of visual feedback for interactive elements
**Cause**: Missing hover state and cursor indication makes it unclear to users that the column headers are interactive elements that can be clicked to sort the table data.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is related to the UI/UX of the table's sorting functionality. The sort icons in the table headers don't have proper cursor styling (cursor: pointer) which makes it less obvious to users that these are clickable elements. This creates a suboptimal user experience as users may not immediately recognize that they can interact with these elements to sort the table data. The solution would be to add cursor: pointer CSS property to the sortable column headers to provide better visual feedback about the interactive nature of these elements.

The fix would be relatively simple:
```css
.table-header-sortable {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
This would improve the usability and discoverability of the table's sorting functionality.
