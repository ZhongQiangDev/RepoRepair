### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sorting icon in the table header does not have a `cursor: pointer` style, which means the cursor does not change to a pointer when hovering over the sorting icon.
**Cause**: The CSS for the sorting icon is missing the `cursor: pointer` property. This could be due to an oversight in the CSS styling or a deliberate choice that needs to be reconsidered for better user experience.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The sorting icon does not visually indicate that it is clickable or interactive.
**Cause**: The lack of a pointer cursor can make it unclear to users that the sorting icon is an interactive element. This can lead to confusion and a poor user experience, as users may not realize they can click the icon to sort the table.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the absence of the `cursor: pointer` style on the sorting icon in the table header. This omission affects the user experience by not clearly indicating that the icon is clickable. Adding the `cursor: pointer` property to the sorting icon's CSS will enhance usability and make it clear to users that they can interact with the icon to sort the table.
