### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Transfer component currently does not support controlling the visibility of the search boxes independently for the left and right sides.
**Cause**: The Transfer component's current implementation likely has a single configuration option for enabling or disabling the search box, which applies to both sides uniformly. There is no separate property or configuration to control each side independently.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user interface does not match the desired behavior where only the left search box is visible, and the right search box is hidden.
**Cause**: The component's UI rendering logic is not designed to handle different visibility states for the left and right search boxes. The rendering logic might be hardcoded to show both search boxes or hide both based on a single flag.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no clear documentation or API reference indicating how to control the visibility of the search boxes independently.
**Cause**: The documentation for the Transfer component might not be comprehensive enough to cover this specific use case. The API reference might lack the necessary properties or methods to control the visibility of the search boxes independently.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Transfer component currently lacks the functionality to control the visibility of the search boxes independently for the left and right sides. This is due to the component's implementation, which uses a single configuration for both sides, and the lack of a clear API or documentation to support this specific use case. To fix this, the component's implementation needs to be updated to include separate properties for controlling each side's search box visibility, and the documentation should be updated to reflect this new functionality.
