### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse does not flag the BMP image under the "serve images under next gen formats" audit.
**Cause**: The Lighthouse audit logic might not be recognizing BMP as a legacy image format that should be flagged. The audit might be focusing only on commonly used legacy formats like PNG or JPEG, and not specifically including BMP in its checks.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The BMP image is not being identified as a potential candidate for conversion to a more efficient format.
**Cause**: The Lighthouse audit might have a limited set of image formats it considers for optimization. If BMP is not included in this set, the audit will not recommend converting it to a more efficient format like WebP, even though BMP is a less efficient format.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The feature policy warning for legacy image formats does not trigger for BMP images.
**Cause**: The feature policy implementation might not be configured to recognize BMP as a legacy format. This could be due to an oversight in the policy definition or a limitation in the policy's detection capabilities.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are that Lighthouse and the feature policy are not recognizing BMP as a legacy image format that should be flagged for optimization. This could be due to limitations in the audit logic and feature policy definitions, which do not include BMP in their checks for legacy formats. To address these issues, the audit logic and feature policy should be updated to include BMP in their list of legacy formats to ensure proper flagging and optimization recommendations.
