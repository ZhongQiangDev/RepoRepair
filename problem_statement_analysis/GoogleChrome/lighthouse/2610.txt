### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: All resources in the Critical Request Chain are listed with the same size (38.18KB), which does not match the actual sizes of the resources.
**Cause**: There might be a bug in the Lighthouse tool's calculation or display logic for resource sizes in the Critical Request Chain. This could be due to an incorrect implementation or a regression in the codebase that affects how sizes are computed or presented.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The sizes listed in the Critical Request Chain do not correspond to the actual sizes of the resources as shown in the second image.
**Cause**: The discrepancy could be due to a caching issue or a misconfiguration in the way Lighthouse fetches and reports resource sizes. It's possible that the tool is using cached data or an incorrect method to determine the size of the resources, leading to the uniform size being displayed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Critical Request Chain sizes are incorrectly reported as the same value, which does not reflect the actual sizes of the resources. This could be caused by a bug in the Lighthouse tool's size calculation or display logic, or a caching/misconfiguration issue. To resolve this, the Lighthouse team should investigate the code responsible for calculating and displaying resource sizes to ensure it accurately reflects the actual sizes. Additionally, checking for any caching issues or misconfigurations in the tool's resource fetching process could help address the problem.
