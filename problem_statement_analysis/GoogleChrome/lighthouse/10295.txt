### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Lighthouse audit tool is throwing an error stating "version.match is not a function".
**Cause**: The error occurs because the `version` variable is not a string or an object that has a `match` method. This could be due to the version being `null`, `undefined`, or an object that does not have a `match` method. This might happen if the version detection logic in the Lighthouse audit tool is not correctly handling the version information returned by the website's JavaScript libraries.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Lighthouse audit tool is not correctly detecting the versions of JavaScript libraries on Magento 2 websites.
**Cause**: Magento 2 uses `require.js` and has built-in JS bundling, which may alter the way the Chrome Library Detector identifies and extracts version information from the JavaScript files. This could lead to the detector receiving incorrect or incomplete version data, causing the `version.match` error.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Browser errors are being logged to the console during the audit.
**Cause**: The presence of browser errors logged to the console suggests that there might be issues with the website's JavaScript execution environment. These errors could be related to the way the website's JavaScript is bundled or loaded, which in turn affects the Lighthouse audit tool's ability to accurately detect library versions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Lighthouse audit tool is encountering a "version.match is not a function" error when trying to detect JavaScript library versions on Magento 2 websites. This is likely due to the way Magento 2 handles JavaScript bundling and version information, which may result in the Lighthouse tool receiving incorrect or incomplete data. Additionally, browser errors logged to the console indicate potential issues with the website's JavaScript execution, further complicating the version detection process. To resolve these issues, the Lighthouse audit tool may need to be updated to better handle the specific JavaScript configurations used by Magento 2 and other similar platforms.
