### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse reports the `amp-date-picker-0.1.js` file as not being minified, even though it is minified, but contains a copyright notice with carriage returns and whitespace.
**Cause**: The Lighthouse minification audit tool is unable to accurately parse the minified JavaScript file due to the presence of the copyright notice with carriage returns and whitespace. This causes Lighthouse to overestimate the potential savings by assuming the file is not properly minified.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The copyright notice in the `amp-date-picker-0.1.js` file cannot be modified or minified as per the AMPHTML repository guidelines.
**Cause**: The AMPHTML project has a policy that the copyright notice must remain unchanged, including its formatting with carriage returns and whitespace. This policy conflicts with Lighthouse's expectations for minified JavaScript files, leading to the reported issue.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse's minification audit tool is too strict and does not account for certain formatting elements like copyright notices.
**Cause**: The minification audit tool in Lighthouse is designed to be very strict in its parsing of JavaScript files. It does not have built-in exceptions or configurations to handle specific cases like copyright notices with carriage returns and whitespace, leading to inaccurate audit results.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Lighthouse's minification audit tool is unable to accurately parse the `amp-date-picker-0.1.js` file due to the presence of a copyright notice with carriage returns and whitespace. This is compounded by the AMPHTML project's policy of not allowing changes to the copyright notice. To resolve this, Lighthouse could be updated to be more flexible in its parsing of minified JavaScript files, or the AMPHTML project could consider alternative ways to include the copyright notice that do not interfere with minification.
