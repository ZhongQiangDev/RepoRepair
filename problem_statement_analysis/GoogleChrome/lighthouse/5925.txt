Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse incorrectly reports that the AMP JavaScript file is not properly minified
**Cause**: Lighthouse's minification detection algorithm is treating the copyright notice (which contains whitespace and carriage returns) as unminified code, even though this is intentionally preserved formatting in an otherwise minified file

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse overestimates potential savings from minification
**Cause**: When Esprima (the JavaScript parser) encounters the copyright notice, it likely fails to properly parse this section, leading to inaccurate calculations of potential file size savings from minification

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: False positive in Lighthouse performance audits
**Cause**: Lighthouse's minification detection doesn't account for legitimate cases where preserved formatting (like copyright notices) is intentionally kept in otherwise minified files, leading to false warnings in performance reports

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Lighthouse's minification detection being too strict and not accounting for common real-world scenarios where some formatting is intentionally preserved (like copyright notices) in minified files. This leads to three main problems: incorrect reporting of minification status, overestimated savings calculations, and false positive warnings. The root cause appears to be limitations in both the minification detection algorithm and Esprima's parsing capabilities when dealing with mixed formatted/minified content. This affects all channels (CLI, Node, Extension, DevTools) and creates misleading performance audit results.
