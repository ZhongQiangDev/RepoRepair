Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Images are being hotlinked from remote servers instead of using local assets
**Cause**: The current implementation creates `<img>` tags that directly reference external URLs for thumbnail images, rather than using locally stored assets from the full-page screenshots (fpss)

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential Content Security Policy (CSP) violations
**Cause**: Hotlinking images from various external domains creates complications with CSP rules, especially when the report is displayed on HTTPS pages

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Mixed content issues on HTTPS pages
**Cause**: When the report is served over HTTPS but loads images from non-HTTPS sources, browsers may block the content or show security warnings due to mixed content restrictions

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Unnecessary external dependencies for thumbnail display
**Cause**: Relying on external servers for thumbnail images creates dependencies that could break if the remote content becomes unavailable, while full-page screenshots are already available locally

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the current implementation using hotlinked images for thumbnails instead of leveraging existing full-page screenshots. This creates several problems: security concerns (CSP violations and mixed content issues), unnecessary external dependencies, and potential reliability issues. The solution proposed is to modify the thumbnail generation process to use locally stored full-page screenshots instead of external image references, which would resolve all these issues simultaneously while maintaining the same visual appearance.
