### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Image elements do not have explicit `width` and `height` attributes.
**Cause**: The images are being loaded without predefined dimensions, which can cause layout shifts and negatively impact Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), a Core Web Vitals metric. This can lead to a poor user experience as the page content may jump around while images load.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Images are hotlinked from a remote server.
**Cause**: The `<img>` tags are pointing directly to images hosted on a remote server (e.g., `src="/img/community.jpg"`). This can lead to issues with Content Security Policy (CSP) and mixed content warnings, especially when the report is shown on an HTTPS site. Hotlinking can also increase the load on the remote server and may not be reliable if the remote server is down or inaccessible.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Use of thumbnails instead of fullpage screenshots.
**Cause**: The current implementation uses thumbnail images (`type=thumbnail`), which are smaller and may not provide the necessary detail. Switching to fullpage screenshots (`fpss`) would provide a more comprehensive view and simplify the handling of CSP and mixed content issues.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the lack of explicit dimensions for image elements, hotlinking of images from a remote server, and the use of thumbnails instead of fullpage screenshots. These issues can lead to poor user experience, CSP/mixed content problems, and layout shifts. Addressing these by setting explicit dimensions, using local fullpage screenshots, and avoiding hotlinking will improve the overall performance and reliability of the report.
