Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent User Agent strings between what's shown in Lighthouse's Runtime Settings and what actually appears in the web server's access logs
**Cause**: Lighthouse appears to be using different User Agent strings for different operations - one for reporting/display purposes in the Runtime Settings, and another for actually making requests to the web server. This inconsistency exists in both the Lighthouse Extension and Chrome DevTools implementations.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue appears in specific versions but not others (present in Lighthouse Extension 3.0.2 and Chrome DevTools 3.0.0-beta.0, but not in webpagetest.org)
**Cause**: This suggests there's likely a version-specific implementation difference in how User Agent strings are handled across different distributions of Lighthouse. The webpagetest.org implementation might be using a more consistent approach to User Agent handling.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of standardization in User Agent reporting across different Lighthouse implementations
**Cause**: There appears to be no standardized mechanism in place to ensure that the same User Agent string is used consistently throughout all aspects of Lighthouse's operations (reporting, network requests, etc.).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around User Agent string inconsistency in Lighthouse, manifesting in three main ways: (1) mismatched User Agents between runtime settings and actual requests, (2) version-specific inconsistencies across different Lighthouse distributions, and (3) lack of standardization in User Agent handling. While this doesn't affect the actual testing functionality, it creates confusion for users monitoring their web server logs and reduces transparency in the testing process. The fact that webpagetest.org doesn't exhibit this issue suggests this is a fixable problem that could be addressed through better standardization of User Agent handling across Lighthouse's codebase.
