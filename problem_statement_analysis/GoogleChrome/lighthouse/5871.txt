### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The user agent mentioned in the Lighthouse report's runtime settings does not match the actual user agent used in the test requests as seen in the webserver's access.log.

**Cause**: This discrepancy could be due to the way Lighthouse sets up the user agent for the audit. When Lighthouse runs, it may use a different user agent string for the actual HTTP requests compared to the one it reports in the runtime settings. This could be a result of how the user agent is configured or overridden during the audit process.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user agent mentioned in the runtime settings of the Lighthouse report does not appear in the webserver's access.log at all.

**Cause**: This issue might be caused by the way Lighthouse handles user agent strings in different environments or versions. In some cases, the user agent string reported in the runtime settings might not be the one actually used for the HTTP requests. This could be due to a bug or an inconsistency in how the user agent is set and logged during the audit process.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user agent inconsistency is observed in both the Lighthouse-Extension (3.0.2) and the built-in version of Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools (3.0.0-beta.0), but not in the Lighthouse test from webpagetest.org.

**Cause**: This could be due to differences in the implementation or configuration of Lighthouse in these different environments. The Lighthouse-Extension and the built-in version in Chrome DevTools might have specific settings or behaviors that cause the user agent inconsistency, while webpagetest.org might handle the user agent differently, leading to consistent results.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the inconsistency between the user agent mentioned in the Lighthouse report's runtime settings and the actual user agent used in the test requests. This could be caused by how Lighthouse sets up and reports the user agent during the audit process. The inconsistency is observed in specific versions of Lighthouse but not in webpagetest.org, indicating potential differences in implementation or configuration. Addressing this issue would involve ensuring that the user agent used for the HTTP requests matches the one reported in the runtime settings, providing a more accurate and consistent audit result.
