I'll analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse continues to suggest preconnect hints for origins even after they have been added to the page
**Cause**: This likely occurs because Lighthouse's audit is detecting that these connections are still having a significant impact on page load performance, despite the preconnect hints. This could mean either:
1. The preconnect hints aren't being implemented correctly
2. The browser isn't utilizing the preconnect hints effectively
3. The timing of when these resources are needed isn't aligning well with the preconnect hints

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Uncertainty about the maximum number of preconnect hints allowed
**Cause**: There is confusion around the "6 preconnects limit" because:
1. This is actually a recommendation rather than a hard technical limit
2. Browsers may have different implementations and limits
3. Too many preconnect hints can actually harm performance by consuming unnecessary CPU and network resources

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of clarity on how to identify "important third-party origins"
**Cause**: This confusion arises because:
1. Lighthouse doesn't provide clear criteria for what constitutes an "important" origin
2. The importance of an origin can vary based on:
   - Timing of resource requests
   - Size of resources
   - Impact on critical rendering path
   - Frequency of connections to that origin

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around three areas: persistent preconnect suggestions despite implementation, confusion about preconnect limits, and unclear criteria for important origins. The root causes primarily stem from:
1. Potential implementation issues with the preconnect hints
2. Lack of clear documentation about preconnect best practices
3. The complex nature of how browsers handle preconnect hints
4. The dynamic nature of performance optimization where what constitutes an "important" origin can vary based on multiple factors

To resolve these issues, better documentation from Lighthouse about its criteria and clearer guidelines about preconnect implementation would be helpful.
