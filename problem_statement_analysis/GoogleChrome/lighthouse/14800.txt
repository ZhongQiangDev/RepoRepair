### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `FrameCommittedInBrowser` event contains a `processPseudoId` instead of a `processId`, leading to `mainFramePids` only containing `undefined`.
**Cause**: The event data structure has changed or is not being correctly parsed, resulting in the absence of a valid `processId`. This could be due to a mismatch between the expected event format in Lighthouse and the actual event data provided by the browser.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse throws an error "Unable to determine tid for renderer process" when it cannot find a valid thread ID (`tid`) for the renderer process.
**Cause**: The `mainFramePids` array contains `undefined` values, which means the subsequent search for a `thread_name` event with the name `CrRendererMain` fails, leading to `tid` being `undefined`. This is likely because the `processId` is not correctly identified, preventing the proper mapping of process IDs to thread IDs.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the `FrameCommittedInBrowser` event containing a `processPseudoId` instead of a `processId`, which disrupts the expected data structure Lighthouse relies on. This results in `mainFramePids` containing `undefined`, causing the failure to find a valid `tid` for the renderer process. The mismatch between the expected event format and the actual data provided by the browser is the root cause. To resolve this, the event parsing logic in Lighthouse needs to be updated to handle `processPseudoId` appropriately, ensuring that `processId` is correctly identified and used to map to the corresponding `tid`.
