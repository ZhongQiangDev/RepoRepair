Based on the GitHub problem description, this appears to be more of a feature enhancement request rather than a bug fix. However, I'll analyze the implicit issues being addressed:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Numbers are being displayed without proper formatting for thousands separators
**Cause**: Current number output implementation likely uses basic number-to-string conversion without locale-aware formatting

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent decimal place handling across the application
**Cause**: Lack of standardized number formatting approach, possibly using manual decimal place truncation or fixed decimal places

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Numbers may not be properly formatted according to user's locale expectations
**Cause**: Direct number-to-string conversion without considering regional number formatting conventions (e.g., different thousand separators or decimal points in different countries)

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent number formatting across different parts of the application (metrics, element counts, diagnostics, kb sizes)
**Cause**: Different parts of the codebase likely handle number formatting independently, leading to inconsistent presentation

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the lack of standardized, locale-aware number formatting throughout the application. The current implementation likely uses basic number-to-string conversion methods, resulting in numbers that are harder to read and inconsistent across different contexts. The proposed solution using `toLocaleString()` would address all these issues by providing:
1. Automatic thousands separators
2. Consistent decimal place handling
3. Locale-aware formatting
4. A unified approach to number formatting across the entire application

The enhancement would improve readability and user experience by making numbers more readable and culturally appropriate for users worldwide.
