### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The 'Transfer size' column values omit the decimal place for round sizes, such as displaying `18 KiB` instead of `18.0 KiB`.
**Cause**: The current formatting logic in the code does not include a decimal place for whole numbers. This is likely due to a rounding or formatting function that is set to display only significant digits, which excludes trailing zeros.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The omission of decimal places makes it harder for users, especially those with visual impairments, to compare sizes across rows, as the digit columns do not line up.
**Cause**: The lack of consistent decimal places disrupts the visual alignment of the numbers, which can lead to misinterpretation. This is a design oversight that does not consider the accessibility needs of all users.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the inconsistent display of decimal places in the 'Transfer size' column, which is caused by the current formatting logic that excludes trailing zeros. This inconsistency affects the usability and accessibility of the size comparison feature, particularly for users with visual impairments. Addressing this by always displaying the decimal place, even for whole numbers, will improve the alignment and readability of the data, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and accessibility.
