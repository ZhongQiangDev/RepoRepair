### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The i18n text is not translated in the fatal CLI run.
**Cause**: The error message displayed is in English, indicating that the internationalization (i18n) process did not correctly translate the text into the user's preferred language. This could be due to missing or incorrect localization files, or the i18n configuration not being properly set up in the application.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The CLI run encounters a runtime error with an `INVALID_URL`.
**Cause**: The URL provided (`www.example.com`) is missing the protocol (`http://` or `https://`). This causes the application to fail when attempting to validate the URL, resulting in an `INVALID_URL` error. The application expects a fully qualified URL with a protocol specified.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Chrome instance is killed after encountering the runtime error.
**Cause**: The application is designed to terminate the Chrome instance when a fatal error occurs. This is a safety mechanism to prevent the browser from running indefinitely in an error state. However, this behavior might not be desirable if the user wants to debug the issue further or if the application could handle the error more gracefully.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the lack of i18n translation for error messages, an `INVALID_URL` error due to a missing protocol in the URL, and the termination of the Chrome instance upon encountering a runtime error. The i18n issue could be resolved by ensuring proper localization files and configuration. The `INVALID_URL` error can be fixed by providing a fully qualified URL with a protocol. The termination of the Chrome instance is a safety mechanism but could be improved for better user experience in debugging scenarios.
