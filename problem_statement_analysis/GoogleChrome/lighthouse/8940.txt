Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Image file size optimization discrepancy (54KB actual vs 53KB suggested savings)
**Cause**: The Lighthouse audit is likely suggesting that the image could be served at a smaller dimension while maintaining visual quality for the specific context where it's being used. The current image might be displayed at a smaller size than its actual dimensions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Traditional image optimization methods (like TinyPNG) aren't helping
**Cause**: The issue isn't just about compression or optimization of the existing image file. The Lighthouse recommendation is about "Properly Size Images," which refers to serving images that match their display size, rather than just reducing file size through compression.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Sprite sheet optimization challenges
**Cause**: Since the image in question is a sprite sheet (spritesheet2.png), it requires special handling because:
1. Sprite sheets contain multiple images in one file
2. They need to maintain specific dimensions for proper CSS sprite mapping
3. Traditional image optimization tools might not be optimal for sprite sheets

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of responsive image handling
**Cause**: The website might not be implementing responsive image techniques like:
- srcset attribute
- picture element
- proper image scaling for different viewport sizes
- appropriate image dimensions for different devices

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue isn't simply about reducing the file size through compression, but rather about serving appropriately sized images for their display context. The main causes revolve around:
1. Mismatch between image dimensions and display size
2. Special considerations needed for sprite sheet optimization
3. Lack of responsive image implementation
4. Focus on wrong optimization approach (compression instead of dimension optimization)

The solution would likely involve reviewing how the sprite sheet is being displayed and potentially creating multiple versions for different screen sizes or restructuring the sprite sheet entirely.
