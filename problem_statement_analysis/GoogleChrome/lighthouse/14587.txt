### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The report shows "Emulated Moto G4" instead of indicating that the test was run on a real Moto Power G device.
**Cause**: The `--no-emulatedUserAgent` flag might not be effectively disabling the user agent emulation. This could be due to a bug in Lighthouse or an issue with how the flag is being interpreted in the current version (9.6.8).

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The report does not reflect the actual device being used (Moto Power G) for testing.
**Cause**: The `--screenEmulation.disabled` flag might not be fully disabling screen emulation. This could result in Lighthouse still using default emulated settings, such as the Moto G4, instead of recognizing the physical device.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The report does not specify that the test was conducted on a real device.
**Cause**: There might be a missing or incorrectly configured flag that should explicitly tell Lighthouse to recognize and report the use of a real device. The current flags used might not be sufficient to override the default emulated settings.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The report shows "Emulated Moto G4" despite the test being run on a Moto Power G.
**Cause**: There could be an issue with the device detection mechanism in Lighthouse. It might not be correctly identifying the connected device, leading to the default emulated device (Moto G4) being reported instead.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the report incorrectly shows "Emulated Moto G4" instead of indicating the use of a real Moto Power G device. This could be due to several factors: ineffective disabling of user agent and screen emulation, missing or incorrect flags for real device recognition, or issues with device detection in Lighthouse. To resolve this, further investigation into the flag functionality and device detection mechanisms in Lighthouse is necessary. Additionally, ensuring that all relevant flags are correctly configured and that there are no bugs in the current version of Lighthouse could help address the problem.
