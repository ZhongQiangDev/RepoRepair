Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Lighthouse report displays "Emulated Moto G4" despite running the test on a physical Moto Power G device
**Cause**: Even though the user disabled screen emulation with `--screenEmulation.disabled`, Lighthouse's default device configuration is still being applied. The device metadata/identification system is not properly detecting or acknowledging the actual physical device being used for testing.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The device identification in reports doesn't reflect real device testing scenarios
**Cause**: Lighthouse's reporting system appears to be hardcoded to show emulated device information rather than having a dynamic system to detect and display real device testing information. This is likely because Lighthouse was primarily designed with emulation in mind, and the real device testing feature might not be fully integrated into the reporting system.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The command flags used (`--screenEmulation.disabled`, `--no-emulatedUserAgent`) are not effectively overriding the default emulation settings in the report
**Cause**: There might be a disconnect between the runtime configuration and the report generation system. While these flags affect the actual testing behavior, they may not be properly connected to the report template generation system that creates the final output.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Lighthouse's reporting system not being fully adapted for real device testing scenarios. While the user can run tests on physical devices, the reporting system still defaults to showing emulated device information. This appears to be a combination of:
1. Incomplete integration between real device detection and reporting
2. Default device configurations persisting despite disabling emulation
3. Command line flags not fully propagating to all parts of the system, particularly the reporting module

The solution would likely require updates to Lighthouse's device detection and reporting systems to properly identify and display real device testing scenarios.
