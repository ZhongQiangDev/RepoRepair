### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Iframes are being considered as critical requests and fetched at the highest priority.
**Cause**: The Critical Request Chain (CRC) tree is currently treating iframes as critical resources, even though they are not render-blocking. This can lead to unnecessary prioritization of iframes over other potentially more important resources, affecting the overall page load performance.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Data URIs are being included in the CRC tree.
**Cause**: Data URIs are not actual network requests and do not contribute to the critical path in the same way as other resources. Including them in the CRC tree can lead to incorrect prioritization and an inaccurate representation of the critical resources needed for rendering the page.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-leaf node data URIs are not being removed from the CRC tree.
**Cause**: While it is easy to remove leaf node data URIs, non-leaf node data URIs may have dependencies that make them harder to exclude. This can result in the inclusion of unnecessary data in the CRC tree, potentially impacting the performance analysis and optimization efforts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the incorrect prioritization of iframes as critical requests and the inclusion of data URIs in the CRC tree. These behaviors can lead to an inaccurate representation of the critical resources needed for rendering the page and can negatively impact page load performance. Addressing these issues by excluding iframes and data URIs from the CRC tree can help improve the accuracy of performance analysis and optimization efforts.
