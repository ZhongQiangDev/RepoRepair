### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The error "Cannot read property 'ts' of undefined" occurs when generating the report after the Chrome extension update.
**Cause**: The Chrome extension update may have introduced a breaking change or a bug that affects the way the extension interacts with the application's code. Specifically, the 'ts' property might be part of an object that is not being properly initialized or is undefined due to the update.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error does not occur when the application is run in the browser without the extension.
**Cause**: The Chrome extension might be injecting or modifying code that interacts with the application's internal state. After the update, this injected code might be trying to access a property ('ts') on an object that is not defined in the context of the extension, leading to the error.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error is related to the "First meaningful paint" metric.
**Cause**: The "First meaningful paint" metric might be relying on certain properties or data that are not being correctly set or are undefined after the extension update. This could be due to changes in how the extension collects or processes performance data.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue appears to be related to the Chrome extension update, which has introduced a bug or breaking change that affects the application's ability to generate reports. The error specifically points to an undefined property 'ts', which is likely part of the extension's code or data handling. The fact that the error does not occur when running the application in the browser without the extension suggests that the problem is isolated to the extension's behavior. The "First meaningful paint" metric's involvement indicates that the issue might be related to performance data collection or processing within the extension.
