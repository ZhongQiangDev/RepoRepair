### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse does not handle Out-of-Process Iframes (OOPIFs) properly.
**Cause**: Lighthouse's current implementation focuses on the main frame and does not perform target discovery for iframes, which is necessary to gather network data from OOPIFs. This is evident from the observation that Chrome DevTools uses `Target.sendMessageToTarget` to send `Network.enable` to discovered targets, but Lighthouse's source code in the `lighthouse/lighthouse-core/gather` folder does not show similar target discovery mechanisms.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse may miss network data from iframes.
**Cause**: Without proper target discovery and enabling network monitoring for iframes, Lighthouse cannot capture and analyze network requests initiated by iframes. This limitation restricts Lighthouse's ability to provide a comprehensive audit of a web page's performance and resource usage.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse's audit results may be incomplete or inaccurate.
**Cause**: If Lighthouse only analyzes the main frame and ignores iframes, especially OOPIFs, the audit results will not reflect the full picture of the web page's behavior. This can lead to inaccurate performance metrics and missing potential issues related to iframes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Lighthouse lacks the capability to handle OOPIFs effectively. This is due to the absence of target discovery mechanisms similar to those used by Chrome DevTools. As a result, Lighthouse may miss network data from iframes, leading to incomplete or inaccurate audit results. To address this, Lighthouse needs to implement target discovery and network monitoring for iframes to ensure comprehensive analysis of web pages.
