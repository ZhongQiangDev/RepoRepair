### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code snippet is not rendering correctly and includes unwanted markup.
**Cause**: The markdown characters (`_` and `[]()`) within the code snippet are being interpreted as markdown syntax, causing the text to be converted into HTML markup instead of being displayed as plain code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code snippet is not displayed in a monospace font and lacks proper syntax highlighting.
**Cause**: The code snippet is not properly enclosed within a code block or fenced code block, which is necessary for markdown to recognize it as code and apply the appropriate styling.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The code snippet is not properly indented or formatted.
**Cause**: The code snippet may not be properly indented or formatted within the markdown file, leading to incorrect rendering. Additionally, the presence of markdown characters can disrupt the formatting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that markdown characters within the code snippet are being interpreted as markdown syntax, leading to incorrect rendering. This can be fixed by ensuring the code snippet is properly enclosed within a code block or fenced code block, which will prevent markdown from interpreting the characters within the code. Additionally, proper indentation and formatting of the code snippet within the markdown file will help ensure it is displayed correctly.
