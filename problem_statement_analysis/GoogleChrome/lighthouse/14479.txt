### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The DOM size audit is displaying values with unnecessary decimal points (e.g., 2,008.0, 23.0, 81.0).
**Cause**: The code responsible for formatting the output of the DOM size audit is not correctly rounding or truncating the values to integers. This could be due to a formatting function that is set to display numbers with a fixed number of decimal places, or a lack of proper type conversion to integers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The presence of decimal points in values that should be integers can lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity in interpreting the audit results.
**Cause**: The underlying data structure or calculation method used to determine these values might be returning floating-point numbers instead of integers. This could be due to arithmetic operations that result in floating-point numbers, or a data type that is not explicitly cast to an integer.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the unnecessary display of decimal points in values that should be integers. This is likely caused by a formatting or type conversion issue in the code responsible for generating the audit results. Ensuring that the values are properly rounded or truncated to integers before display will resolve the problem and make the audit results clearer and more accurate. Additionally, reviewing the data structure and calculation methods used to determine these values can help prevent the generation of floating-point numbers where integers are expected.
