### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: User Timing marks show negative numbers.
**Cause**: The negative values for the user timing marks (`mark_features_unveil_start` and `mark_features_loaded_start`) suggest that these marks are being recorded before the performance timeline starts or before the navigation start event. This could be due to the timing marks being set before the `performance.mark()` function is properly initialized or before the page's performance timeline begins.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent timing between start and end marks.
**Cause**: The `mark_features_loaded_start` is recorded at `-184.53ms`, while `mark_features_loaded_end` is recorded at `2130.06ms`. This large gap and the negative start time indicate that the start mark is being recorded too early, possibly before the relevant script execution begins. This could be due to the script that sets the start mark being executed prematurely or due to an incorrect reference point for the start time.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Large discrepancy between measures and marks.
**Cause**: The measures (`features_loaded` and `features_unveil`) show significantly larger values compared to the corresponding end marks. This discrepancy could be due to additional processing or delays that are not accounted for in the marks, or it could be due to the measures being calculated incorrectly. It's possible that the measures are including additional time that is not relevant to the specific feature loading or unveiling process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the presence of negative values in the user timing marks, which indicate incorrect timing references, and the large discrepancies between start and end marks and between marks and measures. These issues could be caused by the timing marks being set too early, before the performance timeline starts, or by incorrect calculations of the measures. To resolve these issues, it is necessary to ensure that the timing marks are set at the correct points in the script execution and that the measures accurately reflect the time taken for the specific processes.
