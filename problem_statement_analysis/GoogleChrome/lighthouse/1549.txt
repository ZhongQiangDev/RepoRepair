Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: User timing marks are showing negative numbers in the performance timeline
**Cause**: This is likely due to incorrect calculation of time differences between performance marks and measures. The negative values suggest that the end time is being subtracted from the start time in reverse order, or there could be inconsistencies in how the timestamps are being recorded relative to the navigation start time.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The timeline visualization appears distorted due to negative values
**Cause**: The performance visualization tool likely assumes positive time values for proper rendering. When negative values are encountered, it may not handle them gracefully, leading to visual artifacts or incorrect representation of the timing data.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Performance metrics are providing meaningless data
**Cause**: The User Timing API implementation might be incorrectly handling the timing calculations, possibly due to:
1. Navigation timing API reference point issues
2. Time origin miscalculation
3. Browser inconsistencies in timestamp precision or handling

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be incorrect timing calculations resulting in negative performance measurements. This manifests in three main ways: incorrect numerical values, distorted visualizations, and meaningless performance metrics. The root cause likely stems from either implementation errors in handling the User Timing API, incorrect reference point calculations, or timing origin misalignment. To fix this, the timing calculation logic needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure proper chronological order and positive time differences between marks and measures.
