### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The ByteEfficiency report shows a score of 100 despite a significant potential saving of almost 5MB when converting an animated GIF to a video format.
**Cause**: The `computeWasteWithTTIGraph` function reports 0 savings because it only considers the impact on the estimated Time to Interactive (TTI). In this case, there is only one network request affected and no long tasks touched, which means the TTI is not significantly impacted. However, the end of the graph shows a difference of 23 seconds, indicating that the current method of calculating savings is not capturing the full impact of the optimization.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The report does not reflect the actual byte savings that could be achieved by converting the animated GIF to a video format.
**Cause**: The current method of calculating byte savings is based on the impact on TTI, which may not be the best metric for evaluating the effectiveness of converting large animated GIFs to video formats. The savings are more evident in terms of the total byte size and the overall page load time, especially when focusing on a single problematic request like a large animated GIF.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The report does not provide a clear indication of the potential performance improvement by converting the animated GIF to a video format.
**Cause**: The report focuses on the impact on TTI, which may not be the most relevant metric for this specific optimization. Other metrics, such as the total byte savings and the impact on the end of the graph or onload time, could provide a more accurate representation of the potential performance improvement.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The ByteEfficiency report is not accurately reflecting the potential savings and performance improvements when converting an animated GIF to a video format. The current method of calculating savings based on the impact on TTI is not capturing the full impact of the optimization. To address this issue, the report should consider other metrics, such as the total byte savings and the impact on the end of the graph or onload time, to provide a more accurate representation of the potential performance improvement.
