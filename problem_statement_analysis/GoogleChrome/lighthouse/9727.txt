### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The parent page (with iframe) has a higher performance score (71) compared to the child page (only iframe) which has a lower score (39), despite the iframe being the primary content and having poor performance metrics.
**Cause**: Lighthouse currently does not adequately consider the performance of iframes when calculating the overall performance score of the parent page. The metrics for the parent page are not negatively impacted by the poor performance of the iframe, leading to a misleadingly high score.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric for the parent page (0.6s) is significantly lower than the FCP for the child page (3.2s), even though the iframe content is the main content of the parent page.
**Cause**: Lighthouse may be measuring the FCP based on the initial content of the parent page, which loads quickly, and not accounting for the time it takes for the iframe content to load. This results in an inaccurate FCP metric for the parent page.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Speed Index and Time to Interactive metrics for the parent page (4.9s and 6.6s respectively) are lower than those for the child page (8.5s and 8.8s respectively), despite the iframe content being the primary content of the parent page.
**Cause**: Similar to the FCP metric, Lighthouse may not be adequately considering the time it takes for the iframe content to load when calculating the Speed Index and Time to Interactive metrics for the parent page. This results in inaccurate metrics for the parent page.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The Max Potential First Input Delay metric for the parent page (490ms) is higher than that for the child page (460ms), despite the iframe content being the primary content of the parent page.
**Cause**: Lighthouse may not be accurately measuring the input delay for the iframe content, leading to an inaccurate Max Potential First Input Delay metric for the parent page.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Lighthouse does not adequately consider the performance of iframes when calculating the overall performance score and metrics for the parent page. This leads to misleadingly high scores and inaccurate metrics for the parent page. To address this issue, Lighthouse needs to gather and evaluate the performance of iframes along with the parent page, and aggregate the results in a way that accurately reflects the overall performance of the page.
