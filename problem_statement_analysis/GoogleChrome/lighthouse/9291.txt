### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The i18n text is not translated in the fatal CLI run.
**Cause**: The error message displayed is in English and does not seem to be localized. This could be due to the i18n (internationalization) configuration not being properly set up or loaded during the CLI execution. The system might be defaulting to English because it cannot find the appropriate language files or the language setting is not correctly configured.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The CLI run encounters a runtime error with an `INVALID_URL`.
**Cause**: The error message indicates that the URL provided (`www.example.com`) is invalid. This could be due to the URL not being properly formatted. URLs should typically start with a protocol (e.g., `http://` or `https://`). The absence of the protocol might cause the system to fail in recognizing it as a valid URL.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Chrome instance is killed after waiting for the browser.
**Cause**: The Chrome instance is killed, likely because the system encountered an error during the browser launch or while waiting for it to be ready. This could be due to a timeout setting being reached, a problem with the Chrome executable, or an issue with the environment in which Chrome is being launched.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the lack of i18n translation, an invalid URL causing a runtime error, and the premature killing of the Chrome instance. The i18n issue is likely due to misconfiguration or missing language files. The invalid URL error is caused by the lack of a protocol in the URL. The Chrome instance being killed could be due to a timeout or an issue with the Chrome executable or environment. Addressing these causes should resolve the observed wrong behaviors.
