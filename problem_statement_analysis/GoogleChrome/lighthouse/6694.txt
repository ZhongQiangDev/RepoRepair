### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse suggests using `dns-prefetch` and/or `preconnect` for origins that already have `preconnect` specified in the HTML.
**Cause**: The Lighthouse audit might not be correctly identifying the `preconnect` tags in the HTML, leading to a false positive suggestion. This could be due to a bug in the audit logic or an issue with how the tags are being parsed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Lighthouse report recommends adding `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` for `https://www.google-analytics.com` and `https://fonts.googleapis.com`, despite these origins already having `preconnect` tags.
**Cause**: There might be a discrepancy between the origins specified in the `preconnect` tags and the origins identified by the Lighthouse audit. This could be due to differences in URL formatting (e.g., `https://www.google-analytics.com` vs. `https://google-analytics.com`) or other variations that the audit does not account for.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Lighthouse audit does not recognize the existing `preconnect` tags for `https://fonts.gstatic.com`.
**Cause**: The audit might be missing the `preconnect` tag for `https://fonts.gstatic.com` because it is not directly referenced in the HTML but is instead loaded through `https://fonts.googleapis.com`. This could be a limitation in the audit's ability to trace resource origins.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Lighthouse audit is generating false positive suggestions for `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch` due to potential parsing errors, URL discrepancies, and limitations in tracing resource origins. Addressing these causes would involve improving the audit's logic to correctly identify and account for existing `preconnect` tags and their associated origins.
