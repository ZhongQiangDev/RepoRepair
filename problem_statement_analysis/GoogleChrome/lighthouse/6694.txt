Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse is suggesting to use dns-prefetch/preconnect for domains that already have preconnect implemented
**Cause**: The audit system appears to not be detecting or properly parsing existing `<link rel="preconnect">` tags in the HTML, leading to false positive recommendations for performance optimization

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate recommendations for performance optimization
**Cause**: The audit logic likely doesn't have a filtering mechanism to cross-reference its recommendations against existing implementations in the page's HTML

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse suggesting a less powerful optimization (dns-prefetch) when a more powerful one (preconnect) is already in place
**Cause**: The audit system doesn't seem to understand the hierarchy of optimization techniques, where preconnect is actually a superset of dns-prefetch functionality

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is that Lighthouse 3.0.3 has a bug in its auditing system where it fails to recognize existing preconnect implementations, leading to false positive recommendations. This manifests in three ways: failing to detect existing preconnect tags, making duplicate recommendations, and suggesting less powerful optimizations when better ones are already in place. The root cause appears to be in the audit's DOM parsing and recommendation filtering logic, which needs to be updated to properly check for existing optimizations before making suggestions.
