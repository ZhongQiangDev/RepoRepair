Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse/PageSpeed is reporting incorrect CSS file size (80kb) compared to the actual gzipped size (20kb)
**Cause**: Lighthouse appears to be measuring the uncompressed size of the CSS in the DOM after it's been extracted from the JSON, rather than the actual network transfer size of the gzipped JSON file that contains the CSS

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: PageSpeed is suggesting potential savings of 70kb under "Defer unused CSS" which is inaccurate
**Cause**: The optimization recommendation algorithm is:
1. Looking at the final uncompressed CSS size in the DOM
2. Not accounting for the fact that the CSS came from an already optimized/compressed JSON delivery mechanism
3. Incorrectly calculating potential savings based on the uncompressed size rather than the actual transfer size

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Misleading performance metrics for third-party tools that dynamically inject CSS
**Cause**: Lighthouse's analysis methodology doesn't properly handle the case where:
1. CSS is delivered via compressed JSON
2. CSS is dynamically injected into the DOM
3. The actual network performance impact differs from the final DOM representation

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Lighthouse/PageSpeed's analysis methodology not properly accounting for modern delivery mechanisms of CSS, specifically when CSS is delivered via compressed JSON and dynamically injected into the DOM. The tool is measuring the uncompressed size of CSS in the DOM (80kb) rather than the actual network transfer size of the gzipped JSON (20kb), leading to incorrect size reporting and inflated potential savings calculations. This creates misleading performance metrics particularly for third-party tools that use this delivery method. The analysis needs to be updated to consider the actual network transfer size rather than just the final DOM representation of the CSS.
