Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor in the Lighthouse report meta information
**Cause**: The current implementation only shows CPU/Memory power information in the devices tooltip, but lacks screen-related emulation details that could be valuable for understanding the test environment

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Incomplete device emulation context in reports
**Cause**: The devices tooltip in the report renderer (report-renderer.js) is not utilizing all available device emulation parameters that Lighthouse captures during testing

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around incomplete device information display in Lighthouse reports. The current implementation shows basic device information like CPU and Memory throttling, but lacks important screen-related parameters (dimensions and deviceScaleFactor) that would provide more complete context about the testing environment. This is essentially a feature request to enhance the reporting capabilities by including these additional device emulation details in the meta information block, specifically in the devices tooltip. The change would help users better understand the exact conditions under which the Lighthouse audit was performed, particularly regarding screen emulation settings.

The fix would involve modifying the report renderer to include these additional device parameters in the tooltip display, making the testing environment more transparent to users.
