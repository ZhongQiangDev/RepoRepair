### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current Lighthouse report meta block does not include emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor.
**Cause**: The `devices` tooltip in the report-renderer.js file only includes CPU/Memory power and other related information, but lacks the necessary code to display emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user has requested additional information (emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor) to be included in the report meta block for better context.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the Lighthouse report does not meet the user's needs for more detailed device information, which could be crucial for understanding the performance metrics in the context of different screen sizes and scale factors.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Lighthouse report meta block is missing emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor, which are requested by the user for a more comprehensive understanding of the performance metrics. The cause is the current implementation of the `devices` tooltip in the report-renderer.js file, which needs to be updated to include the missing information. Addressing this will enhance the report's usefulness by providing more context about the device environment in which the performance metrics were measured.
