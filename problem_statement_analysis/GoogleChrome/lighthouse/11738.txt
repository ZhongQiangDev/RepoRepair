### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse doesn't wait long enough to detect the Cumulative Layout Shift for some pages.
**Cause**: The `throttlingMethod` is set to `simulate`, which may not accurately reflect real-world network conditions. This can cause Lighthouse to prematurely conclude that the page has finished loading, leading to an incomplete or inaccurate measurement of the Cumulative Layout Shift.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Cumulative Layout Shift score is reported as 0, which is not expected given the page's actual loading behavior.
**Cause**: The page might have dynamic content or elements that load after the initial page load, causing layout shifts. However, Lighthouse might not be waiting long enough to capture these shifts, especially when using the `simulate` throttling method.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The performance score is based only on the metrics that Lighthouse detects, which may not fully represent the user experience.
**Cause**: If Lighthouse is not capturing all relevant metrics due to insufficient waiting time or incorrect throttling settings, the performance score will not accurately reflect the true performance of the page. This can lead to misleading performance assessments.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Lighthouse, when using the `simulate` throttling method, may not wait long enough to accurately measure the Cumulative Layout Shift and other performance metrics. This can result in an incomplete or inaccurate performance score. To address this, it may be necessary to adjust the throttling settings or increase the waiting time to ensure that all relevant metrics are captured. Additionally, verifying the page's actual loading behavior and comparing it with Lighthouse's measurements can help identify any discrepancies and guide further improvements.
