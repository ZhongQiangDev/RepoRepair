Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate stack packs appearing in the Lighthouse/PSI report for the same library
**Cause**: Loose coupling in the code that matches library identifiers. Specifically, the code in stack-collector.js uses a very loose matching system without proper unique identifiers, causing multiple entries to be created for the same library.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Experimental "React (Fast Path)" entries being shown to users in the best practices/js-libraries audit
**Cause**: The new "Fast Path" checks added to js-lib-detector are being displayed in user-facing reports when they were intended to be internal/experimental features only. This occurred after merging the Fast Path detection feature without proper visibility controls.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of proper identification system for library detection
**Cause**: The js-library-detector lacks proper `id` properties for uniquely identifying libraries, leading to potential conflicts and duplicate detections when different detection methods (regular and Fast Path) are used for the same library.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from three main problems: 1) A loose coupling system causing duplicate stack packs, 2) Unintended exposure of experimental Fast Path detection results to users, and 3) Absence of a proper library identification system. The root cause appears to be the recent addition of Fast Path checks without proper integration considerations for the existing library detection system. The solution requires adding proper ID properties to js-library-detector, improving the coupling mechanism, and implementing a way to hide experimental detection methods from user-facing reports while still maintaining the data for internal use.
