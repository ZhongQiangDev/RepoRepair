### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicated stack packs are being displayed in the Minify JavaScript audit.
**Cause**: The addition of the "Fast Path" checks in the js-library-detector has introduced a new stack pack for React, but the existing stack pack for React is still being used. This results in two identical stack packs being displayed, causing duplication.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The new experimental `React (Fast Path)` entries are being shown to users within the bestpractices/js-libraries audit.
**Cause**: The new "Fast Path" checks were intended to be experimental and not user-visible. However, they are currently being exposed in the audit results, which was not the intended behavior. This is likely due to a lack of proper filtering or configuration to hide these experimental entries from the user interface.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: 
- The duplication of stack packs is caused by the introduction of a new "Fast Path" check in the js-library-detector, which adds a new stack pack for React without properly deprecating or merging the existing one.
- The visibility of experimental `React (Fast Path)` entries in the audit results is due to a configuration issue where these entries are not being properly hidden from the user interface. This needs to be addressed by either filtering out these entries or providing a mechanism to expose them only in the JSON output and not in the user interface.
