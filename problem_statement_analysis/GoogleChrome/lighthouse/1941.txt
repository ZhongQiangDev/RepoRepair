### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `String.replace` method is causing the JavaScript injection to escape the page when a special character like `$` is inserted into the replacement string.
**Cause**: The `String.replace` method treats certain special characters, such as `$`, as placeholders for parts of the original string. When the replacement string contains a `$`, it is interpreted as a placeholder rather than a literal character, leading to unexpected behavior and potential injection vulnerabilities.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The page is not properly handling the injected JavaScript code, allowing it to execute and modify the page content.
**Cause**: The code that processes the replacement string does not sanitize or escape special characters, such as `$`, before using them in the `String.replace` method. This allows the injected code to be interpreted as part of the replacement pattern, leading to the execution of unintended JavaScript code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The page content is being modified in an unintended way due to the injection of `console.log('$');`.
**Cause**: The `console.log('$');` statement is being inserted into the JavaScript file content, which is then used as the replacement string in the `String.replace` method. The `$` character in the replacement string is being interpreted as a placeholder, causing the injected code to be executed and modifying the page content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `String.replace` method is not properly handling special characters in the replacement string, leading to JavaScript injection vulnerabilities. The code that processes the replacement string should sanitize or escape special characters before using them in the `String.replace` method to prevent unintended behavior and injection attacks. Additionally, the page should properly handle and validate any injected code to ensure that it does not modify the page content in an unintended way.
