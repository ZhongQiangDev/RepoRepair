### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: NO_FCP error when the tab is in the background.
**Cause**: Lighthouse requires the tab to be in the foreground to accurately measure performance metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP). When the tab is in the background, the browser may throttle or pause certain processes, leading to inaccurate or incomplete measurements.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Performance and Progressive Web App metrics are not evaluated.
**Cause**: The NO_FCP error prevents Lighthouse from completing the performance audit. Since FCP is a critical metric for performance evaluation, its failure causes the entire performance audit to fail. Similarly, the Progressive Web App audit may depend on successful performance metrics, leading to its failure as well.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error persists across different environments and profiles.
**Cause**: The issue is likely related to the Lighthouse extension's interaction with the browser rather than a specific environment or profile setting. The extension may not be properly handling background tabs or may have a bug that affects its ability to measure performance in such scenarios.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: CLI works fine while the extension does not.
**Cause**: The Lighthouse CLI and extension may have different implementations or configurations. The CLI might not have the same limitations as the extension when it comes to measuring performance in background tabs. This discrepancy suggests a potential bug or limitation in the extension's code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the NO_FCP error when the tab is in the background, which prevents Lighthouse from accurately measuring performance metrics. This error affects both the Performance and Progressive Web App audits and persists across different environments and profiles. The discrepancy between the CLI and extension suggests a potential bug or limitation in the extension's handling of background tabs. Addressing this issue would likely involve updating the extension to properly handle background tabs or providing a clear warning to users about the need to keep the tab in the foreground during audits.
