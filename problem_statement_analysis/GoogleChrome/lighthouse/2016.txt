Let me analyze the GitHub issue based on the screenshot provided.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown arrow/details element is shown even when there are 0 passing audits
**Cause**: The UI logic likely doesn't have a condition to hide the dropdown element when the count is zero, treating it the same as cases with non-zero passing audits

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Showing "0 passing" with an expandable dropdown is misleading to users
**Cause**: The current implementation appears to use the same UI component template regardless of the audit count, which creates a confusing user experience when there's nothing to actually expand/show

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from treating zero-count audit results the same way as non-zero results in the UI. This creates both a technical inconsistency (showing an expandable element with no content) and a UX problem (misleading users with a dropdown that shouldn't exist). The fix would likely involve adding a condition to hide or disable the dropdown functionality when the audit count is zero.
