### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "View 0 passed items" dropdown is visible even when there are no passing audits.
**Cause**: The UI logic for showing the "View 0 passed items" dropdown is not correctly checking the number of passing audits.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown may confuse users as it suggests there are items to view when there are none.
**Cause**: The design or implementation of the dropdown does not account for the scenario where there are zero passing audits, leading to a misleading user interface.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the "View 0 passed items" dropdown is visible despite there being no passing audits. This is caused by a flaw in the UI logic that fails to hide or disable the dropdown when there are no passing items. Additionally, the design does not handle this edge case, leading to a confusing user experience. To resolve this, the UI logic should be updated to check for the number of passing audits and hide the dropdown when it is zero.
