From the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Redirects opportunity" text appears visually compressed/squished in the report interface
**Cause**: This appears to be a CSS/styling issue where either:
1. The container width is too narrow for the text content
2. Improper text wrapping settings are applied
3. Font spacing or letter-spacing properties may be incorrectly set

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Text readability is compromised due to compression
**Cause**: The layout container likely has fixed width constraints that aren't properly handling longer text strings, causing the text to compress rather than wrap or expand appropriately

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be a UI/layout problem where text content is being compressed instead of properly handled through text wrapping or container expansion. This is likely due to CSS styling constraints or container width limitations that need to be adjusted to properly accommodate varying text lengths. The fix would involve either:
1. Implementing proper text wrapping
2. Adjusting container widths
3. Reviewing and updating text spacing properties
4. Ensuring responsive design principles are applied to handle different text lengths

The issue seems to be primarily cosmetic but impacts readability and user experience.
