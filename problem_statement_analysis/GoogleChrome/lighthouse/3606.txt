### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The audit is erroneously reporting that text compression should be enabled, even though gzip compression is already in use.
**Cause**: There might be a discrepancy or bug in the audit tool's detection mechanism. The tool may not be correctly identifying the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header in the response, leading it to incorrectly flag the resource as uncompressed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The audit tool is suggesting a significant amount of potential savings (78-79%) from enabling gzip compression, despite gzip already being enabled.
**Cause**: The audit tool might be miscalculating the potential savings. It could be comparing the uncompressed size of the resource to a hypothetical compressed size, without recognizing that the resource is already compressed. This could be due to a flaw in the tool's logic for calculating compression savings.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the audit tool is not correctly recognizing that gzip compression is already enabled for the resource. This leads to an incorrect recommendation to enable text compression and an overestimation of the potential savings from compression. The root cause appears to be a bug or flaw in the audit tool's detection and calculation mechanisms. To resolve this, the audit tool's logic for detecting compression and calculating savings should be reviewed and corrected.
