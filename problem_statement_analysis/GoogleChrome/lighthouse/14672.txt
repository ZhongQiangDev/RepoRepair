### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Devtools incorrectly shows "no emulation" for mobile runs.
**Cause**: The function `getEmulationDescriptions` was modified in #14515 to return "no emulation" when `screenEmulation.disabled` is true. This condition is met in `devtools-entry.js`, where `screenEmulation.disabled` is set to true for devtools. As a result, the devtools incorrectly display "no emulation" even when mobile emulation is intended.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The display of "no emulation" does not reflect the actual state of the mobile run.
**Cause**: The logic in `getEmulationDescriptions` does not differentiate between the intended use of `screenEmulation.disabled` for devtools and the actual emulation state during a mobile run. This leads to a mismatch between the actual emulation settings and the displayed information.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the modification in #14515 to `getEmulationDescriptions` causes devtools to display "no emulation" when `screenEmulation.disabled` is true, which is set in `devtools-entry.js`. This results in incorrect information being shown during mobile runs. The cause lies in the lack of differentiation between the intended use of `screenEmulation.disabled` for devtools and the actual emulation state. To resolve this, the logic in `getEmulationDescriptions` needs to be refined to accurately reflect the actual emulation state during mobile runs.
