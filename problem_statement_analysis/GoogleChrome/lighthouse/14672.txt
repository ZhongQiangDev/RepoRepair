Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Devtools displays "no emulation" message for mobile runs when it should show mobile emulation settings
**Cause**: The change in `getEmulationDescriptions` function (from PR #14515) was modified to return "no emulation" whenever screenEmulation.disabled is set to true. This setting is being triggered in `devtools-entry.js`, causing incorrect display status even during mobile emulation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between actual emulation state and displayed state in DevTools
**Cause**: The logic in `devtools-entry.js` is setting screenEmulation.disabled to true by default, which conflicts with the mobile emulation settings. This creates a mismatch between the actual emulation being performed and what's being shown in the UI.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a change in PR #14515 that modified how emulation status is displayed. The main problems are:
1. Incorrect display logic in `getEmulationDescriptions` that relies solely on screenEmulation.disabled flag
2. Conflicting settings between `devtools-entry.js` and mobile emulation configurations

The fix would likely require either:
- Modifying the condition in `getEmulationDescriptions` to consider mobile emulation state
- Adjusting how screenEmulation.disabled is handled in `devtools-entry.js` for mobile runs
- Or implementing a more comprehensive check for emulation status that accounts for both mobile and screen emulation settings
