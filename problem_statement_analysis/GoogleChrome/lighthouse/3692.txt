Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Performance metrics in reports may be inaccurate or misleading when using headless Chrome
**Cause**: Headless Chrome environments can produce different performance characteristics compared to regular Chrome browsers due to different resource allocation, system configurations, and lack of real browser rendering environment

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users are not aware that performance numbers might be affected by using headless Chrome
**Cause**: There is currently no warning or notification system in place to inform users that the performance metrics were collected using headless Chrome, which could lead to misinterpretation of results

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Performance-related information is scattered across different sections of the report
**Cause**: The current report structure has performance audits distributed in various categories, making it harder to provide a consolidated warning about headless Chrome's impact on performance metrics

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the potential inaccuracy of performance metrics when using headless Chrome and the lack of proper user notification about this limitation. The problem is compounded by the scattered nature of performance-related information across the report. The proposed solution is to add a prominent warning at the top of the report rather than just in the performance section, ensuring users are well-informed about potential discrepancies in the metrics. This placement decision is justified by the visibility needs and the distributed nature of performance-related audits throughout the report.

The question about whether the module should also throw a warning remains open for discussion, but would provide an additional layer of user notification through the programmatic interface.
