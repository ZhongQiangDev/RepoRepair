### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Progressive Web App" gauge is not filled in, unlike the other gauges which are partially or fully filled.
**Cause**: The PWA score might be missing or not calculated properly, leading to the gauge not being filled. This could be due to an issue in the scoring algorithm or data retrieval for the PWA metric.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Progressive Web App" gauge has a different design compared to the other gauges (it has a different color and lacks a numerical score).
**Cause**: There might be a styling issue in the CSS or HTML code responsible for rendering the PWA gauge. This could be due to a missing class, incorrect class application, or a specific condition in the code that is not being met for the PWA gauge.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Progressive Web App" gauge is not aligned properly with the other gauges.
**Cause**: There could be a layout issue in the CSS or HTML code. The gauge might not be properly centered or aligned due to incorrect margin, padding, or positioning properties.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues with the PWA header gauge include a missing or incorrect score, a different design compared to other gauges, and improper alignment. These issues are likely caused by problems in the scoring algorithm, styling code, and layout code. Addressing these causes should resolve the style issues with the PWA header gauge.
