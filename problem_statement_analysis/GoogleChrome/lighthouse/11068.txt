Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse is unable to automatically check font-display values for multiple font URLs from Google Fonts and Disqus CDN
**Cause**: The CSSUsage artifact doesn't contain any stylesheets that reference these fonts, suggesting that the font references are either:
1. Loaded dynamically
2. Located within iframes
3. Not properly captured during the CSS usage collection phase

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Font-display audit warnings specifically appearing for iframes (as mentioned in the title)
**Cause**: The cross-origin iframes (indicated by OOPIF - Out of Process IFrames in the test URL) create a separate context that makes it difficult for Lighthouse to:
1. Access and analyze CSS rules within those iframes
2. Track font loading behavior across frame boundaries
3. Properly collect font-related stylesheet information

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The audit system cannot track font resources across different origins
**Cause**: The fonts are being loaded from different domains (fonts.gstatic.com and c.disquscdn.com), which creates cross-origin resource sharing complications that may prevent Lighthouse from:
1. Accessing the font-display properties
2. Properly analyzing the font loading strategies
3. Collecting complete stylesheet information across different origins

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around Lighthouse's inability to properly audit font-display values in a complex web environment involving iframes and cross-origin resources. The main causes are:
1. Limitations in collecting CSS usage data from iframes
2. Cross-origin restrictions affecting font resource analysis
3. Possible gaps in the CSS artifact collection process
4. The distributed nature of font resources across different domains
The problem appears to be a pre-existing bug related to how Lighthouse handles font auditing in more complex webpage structures, particularly those involving iframes and cross-origin resources.
