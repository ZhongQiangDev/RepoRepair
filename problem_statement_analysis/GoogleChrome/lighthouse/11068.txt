### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse is unable to automatically check the font-display value for multiple font URLs.
**Cause**: The CSSUsage artifact does not have any stylesheets referencing these fonts. This could be due to the fonts being loaded dynamically or not being properly linked in the CSS files that Lighthouse is analyzing.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The font-display audit warnings are specifically for iframes.
**Cause**: Iframes may have their own separate stylesheets or font loading mechanisms that are not being properly detected or analyzed by Lighthouse. This could be due to the iframe content being loaded from a different domain or having a different structure that Lighthouse is not accounting for.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue was noticed during the migration to flatten protocol.
**Cause**: The migration to flatten protocol may have introduced changes in how fonts are loaded or referenced, which could have caused Lighthouse to be unable to properly check the font-display values. This could be due to changes in the URL structure, file paths, or the way the fonts are being embedded in the HTML.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are that Lighthouse is unable to check the font-display values for multiple font URLs, specifically for iframes, and this issue was noticed during a migration to flatten protocol. The causes include the CSSUsage artifact not having stylesheets referencing the fonts, iframes having separate font loading mechanisms, and changes introduced during the migration to flatten protocol. Addressing these causes will likely involve ensuring that the fonts are properly referenced in the CSS files, properly detecting and analyzing iframe content, and accounting for any changes introduced during the migration.
