### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `mailto:` link with `rel="noopener"` fails to open the email client on Chrome for Android and iOS Safari.
**Cause**: The `rel="noopener"` attribute is causing the issue. This attribute is typically used to prevent the new page from gaining access to the window object of the original page, which can help prevent certain types of security vulnerabilities. However, it seems that when used with `mailto:` links, it interferes with the expected behavior of opening the default email client.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `mailto:` link without `rel="noopener"` works correctly and opens the email client.
**Cause**: The absence of the `rel="noopener"` attribute allows the `mailto:` link to function as intended. Without this attribute, the browser can properly handle the `mailto:` protocol and open the default email client.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue arises specifically when the `rel="noopener"` attribute is applied to `mailto:` links. This attribute, while beneficial for security and performance in other contexts, disrupts the expected behavior of `mailto:` links on certain browsers like Chrome for Android and iOS Safari. Removing the `rel="noopener"` attribute resolves the problem, allowing the `mailto:` links to open the email client as intended. Therefore, it is recommended to exclude `rel="noopener"` from `mailto:` links to ensure they work correctly across different platforms.
