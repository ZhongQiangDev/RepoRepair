Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Increased error rate on the LR backend
**Cause**: The system is hitting the 60-second timeout limit more frequently, as shown by the spike in the red line of the error rate graph.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Increased latency in loadPage-defaultPass timing
**Cause**: The 95th percentile graph shows that `loadPage-defaultPass` has made a significant jump in timing, while other metrics like `lh:runner:auditing` remained stable. This suggests a specific performance degradation in the page loading process.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: More occurrences of NO_FCP (No First Contentful Paint) errors
**Cause**: The recent code change in PR #6944 "core(driver): waitForFCP when tracing" is likely causing the system to wait longer for First Contentful Paint, leading to more sites hitting the 35-second maxWaitForLoad timeout and subsequently the 60-second render timeout.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing timing data for failed runs
**Cause**: The monitoring system's design limitation where runs that error out don't report their timings, potentially hiding issues with gatherers that take long times (e.g., 45 seconds) to complete.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a recent code change that modified FCP waiting behavior, causing a cascade of timeout-related problems. This manifests as increased error rates, longer page load times, and more NO_FCP errors. The situation is compounded by monitoring limitations that mask timing data from failed runs. The primary focus should be on implementing a threshold for FCP waiting time and potentially revisiting the timeout limits or the FCP waiting mechanism introduced in PR #6944.
