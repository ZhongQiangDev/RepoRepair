### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Excessive User Timing Marks Injected by Google Ads
**Cause**: Google Ads is injecting a large number of User Timing marks and measures into the page, which can clutter performance metrics and make it difficult to identify relevant performance data. This behavior is likely due to the way Google Ads scripts are designed to track various events and performance metrics for ad delivery and rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unclear Basis for Filtering Irrelevant User Timing Marks
**Cause**: There is no clear or standardized method for determining which User Timing marks are relevant and which are not. This lack of clarity can lead to either filtering out important data or retaining irrelevant data, both of which can negatively impact performance analysis. The current approach may rely on hardcoded rules, which may not be flexible or adaptable to different scenarios.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the excessive injection of User Timing marks by Google Ads, which complicates performance analysis. This is caused by the design of Google Ads scripts. Additionally, there is a lack of a clear and standardized method for filtering irrelevant User Timing marks, which can lead to either the loss of important data or the retention of irrelevant data. Addressing these issues requires a more robust and flexible filtering mechanism that can adapt to different scenarios and effectively distinguish between relevant and irrelevant User Timing marks.
