Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse is flagging local file resources (file:///) as render-blocking resources in its performance audit
**Cause**: Lighthouse's audit logic appears to be incorrectly processing local file URLs (file:/// protocol) the same way as network resources, even though browsers block local file access for security reasons. This leads to false positive warnings about render-blocking resources.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The performance recommendations are inaccurate for local resources
**Cause**: The audit tool doesn't have special handling logic to distinguish between local file system resources and network resources, resulting in inappropriate optimization suggestions that can't actually be applied to local files.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Security restrictions are not properly considered in the audit
**Cause**: Modern browsers block access to local files by default as a security measure, but Lighthouse's analysis doesn't take this security constraint into account when generating its recommendations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Lighthouse not properly handling local file resources (file:/// protocol) in its performance audits. This manifests in three main ways: incorrect flagging of render-blocking resources, inappropriate performance recommendations, and failure to account for browser security restrictions. The root cause appears to be a lack of special logic in Lighthouse to properly handle local file resources differently from network resources. This has been acknowledged as a bug by the Lighthouse team (@patrickhulce). The issue affects Lighthouse version 8.1.0 running on Chrome 90 with Node v16.2.0.
