### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The report page is blank.
**Cause**: The JavaScript console shows an "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token" error. This error suggests that there is a syntax issue in the JavaScript code that is preventing the report from rendering properly. The syntax error could be due to malformed JSON, incorrect characters, or other syntax issues in the code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The report page is blank.
**Cause**: The JavaScript console also shows an "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'generatedTime' of undefined" error. This error indicates that the code is trying to access a property of an object that is not defined. This could be due to the report data not being properly loaded or initialized, leading to the report page being unable to display any content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The blank report page is caused by two main issues: a syntax error in the JavaScript code and a type error due to an undefined object. The syntax error needs to be fixed by identifying and correcting the malformed code, while the type error requires ensuring that the report data is properly loaded and initialized before attempting to access its properties. Addressing these issues should allow the report page to display the expected content.
