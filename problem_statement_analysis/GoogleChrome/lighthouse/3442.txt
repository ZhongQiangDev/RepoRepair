Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The report page is completely blank/empty despite successful execution
**Cause**: This could be due to:
- JavaScript rendering issues where the content is not being properly rendered to the page
- Missing or failed data loading from the backend
- CSS styling issues making the content invisible
- DOM elements not being properly created or attached

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No error messages are displayed despite the page being blank
**Cause**: This suggests:
- Error handling may not be properly implemented
- Silent failures in the code where errors are being caught but not displayed
- Missing error logging or user feedback mechanisms

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue occurs in both CLI and browser extension environments
**Cause**: Since it happens in both contexts, likely causes are:
- Core functionality issues in shared code between both implementations
- Data processing or report generation logic problems that are environment-independent
- Configuration issues that affect both deployment methods

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be a blank report page that manifests in both CLI and browser extension contexts. The root causes likely stem from either fundamental rendering issues, data loading problems, or shared codebase issues that affect both deployment methods. The lack of error messages makes debugging more challenging and suggests improvements are needed in error handling. Since the problem occurs consistently across different environments, the focus should be on investigating the core report generation and display logic rather than environment-specific implementations.
