Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The minification-estimator incorrectly reports that minified JavaScript code is not minified.
**Cause**: The tool fails to properly recognize the code pattern `case/^hello!/.test("hello!")` as valid minified code, instead misinterpreting parts of it as comments.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The forward slash (/) after "case" is incorrectly identified as a division operator.
**Cause**: The `hasPunctuatorBefore` function's logic is incomplete. The `PUNCTUATOR_REGEX` doesn't include the keyword "case" in its pattern, causing it to fail to recognize that the following "/" is part of a regular expression rather than a division operator.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Code after the first "/" is being treated as a comment.
**Cause**: Due to the misidentification of the first "/", the parser then incorrectly interprets the subsequent "//" as the start of a comment, causing all following code to be treated as commented content rather than executable code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the minification-estimator's inability to properly parse regular expressions in certain contexts, specifically after the "case" keyword. This is caused by an incomplete `PUNCTUATOR_REGEX` pattern that doesn't account for all possible JavaScript keywords that can precede a regular expression. The cascading effect of this initial misidentification leads to further parsing errors, where valid code is treated as comments. The proposed solution correctly addresses this by adding the "case" keyword to the `PUNCTUATOR_REGEX` pattern, allowing the parser to properly identify regular expressions in switch-case statements.
