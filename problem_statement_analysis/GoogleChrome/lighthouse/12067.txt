### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse incorrectly reports that the JavaScript code is not minified.
**Cause**: The `hasPunctuatorBefore` function in `minification-estimator.js` misinterprets the `/` character after the `case` keyword as a division operator instead of recognizing it as the start of a regular expression. This misinterpretation leads to the subsequent `//` being treated as the start of a comment, causing the rest of the code to be ignored.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `PUNCTUATOR_REGEX` does not include the `case` keyword, leading to incorrect parsing of the JavaScript code.
**Cause**: The `PUNCTUATOR_REGEX` is missing the `case` keyword, which is necessary to correctly identify the context of the `/` character following `case`. This omission causes the function to fail in recognizing the regular expression syntax correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `hasPunctuatorBefore` function in `minification-estimator.js` fails to correctly parse the JavaScript code due to the absence of the `case` keyword in the `PUNCTUATOR_REGEX`. This results in the misinterpretation of the `/` character as a division operator instead of recognizing it as part of a regular expression. Adding the `case` keyword to the `PUNCTUATOR_REGEX` will resolve the parsing issue and ensure that the JavaScript code is correctly identified as minified.
