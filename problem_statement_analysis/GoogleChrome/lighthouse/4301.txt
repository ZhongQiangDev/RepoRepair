### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse hangs indefinitely on "Loading page & waiting for onload" during the "Progressive Web App" test.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to the service worker implementation on the website. If the service worker is not properly configured or has a long-running task that prevents the page from fully loading, it can cause Lighthouse to hang. Additionally, if the service worker is caching resources incorrectly or taking too long to respond, it can also lead to this behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem persists across both the native audit and the Lighthouse extension.
**Cause**: This suggests that the issue is not specific to a particular tool but rather a fundamental problem with the website's configuration or the environment in which it is being tested. It could be due to network issues, server-side problems, or client-side JavaScript that is preventing the page from fully loading.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is not resolved despite previous fixes for HSTS-related problems.
**Cause**: Although HSTS issues were previously identified and fixed, there might be other security-related configurations or headers that are causing the problem. For example, if the server is returning incorrect or conflicting headers, it can cause the browser to hang while waiting for the page to load.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem occurs on all pages of the site.
**Cause**: This indicates that the issue is likely related to a global configuration or a common resource that is used across all pages. It could be a shared JavaScript file, a common service worker, or a global server-side configuration that is causing the problem.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Lighthouse audit is hanging indefinitely on "Loading page & waiting for onload" due to potential issues with the service worker implementation, network/server-side problems, security-related configurations, or a common resource used across all pages. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to review the service worker implementation, check for any long-running tasks or caching issues, ensure that the server is returning correct headers, and verify that there are no network or server-side problems. Additionally, it may be helpful to test the site in a different environment or with different configurations to isolate the problem.
