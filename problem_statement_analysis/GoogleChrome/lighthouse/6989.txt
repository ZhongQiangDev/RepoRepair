### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Warnings within the "Passed Audits" section are not clearly visible or highlighted.
**Cause**: The current design does not adequately differentiate warnings from other audit results, leading to potential oversight of important issues.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warnings are not immediately noticeable, which could lead users to miss critical information.
**Cause**: The visual design lacks a distinct visual cue or section to draw attention to warnings, making them blend in with the rest of the audit results.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The warnings are not grouped or presented in a way that emphasizes their importance.
**Cause**: The current layout does not prioritize warnings, which could result in users overlooking them while focusing on other audit results.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are the lack of visibility and emphasis on warnings within the "Passed Audits" section. The current design does not adequately differentiate, highlight, or prioritize warnings, which could lead to users missing important information. Improving the visual design and layout to better highlight warnings is necessary to ensure they are noticed and addressed.
