Let me analyze the GitHub issue description and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Warnings within Passed Audits are not clearly visible to users
**Cause**: The current UI design doesn't have a dedicated space or visual treatment to display warnings that occur within audits that otherwise passed their main checks

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Important warning information could be overlooked by users
**Cause**: When warnings are embedded within passed audits, users might assume everything is fine since it's in the "Passed" section and miss potential issues that still need attention

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of clear separation between passed status and warning messages
**Cause**: The current UI structure doesn't provide a clear visual hierarchy or distinction between successful audit results and their associated warnings

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the visibility and presentation of warnings in Lighthouse's audit report, specifically for items that technically passed but have important caveats or warnings. The proposed solution is to create a dedicated warning block following the "Passed Audits" section to ensure these warnings are properly highlighted and don't get overlooked. This change will be implemented after other visual and structural changes are completed in PR #5270. The core problems stem from UI/UX design limitations that don't effectively communicate partial or qualified success states to users.
