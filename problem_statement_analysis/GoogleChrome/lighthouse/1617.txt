### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The manifest's short name length validation is reporting a false positive when the short name is missing.
**Cause**: The validation logic is not correctly handling the case where the short name is absent. It seems to be checking for the length of the short name without first verifying if the short name exists. This results in a misleading error message stating that the short name exceeds the suggested maximum length, even though the short name is not present.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message suggests a maximum length for the short name but does not clarify that the short name is actually missing.
**Cause**: The error message is not informative enough. It should indicate that the short name is missing instead of just stating the length issue. This lack of clarity can confuse users who might think they need to adjust the length of a non-existent short name.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the validation logic for the manifest's short name length is flawed, leading to a false positive when the short name is missing. The cause is the absence of a check to ensure the short name exists before validating its length. Additionally, the error message is not clear about the actual problem, which is the missing short name, leading to user confusion. To fix this, the validation should first check for the existence of the short name and provide a clear error message if it is missing.
