### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The offscreen images audit flags an SVG file with 0 area.
**Cause**: The SVG file may not have proper dimensions defined, leading the audit to interpret it as having 0 area. This could be due to missing or incorrect `width` and `height` attributes in the SVG code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The audit flags the SVG file as having invalid image sizing information.
**Cause**: The SVG file might be using relative units (like percentages) or may not have explicit sizing information, causing the audit tool to fail in determining the correct dimensions. This can also happen if the SVG is embedded in a way that doesn't pass along the necessary sizing context.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the SVG file's sizing information. The audit flags the SVG due to missing or incorrect dimensions, leading to a 0 area interpretation and invalid sizing information. To resolve these issues, the SVG should have explicit `width` and `height` attributes defined, ensuring the audit tool can correctly interpret its dimensions. Additionally, ensuring the SVG is embedded with the correct sizing context can prevent the audit from flagging it as having invalid sizing information.
