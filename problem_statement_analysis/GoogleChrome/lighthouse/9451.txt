### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse reports that the start URL does not load offline but the current page does.
**Cause**: The desktop version of the page is loaded during the offline pass, and the `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` flags on all network requests are `false`. This indicates that the page is not being served from a service worker or disk cache as expected when offline. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the service worker or caching strategy, or an issue with how Lighthouse simulates the offline environment.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The desktop version of the page is loaded during the offline pass instead of the expected mobile version.
**Cause**: The site may not be properly configured to serve the mobile version of the page when offline. This could be due to a lack of responsive design or a failure in the site's media queries and viewport settings to adapt to different screen sizes and offline conditions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` flags are `false` for all network requests during the offline pass.
**Cause**: This suggests that the service worker is not correctly intercepting and serving cached resources when the network is unavailable. It could be due to an error in the service worker's caching logic, such as not caching the necessary resources or not serving them correctly when offline. Alternatively, there might be an issue with how Lighthouse interacts with the service worker during the offline simulation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the incorrect loading of the desktop version during the offline pass and the failure of the service worker to serve cached resources. These problems could stem from misconfigurations in the service worker, caching strategies, or how Lighthouse simulates the offline environment. Addressing these issues will require reviewing the site's service worker implementation, caching logic, and ensuring that Lighthouse's offline simulation accurately reflects real-world offline conditions.
