Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lighthouse incorrectly reports that the current page loads offline while the start URL doesn't
**Cause**: There appears to be an inconsistency in how Lighthouse is evaluating offline capabilities between the start URL and current page checks, leading to contradictory results

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Desktop version of the page loads during offline pass
**Cause**: The service worker doesn't seem to be properly intercepting requests during the offline test, as evidenced by the `fromServiceWorker` flag being false

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Network requests during offline pass show `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` as false
**Cause**: This indicates that the offline testing mechanism in Lighthouse isn't properly simulating offline conditions, as these flags should be true if the content was truly being served offline

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Offline fallback page is not displayed
**Cause**: The service worker's offline fallback mechanism isn't being triggered properly during the test, resulting in the desktop version being shown instead of the expected offline page

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be problems with Lighthouse's offline testing implementation. The main symptoms are inconsistent offline reporting, improper service worker behavior, and incorrect network request flagging. These issues suggest that either the offline simulation isn't working correctly or there's a bug in how Lighthouse interacts with the service worker during offline testing. The fact that network requests show neither service worker nor disk cache involvement during an offline test particularly indicates a fundamental problem with the offline testing mechanism.
