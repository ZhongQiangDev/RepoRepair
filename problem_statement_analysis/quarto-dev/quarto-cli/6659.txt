Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The figure disappears completely from the output when `fig-cap` evaluates to `character(0)`.
**Cause**: The rendering engine (Quarto/knitr) is not handling empty/zero-length character vectors properly for figure captions. Instead of treating `character(0)` as an empty caption and still displaying the figure, it's causing the entire figure to be omitted from the output.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The system doesn't provide a warning or error message when this happens.
**Cause**: The rendering pipeline lacks proper validation or error handling for edge cases where caption expressions evaluate to zero-length vectors. This makes it difficult for users to debug why their figures are missing.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between non-empty captions and zero-length captions.
**Cause**: The implementation likely assumes captions will always be non-empty strings, and doesn't have proper fallback behavior for edge cases like `character(0)`. This suggests a gap in the specification of how caption handling should work with different types of R expressions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper handling of zero-length character vectors in figure captions, which leads to figures being completely omitted rather than rendered without a caption. This is compounded by a lack of error handling that would alert users to the problem. The inconsistency between how different caption values are handled suggests a need for better specification and implementation of caption handling in the Quarto/knitr rendering pipeline, particularly for edge cases. This issue commonly surfaces when using functions like `sprintf` that can potentially return zero-length character vectors.
