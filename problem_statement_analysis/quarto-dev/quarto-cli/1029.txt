### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The figure on Slide 1 is stretched too much, and the `aside` content overlaps the bottom of the figure.
**Cause**: The `r-stretch` class is likely being applied automatically to the figure, causing it to stretch to fill the available space. This results in the figure overlapping with the `aside` content, which is not given enough priority in the layout.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: On Slide 2, the caption of the figure goes below the `aside` content.
**Cause**: The layout does not properly account for the space needed by the `aside` block when a caption is present. The caption is treated as part of the figure, and the figure's stretching behavior causes it to extend below the `aside` content.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `aside` content does not consistently take the bottom part of the slide when a figure is included.
**Cause**: The CSS rules for the `aside` class do not have sufficient priority or specific positioning to ensure it always occupies the bottom part of the slide. The figure's stretching behavior interferes with the intended layout.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the interaction between the `r-stretch` class and the `aside` class. The `r-stretch` class causes figures to stretch too much, leading to overlap with `aside` content. Additionally, the layout does not properly prioritize the `aside` content, especially when captions are present. To fix these issues, the CSS rules for the `aside` class need to be adjusted to ensure it always takes the bottom part of the slide, and the figure stretching behavior needs to be modified to respect the space occupied by the `aside` content.
