I'll analyze the problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The figure is stretched too much vertically when using both `aside` and `r-stretch` classes
**Cause**: There appears to be a conflict between the automatic `r-stretch` behavior applied to single figures in reveal.js and the `.aside` class positioning. The `r-stretch` tries to fill the available space while not properly accounting for the space needed by the aside content.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The aside content overlaps with the bottom of the figure
**Cause**: The positioning system for the `.aside` class doesn't properly reserve space or adjust the figure container's dimensions. The figure takes up the full slide height while the aside tries to position itself at the bottom, leading to overlap.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Figure captions appear below the aside content instead of staying with their figures
**Cause**: The caption is likely being positioned absolutely or in a way that doesn't maintain its relationship with the figure when the aside content is introduced. This suggests the CSS stacking context or DOM structure isn't properly handling the figure-caption relationship in combination with the aside.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between slides with single figures versus other content layouts
**Cause**: The automatic `r-stretch` behavior only applies to single figures, creating inconsistent spacing and positioning rules when compared to slides with multiple elements or different layouts. This shows that the current implementation doesn't have a unified approach to handling space distribution when asides are present.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues stem from conflicts between reveal.js's automatic figure stretching (`r-stretch`) and the `.aside` class positioning system. The problems manifest in three main ways: excessive figure stretching, content overlap, and caption misplacement. These issues appear to be caused by insufficient space management between components and lack of proper coordination between reveal.js's built-in behaviors and the aside functionality. The solution would likely require implementing a new space management system that gives priority to aside contents and properly adjusts figure dimensions accordingly.
