### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The single Bokeh plot is being incorrectly identified as multiple subfigures (1a, 1b, and 1c), with subfigures 1b and 1c being empty.

**Cause**: The issue likely stems from how the Bokeh plot is being rendered and interpreted by the Quarto document. Bokeh plots are interactive and may not be directly compatible with the static figure handling mechanisms in Quarto. The rendering engine might be misinterpreting the Bokeh output as multiple figures due to the interactive nature or the way the HTML content is structured.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The captions for subfigures 1b and 1c are placeholders ("?(caption)") instead of being empty or correctly formatted.

**Cause**: This could be due to a bug in the Quarto rendering engine where it expects a specific format or structure for figures and subfigures. When it encounters the Bokeh plot, it might be trying to split it into subfigures but fails to correctly assign captions, resulting in placeholder text.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The main figure caption ("This is a demo figure for debug") is only associated with subfigure 1a.

**Cause**: The figure caption is likely being applied only to the first detected figure (1a) because the rendering engine is not correctly handling the single Bokeh plot as a unified figure. This results in the caption being applied only to the first part of the misinterpreted multi-figure structure.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Bokeh plot is not being correctly interpreted as a single figure by the Quarto rendering engine. This misinterpretation leads to the plot being split into multiple subfigures, with incorrect captioning and empty subfigures. The root cause appears to be a compatibility issue between the interactive nature of Bokeh plots and the static figure handling in Quarto. To resolve this, adjustments may be needed in how Bokeh plots are embedded or how Quarto handles such interactive content.
