Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured answer.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Code annotations in VHDL code are not being rendered as circle numbers, instead showing as comments with "<1>" and "<2>" syntax
**Cause**: The code annotation processor appears to handle VHDL comments differently from R and Python, possibly due to different comment syntax (-- in VHDL vs # in R/Python) not being properly recognized by the annotation parser

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Code annotations in C/C++ code are not being rendered as circle numbers, showing as inline comments with "// <1>" and "// <2>" syntax
**Cause**: Similar to VHDL, the annotation processor seems to have issues with C/C++'s comment syntax (//), suggesting the annotation parser may only be optimized for certain comment styles like Python's # or R's #

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual consistency between different programming languages is broken, as R and Python show proper circle numbering while C/C++ and VHDL don't
**Cause**: The annotation system appears to have language-specific implementations rather than a universal comment parsing system, leading to inconsistent behavior across different programming languages

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around inconsistent handling of code annotations across different programming languages. While the annotation system works properly for R and Python (which use # for comments), it fails to properly render annotations for languages using different comment syntaxes like VHDL (--) and C/C++ (//). This suggests a limitation in the annotation parser's ability to recognize and process different comment styles uniformly. The problem appears to be a language-specific implementation issue rather than a general annotation system failure, as evidenced by its correct functioning in some languages but not others.
