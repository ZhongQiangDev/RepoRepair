### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code annotations for C/C++ and VHDL are not being replaced with circle numbering as expected.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the way Quarto handles code annotations for different programming languages. Specifically, the parser or rendering engine used by Quarto may not be correctly configured or implemented to recognize and replace annotations in C/C++ and VHDL code blocks. This could be due to language-specific syntax differences that the current implementation does not account for.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The annotations in the R and Python code blocks are handled correctly, while those in C/C++ and VHDL are not.
**Cause**: The difference in handling could be due to the fact that the Quarto rendering engine has specific configurations or rules for R and Python that are not applied to C/C++ and VHDL. These configurations might include language-specific parsers or rules for recognizing and processing annotations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The comment blocks next to the code are not being properly formatted or replaced with circle numbering.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to how the comment blocks are structured in the code. If the comments are not formatted in a way that the Quarto rendering engine expects, it may not recognize them as annotations and thus not replace them with circle numbering. This could be due to differences in comment syntax or structure between the languages.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The `quarto check` output shows no issues, but the problem still persists.
**Cause**: The `quarto check` command only verifies the basic setup and dependencies of Quarto. It does not check for specific issues related to code annotation handling. Therefore, even if the check passes, there could still be issues with the implementation of code annotation handling for certain languages.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be with the Quarto rendering engine's handling of code annotations for C/C++ and VHDL. The engine may not be correctly configured or implemented to recognize and replace annotations in these languages. This could be due to language-specific syntax differences, lack of specific configurations or rules for these languages, or issues with how the comment blocks are structured. The `quarto check` command does not detect these issues as it only verifies basic setup and dependencies. To resolve this, the Quarto team may need to review and update the code annotation handling for C/C++ and VHDL.
