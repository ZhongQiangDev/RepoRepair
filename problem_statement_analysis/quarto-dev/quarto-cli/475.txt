### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The caption text in the callout block is not processed as markdown, leading to special characters and formatting not being correctly interpreted.
**Cause**: The current implementation uses `pandoc.utils.stringify()` on the caption content, which converts the content to a plain string without processing markdown syntax. This results in special characters and markdown formatting (like bold or code blocks) not being rendered correctly.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Special characters in the caption cause LaTeX errors when rendering to PDF.
**Cause**: The caption text is inserted into the LaTeX block without proper escaping or bracketing. For example, a comma in the caption is interpreted as a new option in the LaTeX block, leading to errors. Additionally, special characters like `%` are not escaped, causing issues in LaTeX.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The caption text is not formatted as expected in the final output (e.g., bold text and code blocks are not rendered).
**Cause**: The caption text is not processed through a markdown renderer. Using `pandoc.utils.stringify()` converts the content to a plain string, ignoring any markdown formatting. This results in the caption text being displayed without any formatting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the lack of markdown processing and improper handling of special characters in the caption text of callout blocks. The current use of `pandoc.utils.stringify()` fails to process markdown syntax, leading to unformatted text and potential LaTeX errors. The proposed changes, such as using `pandoc.write()` for markdown processing and adding brackets around the caption content, address these issues by ensuring proper markdown rendering and escaping of special characters. These changes should resolve the wrong behaviors and improve the overall rendering of callout blocks in both PDF and other formats.
