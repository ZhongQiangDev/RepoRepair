Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Links in index.qmd are not being rendered/displayed when published to Confluence, while they work fine in local preview
**Cause**: This appears to be a link resolution issue specific to the Confluence publishing process. The local Quarto preview can resolve relative paths like `2022-01.qmd` and `2022-03.qmd`, but the Confluence publisher may not be properly converting these relative .qmd file references into the appropriate Confluence page links.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The markdown link syntax is not being processed correctly on Confluence
**Cause**: The Confluence publisher may not be properly handling the standard markdown link syntax `[text](link)` when the links point to .qmd files. This suggests there could be an issue in how the Quarto-to-Confluence converter processes these specific types of internal document references.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The hierarchical document structure that works locally is not maintained in Confluence
**Cause**: The folder structure and document relationships that Quarto understands locally may not be properly mapped to Confluence's page hierarchy system. This could be due to differences in how Confluence handles page relationships compared to Quarto's file-based structure.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a disconnect between Quarto's local file-based navigation system and Confluence's page structure. The main problems center around link resolution, markdown processing, and document hierarchy mapping. The local preview works correctly because it understands the project structure and can resolve relative paths, while the Confluence publisher seems to have limitations in processing these same relationships. This suggests the need for either:
1. Enhanced link processing in the Quarto-to-Confluence publisher
2. A different approach to specifying internal links that's compatible with both systems
3. Better mapping between Quarto's document structure and Confluence's page hierarchy
