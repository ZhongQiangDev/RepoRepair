### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Links are not resolved on Confluence, resulting in plain text instead of clickable links.
**Cause**: The Confluence platform may not support direct linking to `.qmd` files as they are not rendered as HTML or another supported format. Confluence might be expecting a different file type or a specific URL structure that it can interpret as a link.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The local preview shows clickable links, but Confluence does not.
**Cause**: The local preview environment likely renders `.qmd` files into HTML or another web-compatible format, whereas Confluence may not have the same rendering capabilities for `.qmd` files. This discrepancy in rendering capabilities between the local environment and Confluence leads to the links not appearing as expected.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The links work in the local preview but not on Confluence.
**Cause**: There might be a configuration issue or a missing plugin in Confluence that is necessary for interpreting and rendering `.qmd` files correctly. Confluence might require specific settings or additional software to handle Quarto files properly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Confluence does not natively support or correctly render links to `.qmd` files, leading to plain text instead of clickable links. This is likely due to differences in rendering capabilities between the local preview environment and Confluence, as well as potential configuration or plugin requirements in Confluence. To resolve this, Confluence may need additional setup or a different approach to handle Quarto files, such as converting `.qmd` files to a format that Confluence can interpret as links.
