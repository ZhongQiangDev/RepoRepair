### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `panel-tabset` and `nav-fill` combination does not render correctly in Quarto 1.3.146, resulting in the tabs being displayed vertically instead of horizontally and filling the available space.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be related to the order of the classes applied to the tabset. In the original code, the `.panel-tabset` and `.nav-fill` classes are applied together, which may cause a conflict or incorrect rendering in the newer version of Quarto. This could be due to changes in the CSS or JavaScript handling of these classes in the updated version.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tabs are not filling the available horizontal space as expected when using the `nav-fill` class.
**Cause**: The `nav-fill` class is designed to make the tabs fill the available horizontal space. However, when combined with `panel-tabset` in the original code, it does not achieve this effect. This could be because the `panel-tabset` class has its own styling that interferes with the `nav-fill` class. The solution provided, where `nav-fill` is applied to a parent container of `panel-tabset`, suggests that the `nav-fill` class needs to be applied at a higher level in the DOM structure to work correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the incorrect rendering of `panel-tabset` and `nav-fill` in Quarto 1.3.146, which results in the tabs being displayed vertically instead of horizontally filling the available space. This is likely due to a conflict or change in how the classes are handled in the updated version of Quarto. The solution is to apply the `nav-fill` class to a parent container of `panel-tabset`, which allows the `nav-fill` class to work as intended and make the tabs fill the available horizontal space.
