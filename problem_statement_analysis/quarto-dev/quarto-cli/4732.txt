### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The embedded code from `code.R` is not displayed when using the `revealjs` format with the `knitr` engine.
**Cause**: The `knitr` engine might not be properly handling the `embed` chunk option when rendering to `revealjs`. This could be due to a compatibility issue between `knitr` and `revealjs` formats, where the `embed` chunk option is not correctly processed, resulting in an empty code block in the generated HTML.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The generated HTML contains an empty `<div>` block for the embedded code.
**Cause**: The `knitr` engine might not be correctly inserting the content of `code.R` into the HTML output when using the `revealjs` format. This could be due to a bug in the `knitr` engine's handling of the `embed` chunk option in combination with the `revealjs` format, leading to the omission of the actual code content.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The embedded code is displayed correctly when not using the `revealjs` format.
**Cause**: The issue seems to be specific to the `revealjs` format. When not using `revealjs`, the `knitr` engine correctly processes the `embed` chunk option and includes the content of `code.R` in the output. This suggests that the problem lies in the interaction between `knitr` and `revealjs`, rather than a general issue with the `embed` chunk option.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is a compatibility problem between the `knitr` engine and the `revealjs` format when using the `embed` chunk option. The `knitr` engine fails to correctly process and include the embedded code in the HTML output when rendering to `revealjs`, resulting in an empty code block. This issue does not occur when not using the `revealjs` format, indicating that the problem is specific to the interaction between `knitr` and `revealjs`.
