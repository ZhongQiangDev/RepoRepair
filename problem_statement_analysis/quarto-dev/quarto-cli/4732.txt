I'll analyze the problem following the requested format.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The embedded code is not displayed in the revealjs presentation output, showing an empty code block in the HTML.
**Cause**: There appears to be an incompatibility between the knitr embed engine and the revealjs format in Quarto. This is evidenced by the HTML output showing a div with the data-file attribute but no content inside it.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The same code works correctly in regular HTML output but fails specifically in revealjs format.
**Cause**: This suggests that there might be a specific issue in how revealjs processes or handles embedded content from the knitr engine. The problem seems to be isolated to the revealjs format implementation, as the same embedding works fine in standard HTML output.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The generated HTML structure contains empty div elements where the code should be displayed.
**Cause**: The knitr embed engine might not be properly integrated with revealjs's HTML generation process. The presence of the empty div with data-file="code.R" indicates that the system recognizes the file should be embedded but fails to actually insert the content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a compatibility problem between the knitr embed engine and revealjs format in Quarto. While the embedding functionality works correctly in standard HTML output, it fails specifically in revealjs presentations. The problem manifests as empty code blocks in the HTML output, suggesting a breakdown in the pipeline between knitr's embed engine and revealjs's content processing. This could be due to either:
1. A missing handler for embedded content in the revealjs format
2. An incorrect implementation of the embed engine support in revealjs
3. A timing issue where the content is not being processed at the correct stage of the document generation

The issue requires attention to the integration between these two components to ensure proper rendering of embedded content in revealjs presentations.
