Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Hyperlinks on standalone images in RevealJS slides are not being rendered/are non-functional
**Cause**: The RevealJS rendering logic appears to handle standalone images differently from images embedded within text. When an image is alone on a slide, the link wrapper (anchor tag) is likely being stripped or ignored during the HTML conversion process.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between standalone and inline images
**Cause**: The markdown-to-HTML conversion process in Quarto/RevealJS seems to have different parsing rules for:
1. Images that appear alone on a slide
2. Images that are part of a paragraph with other content
This suggests there might be different rendering pathways for these two scenarios in the codebase.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around RevealJS's handling of markdown image links, where the rendering behavior differs based on the image's context. When an image with a link is placed alone on a slide, the link functionality is lost, but the same image retains its link when placed within other content. This points to a potential issue in either:
1. The markdown-to-HTML conversion logic specific to RevealJS
2. The way standalone images are specially handled for presentation formats
3. A possible conflict between RevealJS's image handling and standard markdown link processing

The issue appears to be a bug rather than intended behavior, as there's no logical reason why link functionality should differ based on the image's context within the slide.
