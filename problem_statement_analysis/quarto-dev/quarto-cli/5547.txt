### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The hyperlink on a standalone image in a RevealJS slide is not rendered.
**Cause**: The rendering logic for standalone images in RevealJS may be stripping or ignoring the hyperlink attribute when the image is the only element in the slide. This could be due to a specific rule or bug in the rendering engine that treats standalone images differently from images that are part of a larger block of content.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The hyperlink works when the image is accompanied by other text content on the slide.
**Cause**: When the image is not standalone and is part of a block of content, the rendering engine processes the hyperlink correctly. This suggests that the issue is specifically related to how standalone images are handled, rather than a general problem with hyperlink rendering.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is specific to the version of Quarto being used (1.3.185).
**Cause**: The version of Quarto might have a bug or a specific implementation detail that affects how standalone images with hyperlinks are rendered. Upgrading to a newer version of Quarto or checking for any updates or patches related to this issue could potentially resolve the problem.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that hyperlinks on standalone images in RevealJS slides are not rendered correctly, likely due to a specific rule or bug in the rendering logic for standalone images. This problem does not occur when the image is part of a larger block of content. The issue appears to be version-specific to Quarto 1.3.185, suggesting that an update or patch might be necessary to resolve the problem.
