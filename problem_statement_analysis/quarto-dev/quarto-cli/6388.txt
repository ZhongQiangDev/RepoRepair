### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The markdown list is not correctly formatted as sub-bullets are introduced.
**Cause**: The `pander` package is generating markdown with nested bullet points, which is not the intended format. This is likely due to how `pander` handles lists internally, introducing additional levels of nesting that are not desired in this context.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The intermediary markdown file is messed up with incorrect formatting.
**Cause**: The processing step that converts the R code chunk output to markdown is not correctly handling the output from `pander`. This could be due to a mismatch in how `pander` formats its output and how the markdown processor expects the input. Specifically, the additional indentation and nesting of bullet points are not being properly flattened.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The knitted result with `knitr::knit("test.qmd")` gives the correct formatting, but the initial output does not.
**Cause**: The `knitr` package might be applying additional processing or transformations to the output that corrects the formatting issues introduced by `pander`. This suggests that the issue lies in the interaction between `pander` and the markdown processor used in the initial output, rather than in `knitr` itself.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `pander` package is generating markdown with nested bullet points, which is not the intended format. This is likely due to how `pander` handles lists internally. The intermediary markdown file is messed up because the processing step that converts the R code chunk output to markdown is not correctly handling the output from `pander`. The `knitr` package might be applying additional processing or transformations to the output that corrects the formatting issues introduced by `pander`. To resolve this, one could either modify the `pander` output to avoid nested bullet points or adjust the markdown processor to handle the `pander` output correctly.
