### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Lua filter errors out when a theorem or proof block contains a code block without a header/label.
**Cause**: The Lua filter (`crossref.lua`) expects a specific structure for theorem and proof blocks. When a code block is included without a header/label, the Lua filter encounters a `nil` value where it expects a table, leading to the error. This is likely due to the filter not being able to properly parse or handle the structure of the block when it lacks the expected header/label.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The theorem caption is included as part of the list in the theorem body when using (un-)ordered lists inside a theorem div.
**Cause**: The Markdown parser is not correctly distinguishing between the theorem caption and the list items. When a list is used immediately after the theorem caption, the parser may interpret the caption as the first item in the list, leading to the unexpected inclusion of the caption in the list. This could be due to a lack of proper separation between the caption and the list in the Markdown syntax.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: 
- The Lua filter error occurs because the filter expects a specific structure for theorem and proof blocks, and it fails when a code block is included without a header/label.
- The unexpected inclusion of the theorem caption in the list is due to the Markdown parser not correctly distinguishing between the caption and the list items, likely because of insufficient separation in the syntax.
To resolve these issues, the Lua filter should be updated to handle blocks without headers/labels more gracefully, and the Markdown syntax for theorems and proofs should be adjusted to ensure proper separation between captions and list items.
