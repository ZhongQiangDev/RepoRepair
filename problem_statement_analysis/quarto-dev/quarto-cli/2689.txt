### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `crossref: false` setting is not being respected in the HTML format.
**Cause**: The `testcrossref.lua` filter might be overriding the `crossref: false` setting. Filters can modify the document structure and may not be aware of or respect the `crossref` setting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `crossref: false` setting is not being properly applied to the HTML output.
**Cause**: There might be a bug or missing implementation in the code that processes the `crossref` setting. The code responsible for handling the `crossref` setting might not be correctly configured to disable cross-references when `crossref: false` is specified.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `crossref: false` setting is not affecting the output as expected.
**Cause**: The configuration file might not be correctly parsed or applied. There could be an issue with how the YAML configuration is being read and applied to the document generation process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to the `testcrossref.lua` filter potentially overriding the `crossref: false` setting, a possible bug in the code that handles the `crossref` setting, and potential problems with the configuration file parsing. Addressing these causes should help ensure that the `crossref: false` setting is respected in the HTML output.
