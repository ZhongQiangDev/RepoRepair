Let me analyze the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate content/images appearing in the document
**Cause**: The system is not respecting or implementing the `crossref: false` configuration option, causing cross-references or content to be repeated multiple times in the output

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Formatting control limitation
**Cause**: The formats system appears to lack proper support for controlling cross-reference behavior through the `crossref` parameter, which should allow users to disable cross-referencing when needed

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the lack of support for the `crossref: false` option in formats, resulting in unwanted content duplication. The problem manifests in two key ways:
1. Content/images being duplicated due to uncontrolled cross-referencing
2. Inability to properly control cross-reference behavior through format settings

To fix this, the system needs to implement proper support for the `crossref: false` parameter in formats to give users control over cross-referencing behavior and prevent unwanted content duplication.

Note: Since the provided image appears to be duplicated in the problem description itself, I'm assuming the issue is about preventing such duplication through proper cross-reference control, though without more context about the specific system and its intended behavior, some assumptions had to be made.
