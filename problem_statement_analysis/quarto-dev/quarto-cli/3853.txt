### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Excessive vertical space before definition/theorem/etc environments in LaTeX output.
**Cause**: The `\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{def-def}{}}` command is prepended to each definition (and similar) environment. This command is adding unwanted vertical space before the environment. Removing this command resolves the issue.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The QED symbol (white box) is placed below its normal position in the proof environment.
**Cause**: An extra empty line between the end of the proof text and the `\end{proof}` tag is causing the QED symbol to be placed lower than expected. Removing this empty line aligns the QED symbol with the expected position.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: 
1. The excessive vertical space before definition/theorem/etc environments is caused by the `\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{def-def}{}}` command, which adds unwanted vertical space. This can be fixed by removing this command from the generated LaTeX code.
2. The misalignment of the QED symbol in the proof environment is due to an extra empty line before the `\end{proof}` tag. Removing this empty line corrects the placement of the QED symbol. 

Both issues stem from the way Quarto generates the LaTeX code, and addressing these specific parts of the generated code should resolve the observed problems.
