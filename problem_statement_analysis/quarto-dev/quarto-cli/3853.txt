I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub issue description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Excessive vertical space appears before definition/theorem/etc environments in the LaTeX output
**Cause**: The insertion of `\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{def-def}{}}` code before each environment. This code is automatically added by Quarto for hyperlink functionality but creates unwanted spacing as a side effect.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The QED symbol (white box) in proofs appears lower than its normal position
**Cause**: Extra empty line in the generated LaTeX code between the proof text and the `\end{proof}` command. Specifically:
1. Quarto generates:
```latex
\begin{proof}
[proof text]

\end{proof}
```
2. Instead of the correct format:
```latex
\begin{proof}
[proof text]
\end{proof}
```

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue presents two main problems in the LaTeX output:
1. Vertical spacing issues before environments caused by automatically inserted hyperlink-related code
2. Misplaced QED symbols due to extra line breaks in proof environments

Both issues appear to be related to how Quarto generates the LaTeX code, with the first being a side effect of adding accessibility features (hyperlinks) and the second being a formatting issue in the code generation process. These problems are consistent across different LaTeX document classes and affect the visual presentation of mathematical content in the PDF output.
