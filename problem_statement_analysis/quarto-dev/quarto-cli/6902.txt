### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In the first minimal working example, the subfigures are labeled as normal figures (Figure 1 and Figure 2), instead of being labeled as subfigures (e.g., (a) and (b)).

**Cause**: The LaTeX code generated by Quarto does not include the `\subcaption` package and the `\subcaption` command. Instead, it uses the `\caption` command within each `minipage`, which results in each subfigure being treated as a separate figure.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The first minimal working example does not produce the expected subfigure labels (e.g., (a) and (b)).

**Cause**: The absence of explicit cross-reference information (`{#fig-surus}` and `{#fig-hanno}`) in the first example means that Quarto does not recognize the need to generate subfigure labels. Without these labels, Quarto defaults to treating each image as a standalone figure.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The second minimal working example, which includes cross-reference information, correctly labels the subfigures as (a) and (b).

**Cause**: The inclusion of cross-reference information (`{#fig-surus}` and `{#fig-hanno}`) prompts Quarto to generate the appropriate LaTeX code using the `\subcaption` command. This results in the correct labeling of subfigures within the main figure.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Quarto does not automatically generate subfigure labels without explicit cross-reference information. This is because the `\subcaption` package and command are not included in the LaTeX output unless subfigure labels are explicitly requested. To avoid this issue, users should include cross-reference information for subfigures, which will prompt Quarto to generate the correct LaTeX code for subfigure labeling.
