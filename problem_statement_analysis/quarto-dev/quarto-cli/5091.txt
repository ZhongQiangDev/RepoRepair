### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The image URL is not being rendered correctly in the PDF output.
**Cause**: The URL contains special characters and is not properly encoded. The URL includes characters like `%3A` and `%2F`, which are URL-encoded representations of `:` and `/`. However, the PDF rendering engine might not handle these encoded characters correctly, leading to the error `Unable to load picture or PDF file 'badurl_files/mediabag/https://bucket.jpeg'`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message indicates that the URL is being interpreted incorrectly.
**Cause**: The PDF rendering engine (XeTeX in this case) is trying to interpret the URL as a local file path rather than a remote URL. This is evident from the error message `Unable to load picture or PDF file 'badurl_files/mediabag/https://bucket.jpeg'`, where it seems to be treating the URL as a local file path.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The image fails to load, causing the PDF compilation to fail.
**Cause**: The PDF rendering engine does not support fetching images from remote URLs directly. It expects the images to be local files or properly handled through a mechanism that can download and embed the images in the PDF.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the PDF rendering engine (XeTeX) does not handle URL-encoded characters and remote URLs correctly. The URL is being misinterpreted as a local file path, leading to a failure in loading the image and subsequently causing the PDF compilation to fail. To resolve this, the image should be downloaded locally and referenced as a local file, or the URL should be properly handled by the rendering engine to fetch and embed the image directly.
