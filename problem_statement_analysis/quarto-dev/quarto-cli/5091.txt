Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: PDF rendering fails when using a complex/nonstandard image URL from Substack CDN
**Cause**: The URL contains special characters and multiple URL components (nested URLs) that XeTeX cannot properly handle when processing the image path. The error message shows that the system is trying to interpret the complex URL as a local file path ("badurl_files/mediabag/https://bucket.jpeg"), which is incorrect.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Image path handling in XeTeX is not properly managing URL encoding
**Cause**: The URL contains encoded characters (%3A, %2F) and multiple forward slashes that are confusing XeTeX's file path parser. XeTeX is treating the URL as a local file path instead of recognizing it as a remote URL that needs to be downloaded.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Media resource management system isn't properly downloading/caching the remote image
**Cause**: Quarto's media handling system appears to be failing to properly download and store the remote image in the local mediabag directory, which is necessary for PDF compilation. This is evidenced by the system looking for the file in a local "mediabag" directory instead of using a properly downloaded local copy.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from trying to use a complex, nested CDN URL in a PDF document. The problems cascade from:
1. URL complexity and encoding issues
2. XeTeX's limitation in handling remote URLs directly
3. Failure in Quarto's media resource management system to properly download and reference the image locally

The solution would likely involve either simplifying the image URL, implementing better URL handling in the PDF generation process, or improving the media resource management system to better handle complex URLs.
