### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The title slide elements (title, subtitle, author, institute, and date) are not centered when using `hash-type: number`.
**Cause**: The CSS or layout configuration associated with `hash-type: number` might not be properly aligning the elements. This could be due to a missing or incorrect CSS rule that centers the content on the title slide when `hash-type: number` is specified.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The date appears on the left side of the slide instead of being centered when using `hash-type: number`.
**Cause**: The specific CSS rule that centers the date on the title slide might be overridden or not applied when `hash-type: number` is used. This could be due to a conflict or missing rule in the CSS that handles the date alignment.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The subtitle and author/institute text are not aligned properly when using `hash-type: number`.
**Cause**: The layout or CSS rules that handle the alignment of subtitle and author/institute text might be different or missing when `hash-type: number` is specified. This could be due to a different CSS class or selector being applied that does not include the necessary alignment properties.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the CSS or layout configuration for `hash-type: number` is not correctly centering the title slide elements. This results in the title, subtitle, author, institute, and date being misaligned. The specific causes include missing or incorrect CSS rules for centering the content, date, subtitle, and author/institute text. Adjusting the CSS rules or layout configuration for `hash-type: number` should resolve the alignment issues.
