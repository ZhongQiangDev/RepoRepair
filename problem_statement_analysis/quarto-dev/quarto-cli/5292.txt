Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Code annotations in PDF output are not displaying correctly because the `tikz` package is not included
**Cause**: The LaTeX `tikz` package, which is required for creating circular annotations in PDF output, is not being automatically included in the Quarto PDF generation process in version 1.3.336

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `\circled` command is undefined in the PDF output
**Cause**: The LaTeX command `\circled` used for creating circular annotations is not being defined in the default LaTeX template or preamble in this Quarto version

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Even when manually defining the `\circled` command in the preamble, the stylized list elements below the code blocks are not properly formatted
**Cause**: There appears to be an inconsistency in how the annotation styling is applied between the code blocks and their corresponding explanation lists, suggesting a potential issue with the PDF rendering pipeline for code annotations

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around PDF code annotation functionality being broken in Quarto version 1.3.336. This manifests in three related problems: missing `tikz` package inclusion, undefined `\circled` command, and inconsistent annotation styling between code blocks and explanation lists. These issues appear to be related to how Quarto handles LaTeX dependencies and commands for PDF output generation, specifically in the context of code annotations. The problem seems to be a regression in version 1.3.336 as it's reported as a new issue with the "latest version."
