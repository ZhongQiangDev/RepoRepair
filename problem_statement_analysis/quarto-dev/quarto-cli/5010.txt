### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Images display correctly inline within the blog post but do not appear in the grid view.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from how the grid view handles URLs with non-standard characters (such as commas and other punctuation). The grid view may not properly escape or encode these characters, leading to broken image previews.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The image URL `![](diet-assets/clabberedMilk.jpg)` works inline but fails in the grid view.
**Cause**: The relative path `diet-assets/clabberedMilk.jpg` might not be correctly resolved in the grid view context. The grid view might expect absolute paths or a different base URL for assets, causing the image to not be found.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The image URL `http://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57bf31396a6acdf3485df7f9/5:4/w_1028,c_limit/koji-steak-1.jpg` works inline but fails in the grid view.
**Cause**: The URL contains non-standard characters like commas and colons, which might not be properly handled by the grid view's URL parsing or rendering mechanism. This could lead to the URL being misinterpreted or truncated.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary causes of the issue are the grid view's inability to handle non-standard characters in URLs and potential issues with resolving relative paths. The inline display works because it is processed in a different context that correctly handles these URLs. To resolve the issue, the grid view's URL handling and asset path resolution mechanisms need to be improved to accommodate non-standard characters and relative paths. Additionally, ensuring that the grid view properly encodes and decodes URLs could help in displaying images correctly.
