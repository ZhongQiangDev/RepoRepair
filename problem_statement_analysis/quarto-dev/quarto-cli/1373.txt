Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The code-tools menu doesn't appear when using a URL in the `source` parameter
**Cause**: The code-tools feature appears to not properly handle external URL sources, while it works correctly when set to `source: true`. This suggests there may be an implementation limitation or bug in how Quarto processes external URLs for the code-tools functionality.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The feature works inconsistently between different source configurations
**Cause**: There seems to be a disconnect in how the code-tools implementation handles different types of source specifications. While it can handle boolean values (`source: true`), it fails to properly process URL strings, indicating a potential gap in the feature's source handling logic.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the code-tools feature's inability to properly handle URL sources in Quarto documents. While the feature works as expected with boolean configuration (`source: true`), it fails when provided with an external URL source. This suggests a limitation or bug in the code-tools implementation specifically related to URL handling. The problem appears to be consistent across the user's environment (macOS 12.4, Quarto 1.0.16, RStudio 2022.07.0+548), indicating it's likely a core issue with the feature rather than an environment-specific problem.

The fix would likely require updating the code-tools implementation to properly handle URL sources, ensuring it can process both boolean and URL string configurations consistently.
