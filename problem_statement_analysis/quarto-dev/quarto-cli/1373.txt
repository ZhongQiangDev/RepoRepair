### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `code-tools` menu does not show up when using a URL for the `source` parameter.
**Cause**: The URL provided (`https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/index.md`) points to a GitHub web page rather than a raw file. The `code-tools` feature likely expects a direct link to the raw content of the file, not the rendered GitHub page. This mismatch in URL format prevents the `code-tools` from correctly identifying and processing the source file.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `code-tools` menu works correctly when `source: true` is used.
**Cause**: When `source: true` is specified, the `code-tools` feature uses the local file as the source. This works because the local file is directly accessible and correctly formatted for the `code-tools` to process. In contrast, the URL provided in the first scenario points to a web page, which is not in the expected format.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `code-tools` menu does not appear even though the URL is valid and points to the correct file.
**Cause**: The URL format for GitHub files should be adjusted to point to the raw content of the file. For example, the correct URL should be something like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/main/index.md` instead of the web page URL. This ensures that the `code-tools` can directly access and process the file content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `code-tools` feature expects a direct link to the raw content of the file, not the rendered GitHub page. Using `source: true` works because it uses the local file, which is correctly formatted. To fix the issue with the URL, the URL should be adjusted to point to the raw content of the file on GitHub. This ensures that the `code-tools` can correctly identify and process the source file.
