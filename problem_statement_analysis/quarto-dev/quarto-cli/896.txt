### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In Test A and Test C, the image is not placed inside the custom div as expected but is bumped outside the div.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from how the `.qrcodeblock` and `.anotherblocks` classes are defined or interpreted in the reveal.js format. The custom divs may not be properly styled or recognized to contain images, causing the image to fall outside the div.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The image placement works correctly only in the columns layout (Test B).
**Cause**: The `.columns` class in reveal.js is specifically designed to handle content layout in a way that ensures proper placement of images within the defined columns. This class may have built-in styles or properties that correctly manage the flow of text and images, which are not present in the custom divs used in Test A and Test C.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The image appears after the text "Why not?" in Test A and Test C.
**Cause**: The default behavior of the reveal.js format might be causing the image to be treated as a block-level element that cannot be contained within the custom div unless explicitly styled. Without specific CSS rules to control the image's placement, it defaults to appearing after the text.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the improper placement of images within custom divs in reveal.js. This is caused by the lack of specific styling for the custom divs and the inherent behavior of reveal.js in handling images. The `.columns` class works correctly because it is specifically designed to manage content layout, including images. To fix this, custom CSS rules should be applied to the custom divs to ensure images are properly contained within them.
