### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The table spanner "Subheader" is not correctly spanning the columns `x` and `y`. Instead, it appears to span the entire table width, which is not the desired behavior.
**Cause**: This issue might be due to a CSS styling problem where the spanner's width is not being correctly calculated or applied. The spanner's width might be set to 100% or another value that causes it to span the entire table width instead of just the specified columns.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The table caption "Caption" is not appearing above the table as expected.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to how the caption is being processed or rendered in the presence of the spanner. The caption might be getting overridden or misplaced due to the spanner's styling or positioning.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The table layout and alignment are not as expected. The columns `x` and `y` under the "Subheader" spanner are not properly aligned, and the table appears stretched.
**Cause**: This could be due to a combination of CSS and table processing issues. The spanner might be affecting the column widths and alignment, causing the table to stretch and the columns to misalign.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the table spanner's width and positioning, the caption's rendering, and the overall table layout and alignment. These issues are likely caused by CSS styling problems and table processing issues when the spanner and caption are present. Addressing these causes should help achieve the desired table output.
