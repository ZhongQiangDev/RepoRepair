Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The table width is significantly larger than necessary, spanning almost the entire width of the container (1153px vs desired 545px)
**Cause**: This appears to be a CSS styling issue where the gt table is not respecting its natural content width when combined with Quarto captions. The table is likely being forced to expand to fill the container width.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Extra empty space appears on both sides of the table content
**Cause**: The table's container width is not properly constrained when table spanners are used in combination with Quarto captions. The spanner header "Subheader" may be affecting how the table width is calculated.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The table's proportions appear distorted compared to the desired output
**Cause**: The interaction between gt's table spanners and Quarto's caption handling is likely causing conflicts in how the table dimensions are computed. The table layout algorithm may be prioritizing container width over content width when both spanners and captions are present.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a compatibility problem between gt table spanners and Quarto captions. This manifests in three main ways: excessive table width, unnecessary empty space, and distorted proportions. The root cause seems to be related to how CSS handles the table width calculations when both spanners and captions are present. This could be either a CSS specificity issue or a conflict in how gt and Quarto process table layouts. A fix would likely involve adjusting either the CSS rules for tables with captions or modifying how gt handles table sizing when used within Quarto documents with captions.
