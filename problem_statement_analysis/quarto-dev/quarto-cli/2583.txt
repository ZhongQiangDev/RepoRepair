### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Markdown styling (such as italics and superscript) is not applied in table captions.
**Cause**: The table caption is placed inside a `div` element that does not interpret Markdown syntax. This is evident from the `.md` file excerpt where the caption is directly inserted as plain text without being processed for Markdown formatting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue does not occur with figure captions, indicating a discrepancy in how captions are handled for tables versus figures.
**Cause**: The handling of captions for tables and figures is likely implemented differently in the Quarto rendering process. For figures, the caption is processed through a mechanism that supports Markdown, whereas for tables, the caption is inserted as plain text without Markdown interpretation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The intermediate `.md` file shows the table caption as plain text without any Markdown formatting.
**Cause**: The Quarto rendering engine is not correctly processing the `!expr` directive for table captions, leading to the raw text being inserted instead of being interpreted as Markdown. This suggests a bug in the way Quarto handles table captions specifically.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that table captions in Quarto do not support Markdown styling due to how they are processed and inserted into the document. The captions are treated as plain text, bypassing any Markdown interpretation. This behavior is specific to table captions and does not affect figure captions, indicating a difference in the implementation of caption handling for these elements. The root cause appears to be a bug in the Quarto rendering engine related to the processing of table captions.
