I'll analyze the GitHub issue following the requested format:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Markdown styling (like _italics_ and ^superscript^) doesn't work in table captions while it works fine in figure captions
**Cause**: Table captions are being wrapped in a div element that ignores Markdown syntax, as shown in the .md file excerpt where the caption is enclosed in `:::` div blocks. This special handling of table captions differs from how figure captions are processed.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The same styling limitations appear when rendering to PDF format
**Cause**: The issue persists across output formats because it's related to how Quarto fundamentally processes table captions at the structural level, not just in HTML rendering. The table caption formatting is being stripped or ignored before it reaches the final rendering stage.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `!expr` syntax for dynamic captions maintains the raw text without processing Markdown
**Cause**: The expression evaluation system (`!expr`) appears to be treating the caption text as plain text rather than Markdown content that needs to be processed, even though the caption is being properly evaluated from the R variable.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Quarto's differential treatment of table and figure captions in its processing pipeline. While figure captions properly process Markdown syntax, table captions are wrapped in special div elements that prevent Markdown processing. This affects both HTML and PDF outputs, and persists even when using dynamic captions through the `!expr` syntax. The problem appears to be structural in how Quarto handles table caption formatting rather than a rendering or syntax issue.
