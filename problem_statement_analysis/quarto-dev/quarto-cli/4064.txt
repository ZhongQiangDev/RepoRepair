### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The presentation does not appear at all when using percentage values for `width` and `height` in the YAML configuration.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the percentage values for `width` and `height` are not being properly interpreted by the reveal.js framework. The framework expects these values to be in pixels, and when percentages are used, it may not correctly calculate the dimensions, leading to a blank screen.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The presentation displays correctly when using pixel values for `width` and `height`.
**Cause**: When pixel values are used, the reveal.js framework can accurately interpret and apply the dimensions to the presentation canvas. This results in the presentation being displayed as expected, with the correct layout and content.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The documentation suggests that percentage values should work for `width` and `height`, but they do not.
**Cause**: There may be a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation of reveal.js in the Quarto CLI. The documentation might not have been updated to reflect changes in the framework's behavior, or there could be a bug in the implementation that prevents percentage values from being processed correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that percentage values for `width` and `height` are not being correctly interpreted by the reveal.js framework, leading to a blank screen. This is likely due to a discrepancy between the expected behavior (as documented) and the actual implementation. Using pixel values instead of percentages resolves the issue, as the framework can accurately interpret and apply these dimensions. To address this, the documentation should be reviewed and updated if necessary, and any bugs in the implementation should be investigated and fixed.
