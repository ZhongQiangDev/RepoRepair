### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Markdown parser requires the use of a backslash (`\`) before a parenthesis `(` to properly render the text.
**Cause**: The Markdown parser is interpreting the parentheses `(` and `)` as part of a link or other formatting syntax. By default, Markdown uses parentheses to denote links, so when it encounters them in plain text, it tries to parse them as part of a link structure. Adding a backslash (`\`) before the parenthesis escapes it, telling the parser to treat it as a literal character rather than part of a formatting command.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The original text in the sample file is not being rendered correctly without the backslash before the parentheses.
**Cause**: The Markdown parser is not configured to handle parentheses within plain text without escaping. This is a limitation or design choice of the specific Markdown parser being used (in this case, `marked.js`). The parser is strictly following its rules for interpreting Markdown syntax, which leads to the need for escaping characters that have special meaning in Markdown.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Markdown parser is interpreting parentheses `(` and `)` as part of its syntax for links or other formatting, rather than as plain text. This behavior is a result of the parser's design and rules for interpreting Markdown. To fix this, users must escape the parentheses with a backslash (`\`) to ensure they are treated as literal characters. This limitation highlights the need for users to be aware of the specific syntax rules of the Markdown parser they are using and to properly escape characters when necessary.
