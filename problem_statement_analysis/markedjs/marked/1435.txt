Let me analyze the GitHub issue based on the provided information.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The markdown parser requires an escape character ('\') before parentheses '(' in regular text, which should not be necessary according to standard markdown syntax.
**Cause**: The markdown parser (marked) is likely treating regular parentheses as potential syntax for markdown links, causing it to require escape characters to display literal parentheses. This suggests an overly aggressive parsing rule for link detection.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Text content that contains parentheses is not being rendered correctly without escape characters
**Cause**: The parser's tokenization process is not properly distinguishing between markdown link syntax `[text](url)` and regular text that happens to contain parentheses. This indicates a potential issue with the context-awareness of the parser.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the markdown parser's handling of parentheses characters, where it's incorrectly requiring escape characters for regular text. This behavior violates standard markdown syntax expectations where parentheses in regular text should not need escaping. The parser needs to be updated to:
1. Better distinguish between link syntax and regular text
2. Only require escape characters for parentheses when they're actually part of markdown syntax
3. Allow unescaped parentheses in regular text contexts

The fix would likely involve adjusting the parser's tokenization rules to be more context-aware when processing parentheses characters.
