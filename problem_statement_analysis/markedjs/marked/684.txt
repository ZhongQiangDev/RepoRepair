Let me analyze the GitHub markdown rendering issue:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When unordered list (-) is immediately followed by ordered list (1,2,3) without spacing, the ordered list numbers are rendered incorrectly as a continuation of the unordered list
**Cause**: Markdown parsers treat consecutive lists without separation as a single list context, causing the ordered list to be interpreted as a continuation of the unordered list rather than a new list

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Adding just one blank line between the lists still produces incorrect rendering
**Cause**: Most Markdown implementations require a full paragraph break (two newlines) to properly separate distinct list contexts. A single newline is treated as a line break within the same list context rather than a list separator

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Only adding two blank lines between lists produces correct rendering
**Cause**: This is actually expected behavior per CommonMark spec, which requires lists to be separated by blank lines to be treated as separate list blocks. The two blank lines create a proper paragraph break that allows the parser to recognize these as independent lists

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from how Markdown parsers handle list contexts and separations. Without proper paragraph breaks (two blank lines), consecutive lists are treated as part of the same list context, leading to unexpected rendering. While this behavior may seem unintuitive, it's actually part of the CommonMark specification for Markdown. The solution is to ensure proper list separation using paragraph breaks (two blank lines) when switching between different list types. This maintains clear distinction between independent list blocks and ensures correct rendering.
