### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The first example renders all items as part of a single unordered list, even though the last three items are intended to be part of an ordered list.
**Cause**: In Markdown, when there is no blank line between two different types of lists (unordered and ordered), the parser treats them as a single list. This is because the Markdown parser follows a rule that consecutive list items, regardless of their type, are considered part of the same list unless separated by a blank line.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The second example renders the first three items as an unordered list and the last three items as a nested ordered list under the last unordered item.
**Cause**: In this case, there is a single blank line between the unordered and ordered lists. This single blank line is not enough for the Markdown parser to recognize the start of a new list. Instead, it interprets the ordered list as a continuation of the unordered list, but as a nested list under the last unordered item.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue here is the lack of a clear specification in Markdown regarding the separation of different types of lists. The parser's behavior is based on the presence of blank lines. Two blank lines are required to ensure that the parser recognizes the start of a new list. This behavior is not explicitly mentioned in many Markdown guides, which can lead to confusion. To avoid such issues, it is recommended to use two blank lines between different types of lists to ensure they are rendered correctly.
