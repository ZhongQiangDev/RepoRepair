Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The strikethrough syntax with double tildes `~~12345~~` renders correctly, but the incomplete strikethrough syntax `~~67890~` and single tilde `~13579~` are not rendering as expected.
**Cause**: The Markdown parser is not properly handling unclosed strikethrough syntax (missing closing tildes) and single tilde cases. The parser should either:
1. Show an error for incomplete syntax
2. Render the text as-is without strikethrough
3. Auto-close the strikethrough formatting

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The single tilde syntax `~13579~` is being treated as plain text instead of any formatting
**Cause**: This is actually expected behavior since the standard Markdown strikethrough syntax requires double tildes (~~). Single tildes are not part of the strikethrough specification in GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The unclosed strikethrough `~~67890~` shows the tilde characters in the output instead of either completing the strikethrough or showing an error
**Cause**: The Marked parser lacks proper error handling or recovery mechanisms for malformed strikethrough syntax. When it encounters an opening strikethrough (~~) without a closing one, it should either:
- Complete the strikethrough to the end of the line
- Show a parsing error
- Escape the tildes and show them as literal characters in a consistent way

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around how the Marked parser handles strikethrough syntax edge cases. While it correctly processes properly formed strikethrough text (~~text~~), it has inconsistent behavior with:
1. Unclosed strikethrough sequences
2. Single tilde usage
3. Error handling for malformed syntax

The parser needs more robust handling of these edge cases to either properly format the text, show clear errors, or consistently escape the special characters when the syntax is incorrect.
