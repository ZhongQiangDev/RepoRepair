### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The table columns are not properly aligned, and the "可选值" and "默认值" columns are merged into a single column.
**Cause**: The markdown table syntax used in the description does not properly separate the columns. The `|` characters are not correctly placed to define the boundaries of each column, leading to misalignment and merging of columns.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The table header row is not correctly formatted, causing the header text to be misaligned with the corresponding data rows.
**Cause**: The header row in the markdown table does not have the correct number of `|` characters to define the boundaries of each column. This results in the header text being misaligned with the data rows below it.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The "默认值" column is not properly displayed, and the content is missing.
**Cause**: The markdown table syntax does not include the correct content for the "默认值" column in the data rows. The `|` characters are not correctly placed to define the boundaries of each column, leading to the content being omitted or merged into other columns.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues with the table rendering are due to incorrect markdown syntax. The `|` characters are not properly placed to define the boundaries of each column, leading to misalignment, merging of columns, and missing content. To fix these issues, the markdown table syntax should be corrected to ensure that each column is properly defined and separated. This will result in a properly aligned and formatted table with all columns and content displayed correctly.
