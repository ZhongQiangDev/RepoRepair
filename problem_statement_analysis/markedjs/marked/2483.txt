### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The fenced code block that follows a list item is not properly recognized when it contains blank lines. Instead of being treated as a single code block, the blank lines cause the content to be split into separate elements, disrupting the expected HTML output.

**Cause**: The issue arises from how the Markdown parser handles blank lines within fenced code blocks that follow list items. Specifically, the parser may be interpreting the blank line as the end of the list item and the start of a new paragraph, rather than as part of the code block. This behavior is likely due to the parser's rules for list item continuation and code block recognition not being aligned in this specific scenario.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: When there are no blank lines within the fenced code block following a list item, the code block is correctly recognized and formatted as expected.

**Cause**: In the absence of blank lines, the Markdown parser can correctly identify the entire fenced code block as a single unit following the list item. This is because the parser's rules for recognizing code blocks are more straightforward when there are no interruptions (such as blank lines) within the block. The parser can then correctly wrap the entire block in the appropriate HTML tags (`<pre>` and `<code>`) within the list item (`<li>`).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is with the parser's handling of blank lines within fenced code blocks that follow list items. When blank lines are present, the parser incorrectly interprets them as the end of the list item and the start of new content, leading to a disrupted HTML output. In contrast, when there are no blank lines, the parser correctly identifies and formats the code block as expected. To resolve this, the parser's rules for recognizing code blocks within list items need to be adjusted to properly handle blank lines, ensuring that the entire code block is treated as a single unit.
