Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the problems and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The fenced code block with blank lines is not being properly rendered when it follows a list item
**Cause**: The Markdown parser (marked.js) appears to be incorrectly handling the indentation rules for fenced code blocks within list items when blank lines are present. It's treating the blank line as a break in the list context, causing the code block to be parsed outside of the list item.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The HTML output structure is incorrect when blank lines exist in the code block
**Cause**: The parser is not maintaining the proper nesting level for the code block content when it encounters blank lines. Instead of preserving the code block as a single unit within the list item, it's breaking the structure at the blank line.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between code blocks with and without blank lines
**Cause**: The parser's logic for handling code block continuations is not properly accounting for blank lines while maintaining the list context. This creates an inconsistency where code blocks without blank lines work correctly, but those with blank lines fail.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from marked.js's handling of fenced code blocks within list contexts, specifically when blank lines are present. The parser needs to:
1. Maintain list context regardless of blank lines in code blocks
2. Properly handle indentation rules for nested code blocks
3. Ensure consistent behavior between code blocks with and without blank lines
4. Generate correct HTML structure that keeps the entire code block (including blank lines) within the list item

The issue appears to be a parser-level problem that requires fixing the tokenization and parsing rules for nested fenced code blocks within list items.
