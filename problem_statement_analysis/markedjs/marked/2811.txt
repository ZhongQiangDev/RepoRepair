I'll analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Markdown syntax fails to parse correctly when Japanese punctuation (、) is combined with strong syntax (**) and code syntax (`) without spaces
**Cause**: The Marked parser seems to have issues with character boundary detection when CJK punctuation marks are directly adjacent to Markdown syntax elements. This appears to be a limitation in how the parser handles non-ASCII characters in combination with multiple markup elements.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Strong syntax works inconsistently when code syntax is involved with Japanese text
**Cause**: The parser treats the combination of strong and code syntax differently when they're adjacent to CJK characters versus when they're adjacent to ASCII characters. This suggests the parser's rules for handling nested syntax elements don't properly account for Unicode character boundaries.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Strong syntax fails to parse correctly when containing links followed by certain characters
**Cause**: The parser has specific rules about what characters can follow a strong delimiter (**) when it contains a link. It works correctly with ASCII punctuation (.!,;) and spaces, but fails with:
- CJK punctuation (！)
- Regular characters immediately following (M)
This suggests the parser's rules for ending strong syntax are too restrictive and don't properly handle all valid use cases.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between older and newer versions of Marked
**Cause**: Changes in the parsing rules between versions (particularly noted between v0.2.9 and newer versions) have introduced these issues, suggesting that modifications to the parser's handling of nested elements and character boundaries have inadvertently created new edge cases.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issues revolve around Marked's parser having difficulties with:
1. Character boundary detection for non-ASCII characters
2. Handling nested syntax elements (particularly strong + code or strong + link combinations)
3. Overly restrictive rules for what can follow certain syntax elements
4. Regression in handling these cases compared to older versions

The problems appear to be primarily related to how the parser handles character boundaries and combinations of multiple syntax elements, particularly when dealing with non-ASCII text and nested markup structures. These issues seem more pronounced in newer versions of the parser, suggesting that changes made to improve some aspects of parsing have inadvertently created new edge cases.
