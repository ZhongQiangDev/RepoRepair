### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The application crashes when rendering an empty checkbox list item.
**Cause**: The error message `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of undefined` suggests that the code is trying to access the `type` property of an object that is `undefined`. This likely happens because the parser or renderer is not handling empty checkbox list items correctly, leading to an undefined object being passed where a defined object is expected.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior of correctly rendering a checkbox is not met.
**Cause**: The underlying issue is probably in the parsing or rendering logic of the Markdown library being used. When it encounters an empty checkbox list item, it fails to properly parse or render it, resulting in an undefined object. This undefined object then causes the crash when the code attempts to access its `type` property.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Markdown library does not handle empty checkbox list items correctly, leading to an undefined object being passed to the rendering logic. This undefined object causes a crash when the code tries to access its `type` property. To fix this, the parsing or rendering logic needs to be updated to properly handle empty checkbox list items, ensuring that a defined object is always passed where expected.
