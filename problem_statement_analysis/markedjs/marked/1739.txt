Let me analyze the GitHub issue description and break down the problems and causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Comments with `-->` ending syntax are not being properly rendered/supported
**Cause**: The markdown parser appears to be treating `-->` differently than standard HTML comment syntax `<!--...-->`, likely due to incomplete HTML comment parsing implementation in version 1.1.1

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Empty lines within comments are not handled correctly
**Cause**: The parser seems to break comment blocks when encountering multiple empty lines, suggesting the comment parsing logic doesn't properly maintain the comment state across multiple blank lines

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between GitHub's preview and Marked's rendering
**Cause**: Different markdown parsers (GitHub's vs Marked) are implementing HTML comment handling differently, indicating a potential deviation from standard HTML comment specifications in the implementation

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around incomplete HTML comment parsing support in version 1.1.1. The main problems are:
1. Improper handling of comment end syntax (`-->`)
2. Breaking of comments when encountering multiple empty lines
3. Inconsistent behavior between different markdown parsers

These issues suggest that the HTML comment parsing implementation needs to be updated to:
- Properly recognize all valid HTML comment syntaxes
- Maintain comment state across multiple lines including empty lines
- Align with standard HTML comment specifications to ensure consistency with other markdown parsers
