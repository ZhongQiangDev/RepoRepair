Let me analyze the GitHub issue and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Task lists are being rendered as interactive checkboxes even when GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) is disabled with `gfm: false`
**Cause**: The Marked parser appears to be processing task list syntax (- [ ] or - [x]) independently of the GFM setting, treating it as a core feature rather than a GFM extension. This contradicts the GFM specification which defines task lists as a GFM-specific extension.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between table and task list rendering when GFM is disabled
**Cause**: The parser correctly respects the `gfm: false` setting for tables (not rendering them as tables) but fails to apply the same logic to task lists. This suggests an implementation oversight where the task list detection and rendering logic is not properly gated behind the GFM feature flag.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Output differs from CommonMark specification when GFM is disabled
**Cause**: The parser is not falling back to standard CommonMark behavior for task list syntax when GFM is disabled. In CommonMark, the `[ ]` should be treated as literal text within list items rather than being transformed into checkbox inputs.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from Marked's implementation not properly respecting the `gfm: false` setting for task lists. While other GFM features like tables are correctly disabled, task lists are being treated as a core feature rather than a GFM extension. This creates inconsistent behavior and deviates from both the GFM specification and CommonMark standard. The parser needs to be modified to properly gate task list rendering behind the GFM feature flag, ensuring that when GFM is disabled, task list syntax is treated as literal text just like in standard CommonMark.
