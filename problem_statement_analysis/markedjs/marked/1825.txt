### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Task lists are rendered even when `gfm: false` is set.
**Cause**: The `gfm` option in Marked is not properly disabling all GFM extensions, including task lists. This could be due to a bug in the implementation where the `gfm` flag does not fully disable all GFM-specific features, or there might be a separate configuration or default setting that is overriding the `gfm` flag for task lists.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The table is not rendered as expected when `gfm: false` is set.
**Cause**: When `gfm: false` is set, it correctly disables GFM extensions like tables, which is expected behavior. However, this indicates that the `gfm` flag is partially working, as it disables some GFM features but not others (like task lists). This inconsistency suggests a potential issue with how the `gfm` flag is applied to different GFM extensions within the Marked library.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `gfm: false` option does not fully disable all GFM extensions, specifically task lists, while it correctly disables others like tables. This inconsistency points to a potential bug in the Marked library where the `gfm` flag's implementation is incomplete or flawed. To resolve this, the library should ensure that setting `gfm: false` disables all GFM-specific features uniformly. This would align the behavior with the expected CommonMark standard and user expectations.
