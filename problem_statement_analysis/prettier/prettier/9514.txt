Let me analyze the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Slower parsing performance in Prettier affecting usability, especially during format-on-save operations
**Cause**: Current use of Babylon parser which is approximately 40% slower than Cherow based on benchmarks

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Cannot immediately switch to the faster Cherow parser despite its performance benefits
**Cause**: Cherow lacks Flow syntax support, which is a critical feature needed for JavaScript parsing in Prettier

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue presents two interconnected problems: performance limitations with the current Babylon parser and the inability to adopt a faster alternative (Cherow) due to missing Flow syntax support. While Cherow offers a 40% performance improvement over Babylon, its lack of Flow syntax support creates a blocking issue for implementation. The situation represents a trade-off between parsing speed and feature completeness. A potential solution would be to wait for Cherow to implement Flow support, as indicated by the author's interest in adding this feature (referenced in issue #35).

The performance impact is particularly noticeable in format-on-save scenarios where parsing speed directly affects user experience. This makes the resolution of these issues important for improving Prettier's overall usability.
