### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current JavaScript parser (Babylon) is slower than Cherow, which affects the overall performance of prettier, especially in a format-on-save scenario.
**Cause**: Babylon takes more time to parse JavaScript code compared to Cherow. According to the benchmark, Cherow is about 40% faster than Babylon. This difference in parsing speed can significantly impact the usability of prettier, especially when it is used in a format-on-save scenario where speed is crucial.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Cherow does not yet support Flow syntax, which is a limitation for its adoption as a default parser.
**Cause**: The lack of Flow syntax support in Cherow is due to the fact that the feature has not been implemented yet. Although the author of Cherow has expressed interest in adding support for Flow, it is not currently available. This limitation would block the use of Cherow by default in environments that require Flow syntax support.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the slower parsing speed of the current parser (Babylon) compared to Cherow and the lack of Flow syntax support in Cherow. The slower parsing speed of Babylon affects the overall performance of prettier, especially in a format-on-save scenario. The lack of Flow syntax support in Cherow is a limitation for its adoption as a default parser. Addressing these issues would improve the performance and usability of prettier.
