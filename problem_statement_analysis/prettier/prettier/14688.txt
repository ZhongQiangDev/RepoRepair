### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The trailing comma in the generic arguments list is removed by Prettier.
**Cause**: Prettier's `trailingComma: all` option is not preserving the trailing comma in the generic arguments list for `.mts` files. This is likely because Prettier's rules for trailing commas do not account for the specific requirement of TypeScript's `.mts` files, where a trailing comma is necessary to avoid syntax errors.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The TypeScript compiler raises an error when the trailing comma is removed.
**Cause**: TypeScript's `.mts` files have a specific syntax requirement where a trailing comma in the generic arguments list is necessary to avoid ambiguity with other syntax constructs. When the trailing comma is removed, the TypeScript compiler cannot correctly parse the generic arguments, leading to a syntax error.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Prettier is not preserving the trailing comma in the generic arguments list for `.mts` files, which is a requirement for the TypeScript compiler to correctly parse the code. This is likely due to a limitation in Prettier's rules for handling trailing commas in this specific context. To resolve this, Prettier may need to be updated to recognize and preserve the trailing comma in generic arguments for `.mts` files, or an alternative formatting tool that respects this syntax requirement may need to be used.
