### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The HTML table nested within the markdown list item is being indented further with each save, causing it to become misaligned.
**Cause**: The Prettier formatter is applying its default indentation rules to the HTML content within the markdown file. Since the HTML is nested within a markdown list item, Prettier is treating it as a nested block and adding additional indentation each time the file is saved.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue is intermittent with code blocks but persistent with raw HTML.
**Cause**: Prettier has different handling rules for code blocks and raw HTML. Code blocks are treated as a single unit of text, so once they are formatted correctly, Prettier does not alter them further. However, raw HTML is treated as a series of nested elements, leading to continuous indentation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The only way to prevent the issue is to turn off format on save or ignore markdown files.
**Cause**: The current settings of Prettier and VS Code do not provide a way to customize the formatting behavior for nested HTML within markdown files. This lack of customization forces users to disable formatting entirely for markdown files, which is not an ideal solution.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Prettier's default formatting rules are not suitable for handling nested HTML within markdown files. This results in continuous indentation of the HTML content, causing misalignment. The intermittent behavior with code blocks suggests that Prettier treats them differently, but there is no current setting to apply similar treatment to raw HTML. The lack of customization options forces users to disable formatting for markdown files, which is not a practical solution. To address this, users may need to explore custom Prettier configurations or alternative formatters that better handle markdown with nested HTML.
