Let me analyze the problem and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent comment formatting between `case` and `default` statements in switch blocks. The comment after `case` stays on the same line, while the comment after `default` gets moved to the next line.

**Cause**: Prettier appears to have different formatting rules for comments in `case` versus `default` statements. This inconsistency likely stems from how Prettier's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parser treats comments differently based on their location within the switch statement structure.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting doesn't respect the original code style intention where both comments were meant to be inline comments.

**Cause**: The formatter seems to treat the `default` case as a special condition where it assumes comments should be block-level rather than inline. This could be due to Prettier's internal rules for handling trailing comments in switch statements, where it might have special handling for the `default` case.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting creates inconsistent visual alignment between similar structural elements in the code.

**Cause**: The different treatment of comments disrupts the visual parallel structure between case statements, which goes against the principle of maintaining consistent visual patterns in code formatting. This appears to be a bug in Prettier's formatting logic rather than an intentional design choice.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around Prettier's inconsistent handling of comments in switch statements, specifically between `case` and `default` blocks. The formatter maintains inline comments for regular case statements but forces comments in default cases to their own lines. This creates both visual inconsistency and breaks the developer's intended code style. The root cause appears to be in Prettier's AST parsing and formatting rules that treat default case comments differently from regular case comments, likely due to internal rule differences in how trailing comments are handled in different parts of switch statements.
