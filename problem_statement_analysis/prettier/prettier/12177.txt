### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `default` case comment is moved to the next line after the `default` keyword, while the `case` keyword comment remains on the same line.
**Cause**: Prettier's formatting rules for `switch` statements treat `default` differently from `case` statements. Specifically, Prettier may be interpreting the `default` keyword as a standalone statement and thus moving the comment to the next line to maintain a consistent formatting style.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is for the `default` case comment to remain on the same line as the `default` keyword, similar to the `case` keyword.
**Cause**: This discrepancy could be due to a bug or an intentional design choice in Prettier's formatting rules. The parser might not be recognizing the `default` keyword in the same way as the `case` keyword when it comes to comment placement.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The inconsistency in comment placement between `case` and `default` can lead to confusion and make the code less readable.
**Cause**: The underlying cause is likely related to how Prettier's parser and formatting engine handle different parts of the `switch` statement. The parser might be applying different rules or heuristics for `case` and `default`, leading to this inconsistency.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Prettier's formatting rules treat the `default` keyword differently from the `case` keyword, causing the comment to be moved to the next line. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and reduced code readability. The underlying causes include Prettier's parser and formatting engine applying different rules for `case` and `default`, potentially due to a bug or intentional design choice. To address this, Prettier could be updated to apply consistent comment placement rules for both `case` and `default` keywords.
