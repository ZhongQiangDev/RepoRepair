### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The input `5 |> # * 2` results in a `SyntaxError: Unexpected character '#'`.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the pipeline operator in Prettier 1.17.1 does not support the smart pipeline proposal, which uses the `#` symbol as part of its syntax. The error occurs because the parser is not configured to recognize the `#` symbol in this context.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is not met, as the minimal pipeline proposal is supported instead of the smart one.
**Cause**: The configuration for the pipeline proposal is not set to "smart". The plugin needs to be explicitly configured to use the "smart" proposal to support the syntax used in the input.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error message does not provide clear guidance on how to fix the issue.
**Cause**: The error message only indicates that the `#` character is unexpected but does not specify that the pipeline proposal needs to be configured correctly. This lack of clarity can confuse users who are not familiar with the different pipeline proposals.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the smart pipeline proposal is not supported by default in Prettier 1.17.1, leading to a syntax error when using the `#` symbol. This can be fixed by configuring the pipeline proposal to "smart". Additionally, the error message could be improved to provide more specific guidance on resolving the issue. The overall solution involves ensuring the correct configuration of the pipeline proposal and enhancing the error message for better user experience.
