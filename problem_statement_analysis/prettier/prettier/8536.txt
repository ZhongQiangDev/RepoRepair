Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Extra trailing newline is added when a file contains only a directive followed by a comment
**Cause**: The printer.js file in Prettier is likely adding an extra hardline during the formatting process, specifically around line 199 as mentioned in the old details. This seems to be happening specifically with the babylon parser.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent handling of newlines between directive and comment blocks
**Cause**: The alignment size trim logic in index.js might not be properly handling the edge case where a file only contains a directive followed by a comment. The current implementation appears to treat these as separate blocks requiring additional spacing.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Quote style inconsistency in the output
**Cause**: While not the main issue, the formatter is also changing single quotes (`'use strict'`) to double quotes (`"use strict"`). This appears to be a separate formatting rule being applied alongside the newline issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from Prettier's handling of file structure when dealing with directives followed by comments. The formatter is adding an unnecessary extra newline at the end of such files, likely due to a combination of:
1. Hardline addition in printer.js
2. Incomplete trim logic for alignment sizing
3. Edge case handling for directive-comment combinations

The primary fix would need to focus on the newline handling logic, particularly for this specific file structure pattern, while maintaining proper formatting for other cases.
