### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prettier adds an extra newline at the end of the file when it contains only a directive followed by a comment.
**Cause**: The issue arises from the way Prettier handles the formatting of the directive and comment. Specifically, the `addAlignmentSize` function in the `printer.js` file (as mentioned in the old details) might be contributing to the addition of an extra newline. Additionally, the trim logic in the `index.js` file might not be handling this specific case optimally, leading to the extra newline.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected behavior is to have only a single newline at the end of the file, but Prettier is adding two newlines.
**Cause**: The current implementation of Prettier's formatting rules for directives and comments might not be considering the edge case where a file contains only a directive followed by a comment. This could be due to the way the parser interprets the structure of the file and applies formatting rules, resulting in the addition of an extra newline.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The extra newline is not consistent with the expected behavior of having only a single newline at the end of the file.
**Cause**: The issue might be related to the specific version of Prettier being used (1.10.2). Different versions of Prettier might handle formatting rules differently, and this particular version might have a bug or limitation that causes the extra newline to be added. Upgrading to a newer version of Prettier might resolve this issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main causes of the problem are the way Prettier handles the formatting of directives and comments, the specific implementation of the `addAlignmentSize` function and trim logic, and the version of Prettier being used. To fix the issue, the formatting rules for directives and comments could be adjusted to handle this specific case, the trim logic could be expanded to cover this common case, and upgrading to a newer version of Prettier could also be considered.
