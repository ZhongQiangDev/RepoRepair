### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: An unnecessary comma is inserted in the empty array `[]` when the `print-width` is set to 120.
**Cause**: This issue seems to be related to how Prettier handles the formatting of empty arrays in combination with the specified `print-width`. When the line length approaches the `print-width` limit, Prettier may attempt to break the line and add a trailing comma to maintain consistency with the `trailing-comma` option set to `all`. However, in this case, it incorrectly adds a comma inside an empty array, which is not valid TypeScript syntax.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The output on the user's computer shows an unexpected red squiggly line under the empty array `[]`.
**Cause**: This is likely due to the TypeScript compiler or the editor's linting rules flagging the incorrectly formatted empty array with the extra comma as a syntax error. The red squiggly line indicates that the code is not valid TypeScript and cannot be compiled or executed as-is.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The problem only occurs when the `print-width` is set to 120 and the length of the identifier is exactly this length.
**Cause**: This suggests that the issue is related to Prettier's line-breaking algorithm. When the line length reaches the `print-width` limit, Prettier tries to break the line and format the code to fit within the specified width. In this specific case, the combination of the identifier length and the `print-width` setting causes Prettier to incorrectly format the empty array.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that Prettier incorrectly adds a comma inside an empty array when the `print-width` is set to 120 and the identifier length is exactly this length. This is likely due to a bug in Prettier's line-breaking algorithm, which attempts to maintain consistency with the `trailing-comma` option but fails to handle empty arrays correctly. The red squiggly line in the user's editor confirms that the resulting code is not valid TypeScript and cannot be compiled or executed. To resolve this issue, the Prettier team may need to address the bug in their line-breaking algorithm and ensure that empty arrays are formatted correctly, even when the `print-width` limit is reached.
