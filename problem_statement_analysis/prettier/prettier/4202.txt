### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Excessive line length in the markdown table after processing.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the markdown table normalizing process does not impose any limit on the length of the contents within the table columns. When processing tables containing HTML content, such as those generated by `all-contributors`, the cleaned lines become excessively long, leading to lines with 865 characters as shown in the image.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The table formatting becomes less readable due to the long lines.
**Cause**: The table normalizing process replaces the usual three-dash pattern (`:---:`) with long lines of dashes to maintain alignment. This results in lines that are difficult to read and manage, especially when the table contains complex HTML content.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The original markdown table structure is altered in a way that may not be desirable.
**Cause**: The processing tool (Prettier) modifies the table by extending the separator lines to match the length of the longest content line. This alteration may not be necessary or preferred, especially when the original table structure with the three-dash pattern is sufficient and more readable.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of a line length limit in the markdown table normalizing process, which leads to excessively long lines and reduced readability. The current implementation replaces the three-dash pattern with long lines of dashes, altering the original table structure. To address these issues, the processing tool should detect cases with long lines and revert to using the three-dash pattern for better readability and adherence to the original markdown structure.
