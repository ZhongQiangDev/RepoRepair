Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Excessive line length in markdown table column separators after Prettier formatting
**Cause**: When Prettier processes markdown tables containing HTML/complex content (like all-contributors tables), it tries to align the separator row (with :---:) to match the full width of the content above it, resulting in extremely long lines (865 characters in the example)

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor readability of the formatted table source code
**Cause**: The excessive padding with dashes (-) in the separator row makes the markdown source harder to read and edit, while providing no additional value to the rendered output

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Unnecessary processing of specialized markdown tables
**Cause**: Prettier's markdown table formatter doesn't detect or have special handling for complex tables like all-contributors tables that already have a standardized format, leading to potentially disruptive reformatting

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent whitespace handling around the table
**Cause**: The formatted output adds extra blank lines around the table that weren't present in the original markdown, potentially affecting document spacing consistency

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around Prettier's handling of markdown tables containing HTML/complex content, particularly in the all-contributors format. The formatter attempts to normalize these tables by extending the separator row to match content width, resulting in extremely long lines that harm readability. This is compounded by unnecessary whitespace changes and lack of special handling for standardized table formats. The suggested solution is to detect such cases and fall back to simple three-dash separators (`:---:`), preserving the original format while maintaining consistent styling.
