### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The JSX formatting is unstable when using the `\u3000` character.
**Cause**: The `\u3000` character is a full-width space character commonly used in East Asian languages. Prettier may not handle this character consistently, leading to unstable formatting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The output changes between two different formats after multiple runs.
**Cause**: Prettier's formatting algorithm might be treating the `\u3000` character differently in various runs, causing the output to alternate between two states. This inconsistency could be due to how Prettier processes and normalizes whitespace characters.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The expected stable behavior is not achieved.
**Cause**: The current version of Prettier (1.19.1) may have a bug or limitation in handling specific whitespace characters like `\u3000`. This could result in the formatter not producing a consistent output across multiple runs.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the unstable formatting caused by the `\u3000` character. Prettier's handling of this specific whitespace character leads to inconsistent output. To achieve stable behavior, Prettier may need an update or a configuration adjustment to properly handle `\u3000`. The video demonstrates the issue in a real-world scenario, confirming the unstable formatting behavior.
