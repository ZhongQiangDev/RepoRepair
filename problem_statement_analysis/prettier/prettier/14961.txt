Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prettier 2.8.0 automatically adds spaces around pipe arguments in Angular templates, which deviates from Angular's official documentation style
**Cause**: Prettier implemented a change based on issue #13058 without thorough discussion with the Angular community, primarily considering feedback from Taiga UI users rather than following Angular's official style guidelines

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The added spaces make IDE hints (like WebStorm's argument names) look less clean and harder to read
**Cause**: The automatic spacing conflicts with IDE tooling that displays parameter hints, creating visual clutter and reducing code readability

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting is inconsistent with established Angular conventions and documentation examples
**Cause**: The change was implemented without considering the widespread existing usage patterns and examples in Angular's official documentation, where pipes are written without spaces between arguments

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The current implementation applies the same spacing rules to all pipe arguments regardless of their type
**Cause**: Prettier's formatting rule is too rigid and doesn't distinguish between different types of arguments (strings, numbers, expressions) which could benefit from different formatting approaches

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from Prettier 2.8.0 introducing a formatting change that adds spaces around Angular pipe arguments without proper community consensus. This change causes three major problems: 1) deviation from Angular's official documentation style, 2) reduced readability with IDE tooling, and 3) inconsistent formatting compared to established conventions. The root cause appears to be a decision made based on limited feedback rather than broader community input and established practices. A more flexible approach is suggested where spacing would depend on the argument type, maintaining readability while respecting existing conventions.
