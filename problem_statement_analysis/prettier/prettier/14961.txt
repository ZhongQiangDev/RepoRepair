### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prettier 2.8.0 is adding unnecessary spaces between pipe names and their arguments when they are strings or numbers.
**Cause**: The update in Prettier 2.8.0 was aimed at fixing a specific issue (https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/13058), but it did not consider the Angular community's coding style preferences. The Angular documentation and official examples consistently show pipes and their arguments without spaces when the arguments are strings or numbers. This discrepancy leads to a formatting style that conflicts with Angular's conventions.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The additional spaces added by Prettier 2.8.0 make the code less readable in certain IDEs like WebStorm.
**Cause**: WebStorm and other IDEs have specific features for displaying pipe arguments. When unnecessary spaces are added, these features may not work as intended, leading to a less aesthetically pleasing and potentially confusing code display. This can make it harder for developers to quickly understand the code's structure and functionality.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current behavior of Prettier 2.8.0 does not align with the expected compromise behavior suggested in the GitHub issue.
**Cause**: The suggested compromise was to add spaces only when the pipe argument is not a string or a number. However, Prettier 2.8.0 adds spaces in all cases, regardless of the argument type. This misalignment with the suggested compromise leads to inconsistent formatting that does not meet the expectations of the Angular community.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from Prettier 2.8.0's update, which introduces unnecessary spaces between pipe names and their arguments, conflicting with Angular's coding style conventions. This leads to reduced readability in IDEs like WebStorm and does not align with the suggested compromise behavior. To address these issues, Prettier should be updated to respect Angular's coding style preferences and only add spaces when the pipe argument is not a string or a number. This would ensure consistency with Angular's conventions and improve code readability in various development environments.
