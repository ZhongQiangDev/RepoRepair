### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Prettier fails to detect the language of a fenced code block when attributes are present after the language identifier.
**Cause**: The current implementation of Prettier's language detection logic does not account for additional attributes that may follow the language identifier in a fenced code block. It strictly expects the language identifier to be followed by whitespace or the end of the line, and any non-whitespace characters after the identifier cause it to fail in recognizing the language.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code inside the fenced block with attributes is not formatted according to the specified language rules.
**Cause**: Since Prettier fails to detect the language due to the presence of attributes, it does not apply the appropriate formatting rules for that language. As a result, the code remains unformatted or is formatted incorrectly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between different editors (Atom and VSCode) regarding the presence of a whitespace before the attributes.
**Cause**: The handling of whitespace before attributes in fenced code blocks is not standardized across different markdown parsers and editors. Atom and VSCode may have different implementations for parsing these attributes, leading to inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency can cause confusion and make it difficult to predict how the code will be formatted or displayed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Prettier's language detection logic does not account for attributes following the language identifier in fenced code blocks. This causes it to fail in recognizing the language and applying the appropriate formatting rules. Additionally, there is inconsistent behavior between different editors regarding the handling of whitespace before attributes, which can further complicate the issue. To resolve these problems, Prettier's language detection logic needs to be updated to handle attributes correctly, and a standardized approach for handling whitespace before attributes should be adopted to ensure consistent behavior across different editors.
