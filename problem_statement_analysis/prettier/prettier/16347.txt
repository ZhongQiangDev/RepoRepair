### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Empty lines within the `blogs` section are being removed by Prettier.
**Cause**: Prettier, by default, is configured to remove unnecessary empty lines within YAML frontmatter to maintain a clean and compact format. This behavior is part of its standard formatting rules for YAML, which may not preserve the original spacing intended by the user.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The removal of empty lines affects the readability and structure of the YAML frontmatter.
**Cause**: The removal of empty lines can make the YAML frontmatter harder to read and understand, especially when there are multiple sections with nested lists. This can lead to confusion and make it more difficult to maintain the document.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The formatting change could potentially disrupt the expected layout or functionality of the markdown document.
**Cause**: If the empty lines serve a specific purpose in the markdown document, such as separating sections or improving readability for certain parsers or rendering engines, their removal could cause unexpected behavior or visual issues when the document is rendered.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that Prettier's default behavior of removing empty lines in YAML frontmatter affects the readability and potentially the functionality of the markdown document. This is caused by Prettier's standard formatting rules for YAML, which prioritize compactness over preserving original spacing. To address this, users may need to adjust Prettier's configuration to preserve empty lines or manually add comments or other placeholders to maintain the desired structure.
