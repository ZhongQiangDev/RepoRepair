Let me analyze the problem and provide a structured answer.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Empty lines between blog entries in the YAML frontmatter are being removed by Prettier
**Cause**: Prettier 3.3.0's markdown parser is treating the YAML frontmatter content differently from the rest of the sections. While it preserves empty lines in sections like "docs" and "portfolios", it's removing them in the "blogs" section, likely due to inconsistent handling of array items in YAML blocks.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent formatting between different YAML sections
**Cause**: The formatter appears to be applying different formatting rules to different sections of the YAML frontmatter. While sections like "docs" and "portfolios" maintain their empty line spacing, the "blogs" section is being compressed. This suggests there might be an issue with Prettier's YAML parsing logic when handling nested arrays deeper in the document.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Loss of intended document structure
**Cause**: Prettier is making assumptions about YAML formatting that may not align with the author's intentions. The formatter is likely prioritizing compact output over preserving the original document structure, especially when it comes to vertical spacing between array items.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from Prettier 3.3.0's inconsistent handling of empty lines in YAML frontmatter, particularly within array structures. The formatter is removing intentional empty lines between blog entries while preserving similar spacing in other sections. This appears to be a bug in how Prettier's markdown parser interprets and formats YAML frontmatter, specifically affecting the preservation of vertical spacing in nested array structures. The behavior differs across different sections of the same YAML document, suggesting an underlying issue with the formatting rules for YAML content within markdown files.
