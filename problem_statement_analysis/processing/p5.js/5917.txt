### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Antialiasing on transparent regions blends with the background color.
**Cause**: When `premultipliedAlpha` is set to `false`, the antialiased edges of transparent objects are not correctly handled. The semitransparent pixels at the edges of the object are blended with the background color, leading to a tinting effect that ignores the background's alpha value. This occurs because the blending operation does not account for the premultiplied alpha, causing the RGB values to be incorrectly mixed with the background.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Transparent objects cut away the background.
**Cause**: With `premultipliedAlpha` set to `false`, the blending of transparent objects with the background is incorrect. The transparent regions of the objects do not blend smoothly with the background, leading to visual artifacts where the background appears to be "cut away." This is due to the blending function not properly handling the alpha channel, resulting in unexpected transparency effects. Additionally, the default blending function may not be suitable for transparent objects, requiring a custom blending function like `blendFunc(ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)` to achieve the desired visual result.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are related to incorrect handling of transparency and blending in WebGL sketches. When `premultipliedAlpha` is `false`, antialiasing on transparent regions blends incorrectly with the background color, and transparent objects do not blend smoothly with the background. These problems arise because the blending operations do not properly account for the alpha channel, leading to visual artifacts. To resolve these issues, enabling `premultipliedAlpha` and updating the blending functions and shaders to handle premultiplied alpha correctly are necessary steps. This will ensure that transparent objects and antialiased edges are rendered accurately, improving the overall visual quality of WebGL sketches.
