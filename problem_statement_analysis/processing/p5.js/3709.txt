Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The tint() function is not working in WEBGL mode while it works in Processing with OPENGL renderer
**Cause**: WebGL in p5.js doesn't have built-in support for the tint() function implementation, unlike Processing's OPENGL renderer. This is because WebGL handles textures and color blending differently from the 2D canvas renderer.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The alpha transparency (122 in the example) specified in tint(255,0,0,122) has no effect in WEBGL mode
**Cause**: The WebGL shader system would need specific modifications to handle alpha blending with textures. The current WebGL implementation in p5.js doesn't include the necessary shader code to process tint's alpha values when applying textures to 3D shapes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The red tint color (255,0,0) specified in tint(255,0,0,122) is not being applied to the textured shape
**Cause**: The WebGL texture rendering pipeline in p5.js currently applies textures directly without a color multiplication step that would be necessary for tinting. This would require additional fragment shader logic to multiply the texture colors with the tint color.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is that p5.js's WebGL mode lacks the implementation of the tint() function, which is available in Processing's OPENGL renderer. This affects three main aspects: overall tint functionality, alpha transparency, and color tinting. To fix this, the WebGL rendering pipeline would need to be modified to include proper shader support for texture color manipulation and alpha blending, similar to how Processing handles it in its OPENGL renderer. This is fundamentally a feature gap between p5.js WebGL and Processing OPENGL implementations.
