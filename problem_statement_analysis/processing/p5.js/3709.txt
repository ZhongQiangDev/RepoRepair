### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `tint()` function is not supported in the WebGL renderer in p5.js.
**Cause**: The WebGL renderer in p5.js does not have the necessary implementation for the `tint()` function. This function is used to tint images with a specified color, but the WebGL renderer does not have the required shader code or functionality to apply the tint effect to textures.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The example code provided does not produce the expected output when using the WebGL renderer.
**Cause**: The example code uses the `tint()` function, which is not supported in the WebGL renderer. As a result, the image is not tinted with the specified color, and the output is not as expected. Additionally, the `vertex()` function is used incorrectly, as it requires the texture coordinates to be specified in a different order.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `tint()` function is not supported in the WebGL renderer in p5.js. This is because the WebGL renderer does not have the necessary implementation for the `tint()` function. As a result, the example code provided does not produce the expected output when using the WebGL renderer. To fix this issue, the `tint()` function needs to be implemented in the WebGL renderer, or an alternative method needs to be used to apply the tint effect to images. Additionally, the `vertex()` function needs to be used correctly to specify the texture coordinates in the correct order.
