### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: In the MULTIPLY blend mode, the text appears as solid rectangles instead of displaying the expected transparency and blending effects.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the alpha channel of the text's pixels is being ignored in the MULTIPLY blend mode. This blend mode multiplies the color components of the source and destination pixels but does not consider the alpha channel, leading to the text appearing as solid rectangles.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text does not blend correctly with the background or other text layers when using the MULTIPLY blend mode.
**Cause**: The blending equation used in the MULTIPLY mode does not account for the transparency of the text. As a result, the text's alpha values are not factored into the blending process, causing the text to lose its transparency and blend incorrectly with other elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the MULTIPLY blend mode in p5.js does not properly handle the alpha channel of transparent textures, leading to text appearing as solid rectangles and blending incorrectly with other elements. This behavior is specific to the MULTIPLY blend mode and does not occur with other blend modes like ADD, which correctly handle transparency. To resolve this, the blending equation for the MULTIPLY mode should be adjusted to consider the alpha channel of the text's pixels.
