Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The quad shape appears self-intersecting/distorted in WebGL mode compared to 2D mode
**Cause**: The vertex ordering implementation in WebGL mode is incorrectly following QUAD_STRIP ordering instead of QUADS ordering. In QUAD_STRIP, vertices are processed one side after another, while QUADS should process vertices going around each quad in a consistent clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent rendering between 2D and WebGL modes for the same vertex coordinates
**Cause**: The WebGL renderer is not maintaining vertex order compatibility with the 2D renderer for the QUADS shape type. While the 2D renderer correctly processes vertices in sequence to form a proper rectangle, the WebGL renderer is connecting vertices in a different order, leading to visual inconsistency.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The fill color appears differently in WebGL mode due to the incorrect shape formation
**Cause**: Because of the incorrect vertex ordering in WebGL mode, the shape's face normal might be calculated incorrectly, affecting how lighting and fill colors are rendered on the surface. This is a secondary effect of the primary vertex ordering issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a fundamental difference in how vertex ordering is implemented between 2D and WebGL modes when using beginShape(QUADS). The WebGL implementation incorrectly uses QUAD_STRIP-style vertex ordering instead of proper QUADS ordering, resulting in self-intersecting shapes, inconsistent rendering between modes, and subsequent visual artifacts like incorrect fill color rendering. The primary fix needed is to align the WebGL vertex ordering implementation with the correct QUADS specification, ensuring it matches the 2D renderer's behavior of processing vertices in a consistent circular order around each quad.
