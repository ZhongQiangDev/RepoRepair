### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The quad rendered with `beginShape(QUADS)` appears with self-intersections in WebGL mode, resulting in a shape that looks like two triangles instead of a rectangle.
**Cause**: In WebGL mode, the vertex ordering for `QUADS` is treated the same way as `QUAD_STRIP`, which processes vertices in a sequential manner, creating two triangles that intersect. This is different from the 2D mode, where the vertices are processed in a consistent clockwise or counterclockwise direction to form a single quad.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The quad rendered with `beginShape(QUADS)` looks like a rectangle in 2D mode but not in WebGL mode.
**Cause**: The difference in rendering behavior between 2D and WebGL modes is due to the way each mode handles the vertex ordering for `QUADS`. In 2D mode, the vertices are processed in a way that forms a single quad, while in WebGL mode, the vertices are processed in a way that forms two triangles, leading to the self-intersection issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the difference in vertex ordering between 2D and WebGL modes when using `beginShape(QUADS)`. In WebGL mode, the vertices are processed in a sequential manner, creating two intersecting triangles, while in 2D mode, the vertices are processed in a consistent direction to form a single quad. To fix this issue, the vertex ordering in WebGL mode needs to be adjusted to match the behavior in 2D mode.
