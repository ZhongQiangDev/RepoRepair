Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The blending effect in WebGL mode appears different from the 2D mode, specifically for the MULTIPLY blend mode where the overlapping areas should show a darker purple color.
**Cause**: WebGL and 2D rendering use different rendering pipelines and blend mode implementations. The WebGL implementation of blend modes may not be properly mapping to the same OpenGL blend functions that would achieve the equivalent effect as the 2D canvas blend modes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The colors in the WebGL version appear more saturated and don't blend smoothly at the intersection.
**Cause**: This could be due to different color space handling between WebGL and 2D contexts. WebGL typically operates in linear color space, while 2D canvas operates in sRGB color space, leading to different color calculations when blending.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The blend mode setting appears to have minimal or no effect in WebGL mode.
**Cause**: The p5.js WebGL renderer might not be properly implementing the blendMode() function calls or translating them correctly to WebGL blend function parameters (gl.blendFunc and gl.blendEquation).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from inconsistent implementation of blend modes between WebGL and 2D renderers in p5.js. The problems manifest in three main ways: different blending effects, color space handling differences, and potentially incomplete WebGL blend mode implementation. The primary technical challenge appears to be properly mapping the 2D canvas blend modes to equivalent WebGL blend functions and equations while accounting for color space differences between the two rendering contexts.
