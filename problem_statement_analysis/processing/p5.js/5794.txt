### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` function does not produce the expected blending effect in WebGL mode. Instead of creating a darkened overlapping area where the red and blue circles intersect, the colors remain unchanged.

**Cause**: The issue likely stems from how WebGL handles blending compared to the 2D rendering context. In WebGL, blending is controlled by specific WebGL blending functions, and the default settings may not directly correspond to the expected `MULTIPLY` blend mode behavior. The `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` function in p5.js may not be correctly translating to the appropriate WebGL blending function, leading to the observed lack of blending.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The overlapping area of the red and blue circles in WebGL mode appears as a solid color rather than a blended color.

**Cause**: This behavior could be due to the way WebGL manages color buffers and blending operations. In WebGL, the blending equation and blending factors need to be set explicitly. If the `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` function in p5.js does not correctly configure these settings, the WebGL context will use its default blending method, which typically involves simple addition or alpha blending, rather than the desired multiplication of colors.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` function in p5.js does not correctly translate to the appropriate WebGL blending settings. This results in the WebGL mode not producing the expected blending effect, with the overlapping colors remaining unchanged instead of blending into a darker color. To resolve this, the p5.js library may need to adjust how it configures WebGL blending functions when `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` is called, ensuring that the WebGL context uses the correct blending equation and factors to achieve the desired visual effect.
