Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and provide a structured response.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect fill rendering in WebGL mode where an unexpected line appears from the lower part of the 'C' shape to its origin point
**Cause**: This is likely due to WebGL's triangulation algorithm for filling shapes. In WebGL, shapes are filled by breaking them down into triangles. When dealing with non-convex shapes (like the letter 'C'), the triangulation process may create incorrect triangles if the vertices aren't properly ordered or if the shape isn't properly defined for WebGL rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The shape rendering differs between 2D and WebGL modes
**Cause**: The fundamental difference in how 2D and WebGL modes handle shape rendering. 2D mode uses the canvas 2D context which has built-in methods for handling complex shapes, while WebGL requires shapes to be broken down into triangles. Without proper handling of concave shapes in WebGL mode, the triangulation process can produce unexpected results.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The fill extends beyond the intended boundaries of the letter 'C'
**Cause**: The shape is being closed automatically (due to CLOSE parameter in endShape()) without proper consideration of the internal space of the 'C'. In WebGL mode, this closing operation connects vertices in a way that creates unwanted triangles, filling areas that should be empty.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from how WebGL handles shape filling through triangulation, which is fundamentally different from 2D rendering. The main problems are:
1. Incorrect triangulation of the concave shape
2. Inconsistent rendering between 2D and WebGL modes
3. Improper handling of shape closure in WebGL mode

To fix these issues, the shape might need to be defined differently for WebGL mode, possibly by:
- Breaking the shape into simpler convex polygons
- Implementing proper triangulation for concave shapes
- Adding explicit handling for internal spaces in letters or similar shapes
