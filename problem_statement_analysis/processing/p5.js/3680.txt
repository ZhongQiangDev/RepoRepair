### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The fill of the letter C is not rendered correctly in WebGL mode. Instead of filling the intended shape, it creates a strange fill from the lower extremity of the C letter to the origin (top left of the letter).

**Cause**: The issue arises from the way WebGL handles the rendering of shapes. In WebGL mode, the `beginShape()` and `endShape()` functions use a different rendering algorithm compared to the 2D mode. Specifically, WebGL uses a triangulation algorithm to fill shapes. If the vertices are not specified in a way that WebGL can correctly triangulate the shape, it may result in unexpected fill patterns. In this case, the vertices provided do not form a simple, non-intersecting polygon that WebGL can easily triangulate, leading to the strange fill behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The shape appears to be filled incorrectly, with an unintended diagonal line connecting the bottom of the letter C to the top left corner.

**Cause**: The vertices provided for the shape do not form a convex polygon, which can cause issues with the triangulation algorithm used by WebGL. WebGL's triangulation algorithm works best with convex polygons. When the shape is concave, as in the case of the letter C, the algorithm may produce unexpected results, such as the unintended diagonal line. Additionally, the order in which the vertices are specified can affect the triangulation process. If the vertices are not specified in a consistent order (either clockwise or counterclockwise), it can lead to incorrect triangulation and, consequently, incorrect fill patterns.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the fill of the letter C is not rendered correctly in WebGL mode due to the way WebGL handles shape rendering and triangulation. The vertices provided do not form a simple, non-intersecting polygon that WebGL can easily triangulate, leading to unexpected fill patterns. Additionally, the shape is concave, which can cause issues with WebGL's triangulation algorithm. To fix this issue, the vertices should be specified in a way that forms a simple, non-intersecting polygon, and the order of the vertices should be consistent (either clockwise or counterclockwise).
