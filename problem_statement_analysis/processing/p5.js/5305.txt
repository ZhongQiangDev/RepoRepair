### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The browser shows generic error messages that may not be easily understandable by users, such as "Identifier {…} has already been declared" or "Missing initializer in const declaration."
**Cause**: The browser's default error messages are technical and may not provide enough context or guidance for users, especially beginners, to understand and resolve the issue.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users may encounter errors like "Illegal return statement" without understanding where or why the error occurred.
**Cause**: The browser message does not specify the context in which the return statement is illegal, such as being outside a function body, which can confuse users about the correct placement of the return statement.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Errors like "Cannot read property {…} of null" or "Cannot read property {…} of undefined" can be confusing as they do not clearly indicate the source of the null or undefined value.
**Cause**: The browser message does not provide information on why the variable is null or undefined, leaving users uncertain about how to fix the issue.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The error "Assignment to constant variable" may not clearly convey the problem to users who are not familiar with the concept of constant variables.
**Cause**: The browser message does not explain that values assigned to const variables cannot be changed after their initial assignment, which can lead to confusion about the correct usage of const.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: The error "Cannot access {…} before initialization" may not be clear to users who are not familiar with variable hoisting and initialization in JavaScript.
**Cause**: The browser message does not explain the concept of variable hoisting and the importance of declaring variables before using them, which can make it difficult for users to understand and fix the error.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary wrong behaviors identified are related to the lack of clarity and context in the browser's default error messages. The causes behind these behaviors include the technical nature of the messages, the absence of explanations for certain programming concepts, and the lack of guidance on how to resolve the issues. By adding more friendly error messages with explanations and links to relevant documentation, the `fesErrorMonitor` can help users better understand and address these errors, thereby increasing access to p5.js for beginners and improving the overall user experience.
