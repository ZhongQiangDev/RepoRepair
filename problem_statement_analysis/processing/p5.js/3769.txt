Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sphere is rendered incorrectly or not at all when switching between shaders
**Cause**: The render buffers are only created based on the attributes present in the shader that's active during geometry creation (in setup()), not considering attributes that might be needed by other shaders used later (in draw())

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing buffer attributes when using regular fill shader
**Cause**: The initial custom shader only has 'aPosition' attribute, so when the geometry is cached, it only creates buffers for this attribute. When the regular fill shader is used later, it expects additional attributes (like normals, texture coordinates) which weren't created during the initial geometry caching

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent geometry rendering across different WebGL implementations
**Cause**: Different WebGL implementations handle missing buffer attributes differently, leading to either incorrect rendering or complete failure to render, making the behavior unpredictable across different browsers or devices

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from p5.js's retained-mode geometry system creating buffer attributes based only on the current shader's requirements during geometry creation, rather than ensuring all potentially needed attributes are created. This leads to missing buffers when switching to shaders that require additional attributes, causing rendering failures or inconsistencies. The problem is particularly evident when switching between custom shaders with minimal attributes and regular fill shaders that expect a full suite of attributes. This implementation needs to be modified to either create all possible buffer attributes during geometry creation or handle dynamic buffer creation when new attributes are needed.
