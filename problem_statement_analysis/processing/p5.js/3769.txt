### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The sphere is not rendered correctly or not at all when a regular fill shader is used after creating and using a custom shader that lacks certain attributes.
**Cause**: The geometry's render buffers are created based on the attributes of the current shader at the time of geometry creation. If the current shader does not have a particular attribute, the corresponding buffer is not created. When switching to a shader that requires that attribute, the missing buffer causes rendering issues.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The cached geometry does not adapt to changes in the shader attributes.
**Cause**: The process of creating and caching geometry in the retained mode does not account for potential changes in the shader attributes. Once the geometry is cached with specific buffers, it cannot dynamically adjust to different shader requirements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The sphere's geometry is created and cached with insufficient buffers, leading to incorrect rendering.
**Cause**: The shader used during the `setup()` function does not include all necessary attributes, resulting in the creation of incomplete render buffers. When the shader is switched in the `draw()` function, the missing buffers cause the sphere to be rendered incorrectly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the fact that the render buffers for the geometry are created based on the attributes of the current shader at the time of geometry creation. If the current shader lacks certain attributes, the corresponding buffers are not created, leading to rendering issues when switching to a shader that requires those attributes. To fix this, the process of creating and caching geometry should account for potential changes in shader attributes and ensure that all necessary buffers are created regardless of the current shader. This could involve creating buffers for all possible attributes or dynamically adjusting the buffers based on the shader requirements.
