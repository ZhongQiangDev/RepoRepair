### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The square created by `p5.Geometry` is not drawn on the Android smartphone.
**Cause**: The UV information from the textured triangle remains in the texture registers when the square is drawn. Since the square has 4 vertices and the UV data only has 3 vertices, the insufficient data causes the Android environment to recognize this as an error and not draw the square.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The square is drawn correctly on the note PC but not on the Android smartphone.
**Cause**: Different environments handle insufficient UV data differently. The note PC seems to fill the missing data with zeros, allowing the square to be drawn, while the Android smartphone recognizes the insufficient data as an error and skips drawing the square.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is the handling of unused or insufficient UV data in the texture registers. The note PC and Android smartphone handle this situation differently, leading to inconsistent rendering results. The proposed solution involves disabling registers for unused attributes to prevent such issues. This change would ensure that the rendering process is consistent across different environments by explicitly managing the state of the registers.
