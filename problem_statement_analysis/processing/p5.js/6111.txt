I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: ortho() and frustum() functions are not correctly setting the near and far clip planes
**Cause**: The camera properties (cameraNear and cameraFar) are not being properly updated in the renderer's current camera object after setting the orthographic or frustum projection

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: frustum() defaults to ortho()-like parameters when called without arguments, causing objects to disappear
**Cause**: The default parameters for frustum() are incorrectly set to match orthographic projection values instead of perspective projection values, which is more appropriate for frustum projection

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inverted Y-direction in the projection matrix calculation
**Cause**: The sign for the Y component in the matrix calculation is not properly handled, leading to inverted vertical directions in the rendered scene

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Incorrect rotation behavior when swapping the 3rd and 4th arguments in ortho() and frustum()
**Cause**: The determinant of the projection matrix becomes negative when arguments are swapped, affecting the rotation direction. This needs to be compensated for by multiplying with the appropriate sign

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues primarily revolve around incorrect parameter handling and matrix calculations in the WebGL rendering pipeline. The main problems are:
1. Near/far clip planes not being properly set in the camera object
2. Inappropriate default parameters for frustum projection
3. Incorrect sign handling in matrix calculations affecting Y-direction
4. Rotation direction issues due to negative determinants when swapping parameters

These issues affect the basic functionality of 3D rendering and need to be addressed in the core WebGL implementation of p5.js.
