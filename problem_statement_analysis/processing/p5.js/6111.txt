### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ortho()` and `frustum()` functions do not correctly set the `cameraNear` and `cameraFar` values.
**Cause**: The issue arises because the `ortho()` and `frustum()` functions are not properly updating the internal camera properties (`cameraNear` and `cameraFar`). The values passed to these functions are not being reflected in the camera settings, leading to the default values being logged instead of the specified ones.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `frustum()` function behaves like `perspective()` when called without arguments, causing objects to disappear.
**Cause**: The default values for `near` and `far` in the `frustum()` function are set to `0` and `Math.max(this._renderer.width, this._renderer.height)`, respectively. This configuration results in a projection matrix that does not properly handle depth, causing objects to be clipped or not rendered correctly. Additionally, the sign of the `y` component in the matrix calculation needs to be reversed to correct the vertical direction.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The vertical rotation direction is reversed when the 3rd and 4th arguments of `ortho()` and `frustum()` are reversed.
**Cause**: This issue is caused by the determinant of the projection matrix being negative, which leads to an incorrect transformation. Multiplying by the sign of the determinant can resolve this problem, ensuring that the vertical direction is correctly oriented.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are related to the incorrect setting of `cameraNear` and `cameraFar` values, improper default behavior of the `frustum()` function, and incorrect handling of vertical direction in transformations. These problems stem from the internal implementation of the `ortho()` and `frustum()` functions, where the specified parameters are not correctly applied to the camera settings, and the default values and matrix calculations need adjustments. Addressing these causes will ensure that the functions behave as expected and produce the correct visual results.
