Let me analyze the problem and break down the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The border doesn't properly follow the rounded corners when borderRadius is set to 3 or higher
**Cause**: The border rendering algorithm in @react-pdf/renderer v1.0.0-alpha.25 likely doesn't properly calculate the border path for curved edges, causing misalignment between the border and the actual rounded corner of the View component.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Border distortion becomes more severe as borderRadius increases
**Cause**: The border drawing implementation appears to use a linear approximation or segments to draw curved borders, which breaks down with larger radius values. This suggests the border drawing algorithm isn't properly scaling or adjusting its curve approximation for different radius sizes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Border segments appear disconnected and jagged at higher borderRadius values (20, 30)
**Cause**: The border rendering system likely treats each side of the border as a separate segment without proper corner joining logic, causing gaps and misalignments at the corners when dealing with larger curve radii.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Border thickness appears inconsistent around the curved sections
**Cause**: The border width calculation doesn't properly account for the geometric adjustments needed when drawing along curved paths, leading to uneven border thickness especially at corner transitions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from @react-pdf/renderer's border rendering implementation having multiple limitations when handling rounded corners. The problems manifest as misaligned borders, disconnected segments, and inconsistent border thickness, all of which become more pronounced as the borderRadius value increases. These issues appear to be related to:
1. Inadequate curve approximation algorithms
2. Poor corner joining logic
3. Incorrect border path calculations for curved sections
4. Lack of proper geometric adjustments for border width along curves

This suggests the need for a significant improvement in the library's border rendering system, particularly for handling rounded corners with borders.
