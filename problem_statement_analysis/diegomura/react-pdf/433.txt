### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The border does not fully enclose the rounded `<View>` when `borderRadius` is set to 1.
**Cause**: The border rendering algorithm in `@react-pdf/renderer` may not be accurately calculating the border path for small `borderRadius` values, leading to incomplete border rendering.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The border starts to have issues and appears distorted when `borderRadius` is set to 3.
**Cause**: The border rendering algorithm may be struggling with the transition from sharp corners to rounded corners, causing the border to be improperly calculated and displayed.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The rendering becomes strange and the border appears disjointed when `borderRadius` is increased to 20.
**Cause**: As the `borderRadius` increases, the complexity of the rounded border path also increases. The current implementation of the border rendering in `@react-pdf/renderer` may not be handling the increased complexity well, leading to disjointed and strange border rendering.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The border rendering is even more distorted and disjointed when `borderRadius` is set to 30.
**Cause**: At higher `borderRadius` values, the border path becomes even more complex. The current border rendering algorithm in `@react-pdf/renderer` may be failing to accurately calculate and render the border path, resulting in highly distorted and disjointed borders.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue lies in the border rendering algorithm of `@react-pdf/renderer`. It struggles with accurately calculating and rendering the border path as the `borderRadius` increases. This leads to incomplete, distorted, and disjointed border rendering. Improvements to the border rendering algorithm are needed to better support rounded views and accurately render borders for different `borderRadius` values.
