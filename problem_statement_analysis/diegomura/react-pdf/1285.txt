### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Deprecation warning about `Buffer()` is shown when a PDF is rendered.
**Cause**: The code is using the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor, which is flagged as deprecated due to security and usability issues. This warning is triggered by `Node` versions `v10.15.3` or higher, which enforce stricter deprecation warnings.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The rendering process may break in future `Node` versions.
**Cause**: The `Buffer()` constructor is scheduled for removal in future `Node` versions. If the code continues to use `Buffer()`, it will fail when this constructor is removed, leading to a broken rendering process.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning is visible in the browser console.
**Cause**: The warning is logged to the console by `Node` when it encounters the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor. This is a standard behavior to inform developers about deprecated features and encourage them to update their code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the use of the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor, which triggers a warning and may cause the rendering process to break in future `Node` versions. The warning is logged to the console to alert developers. To fix these issues, the code should be updated to use `Buffer.alloc()`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`, or `Buffer.from()` instead of `Buffer()`. This will eliminate the warning and ensure compatibility with future `Node` versions.
