### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The styles defined for `ExampleText2` and `ExampleText3` are not being applied as expected. All three texts (`Text1`, `Text2`, and `Text3`) appear with the same styling, specifically the styling of `ExampleText1`.

**Cause**: The issue arises from the way `@react-pdf/styled-components` handles style inheritance and overriding. When extending styles using `styled(ExampleText1)`, the new styles are not being properly merged or overridden in the final rendered output. This could be due to a limitation or bug in the version of `@react-pdf/styled-components` being used (v1.2.0), where the styles are not being correctly propagated or merged in the final layout data.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout data in the blob shows that the styles are present but not applied correctly.

**Cause**: The structure of the layout data in the blob contains a mixture of CSS property keys and numeric indices, which might not be correctly interpreted by the rendering engine. This could be due to an issue with how the styles are being serialized or deserialized in the rendering process. The presence of `undefined` values and the mixed structure might indicate a bug or limitation in the current version of `@react-pdf/renderer` and `@react-pdf/styled-components`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The colors and border styles for `ExampleText2` and `ExampleText3` are not being applied as specified.

**Cause**: The specific properties like `border-top-width`, `border-bottom-width`, and `color` might not be supported or correctly interpreted by `@react-pdf/renderer` when used in conjunction with `@react-pdf/styled-components`. This could be due to limitations in the CSS properties supported by the rendering engine or issues with how the styles are being processed and applied.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from limitations or bugs in the version of `@react-pdf/styled-components` and `@react-pdf/renderer` being used. The styles are not being properly merged or overridden when extending components, and the layout data structure might not be correctly interpreted by the rendering engine. Additionally, specific CSS properties might not be supported or correctly applied. To resolve these issues, consider updating to a newer version of the libraries, checking for any known issues or limitations in the documentation, or using alternative styling approaches that are better supported by the rendering engine.
