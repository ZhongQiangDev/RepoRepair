Let me analyze the problem and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: All text elements appear with the same styling instead of having different colors and border styles as expected
**Cause**: The styled-components extension pattern (`styled(Component)`) may not be properly supported or implemented in @react-pdf/styled-components v1.2.0. While this pattern works in regular styled-components, the @react-pdf/styled-components library might handle style inheritance differently.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Style properties appear in the blob data but aren't being rendered correctly
**Cause**: The style object structure shown in the Chrome Console contains mixed CSS property keys and numeric indices with undefined values, suggesting that the style processing/transformation pipeline in @react-pdf/styled-components isn't properly handling the extended styles or converting them into the format that @react-pdf/renderer expects.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The styling API usage appears correct according to documentation but doesn't work as expected
**Cause**: There might be a version compatibility issue between @react-pdf/renderer and @react-pdf/styled-components. The documentation examples might be based on a different version where this functionality works correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from problems with style inheritance in @react-pdf/styled-components when using the styled(Component) pattern. The library appears to collect the style properties (as seen in the console output) but fails to properly apply them in the PDF rendering process. This could be due to:
1. Implementation limitations in the styled-components adaptation for react-pdf
2. Version compatibility issues
3. Incorrect style transformation between the styled-components format and react-pdf's expected format

A potential workaround would be to either:
- Use direct StyleSheet definitions instead of styled-components
- Use a different version of the libraries
- Apply styles directly rather than extending components
