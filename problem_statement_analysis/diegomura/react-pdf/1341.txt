### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The application throws a `TypeError: value.split is not a function` when using the `flex` keyword in CSS.
**Cause**: The error occurs because the `value.split` method is being called on a value that is not a string. In this case, the `flex` keyword is likely being passed as a non-string value (e.g., a number or an object) to a function that expects a string. This could be due to a bug in the code that processes the `flex` property, where it fails to properly handle the `flex` keyword as a string.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `flex` keyword is not being correctly interpreted by the CSS processing function.
**Cause**: The function responsible for processing the `flex` property might not be correctly identifying the `flex` keyword as a valid CSS value. This could be due to a lack of proper validation or parsing logic in the function that handles the `flex` property. As a result, the function attempts to call `value.split` on an invalid value, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error only occurs in the latest update (2.0.13) of the application.
**Cause**: The issue might have been introduced in the latest update due to changes in the codebase. It's possible that a recent modification or update to the CSS processing function has inadvertently broken the handling of the `flex` keyword. This could be due to a regression bug or an oversight during the development and testing of the latest update.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The `TypeError: value.split is not a function` error occurs when using the `flex` keyword in CSS due to improper handling of the `flex` property in the CSS processing function. The function fails to correctly identify the `flex` keyword as a valid CSS value and attempts to call `value.split` on an invalid value. This issue was likely introduced in the latest update (2.0.13) due to changes in the codebase. To fix this issue, the CSS processing function should be updated to properly handle the `flex` keyword and ensure that it is treated as a string value. Additionally, thorough testing should be conducted to prevent similar issues from occurring in future updates.
