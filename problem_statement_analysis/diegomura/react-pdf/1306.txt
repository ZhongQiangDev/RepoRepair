### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The type definition in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` does not support a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.
**Cause**: The `SourceObject` type definition in the code does not include a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as one of its possible types. According to the documentation, a function that returns a `Promise<string>` should be a valid source object, but the type definition does not reflect this.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The code snippet provided results in a compilation error.
**Cause**: The `src` prop of the `Image` component is being assigned a function that returns a `Promise<string>`, which is not a valid type according to the current `SourceObject` type definition. This mismatch between the expected type and the provided type causes the compilation error.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The documentation and the type definition are inconsistent.
**Cause**: The documentation states that a function returning a `Promise<string>` is a valid source object, but the type definition in the code does not include this as a valid type. This inconsistency leads to confusion and errors when developers try to use the library as described in the documentation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the inconsistency between the documentation and the type definition in the code. The `SourceObject` type definition does not include a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as a valid type, which leads to compilation errors when developers try to use such a function as the `src` prop of the `Image` component. To fix this issue, the `SourceObject` type definition should be updated to include a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as a valid type. This will ensure that the code matches the documentation and that developers can use the library as intended.
