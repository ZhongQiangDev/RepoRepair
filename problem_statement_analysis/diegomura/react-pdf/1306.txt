Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and break down the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Type mismatch between documentation and actual implementation for Image SourceObject
**Cause**: The documentation states that an Image source object can be a function returning a string or promise string `() => String | Promise<String>`, but the actual type definition in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` doesn't include this function type in its SourceObject definition.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Compilation error when using async function as image source
**Cause**: The current type definition for SourceObject only allows:
- string
- object with Buffer data and format
- object with URI and HTTP method details
But doesn't support function types that return promises, causing TypeScript compilation errors when trying to use async functions as image sources.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency between implementation and use cases
**Cause**: The implementation doesn't account for modern React patterns where dynamic image loading through async functions is common practice, limiting developers from implementing certain image loading patterns that should be valid according to the documentation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from a discrepancy between the documented API and its actual TypeScript implementation. The documentation suggests support for function-based image sources that can return promises, but the TypeScript type definitions don't reflect this capability. This leads to compilation errors when developers try to use async functions for image sources, even though it should be supported according to the documentation. The solution would require updating the TypeScript type definitions to include function types that return promises, as suggested in the problem description with the addition of `{(): Promise<string>}` to the SourceObject type.
