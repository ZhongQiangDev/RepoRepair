### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `margin: auto` property does not center the content as expected in v2.
**Cause**: There might be a change in the CSS handling or the layout engine between v1 and v2. The `margin: auto` property relies on the parent container's display properties and the content's width. If the parent container's display properties or the content's width are not set correctly, `margin: auto` may not work as intended.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual output in v2 appears different from v1, as shown in the provided image.
**Cause**: There could be a difference in the default styling or the way styles are applied in v2. This could be due to changes in the CSS reset, default margin/padding values, or the way the `react-pdf` library handles styles internally.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The snapshot tests show discrepancies between v1 and v2.
**Cause**: The discrepancies could be due to changes in the rendering engine or the way the library handles the layout and positioning of elements. There might be a bug in the new version that affects the layout calculation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the `margin: auto` property not working as expected and the visual discrepancies between v1 and v2. The causes could be changes in the CSS handling, default styling, or the rendering engine. To fix these issues, it would be necessary to investigate the changes between v1 and v2 and ensure that the `margin: auto` property is applied correctly and that the default styling and rendering engine are consistent.
