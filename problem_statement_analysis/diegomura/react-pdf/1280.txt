### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `flexBasis` property is not being respected, causing the text elements to not occupy the intended proportions of the container.
**Cause**: The `flexBasis` property is not supported in the version 2.0.8 of the library being used. This could be due to a regression in the library where the `flexBasis` property was not properly implemented or maintained in the newer version.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The text elements are overlapping and not displaying in a row as expected.
**Cause**: The `flexDirection: "row"` property is not being applied correctly. This could be due to a conflict with other styles or a bug in the library version 2.0.8 that affects the flexbox layout.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `alignItems: "center"` property is not centering the text elements vertically within the container.
**Cause**: The `alignItems` property might not be functioning as expected due to the same issues affecting the `flexBasis` property. This could be a result of the library's flexbox implementation being incomplete or broken in version 2.0.8.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of support for the `flexBasis` property in version 2.0.8 of the library, which leads to the text elements not occupying the intended proportions of the container. Additionally, there may be issues with the `flexDirection` and `alignItems` properties, which could be related to the same underlying problem with the library's flexbox implementation. To resolve these issues, consider downgrading to a previous version of the library where these properties are supported, or check for any updates or patches that address these bugs in version 2.0.8.
