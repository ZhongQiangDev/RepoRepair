### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The red flexbox element does not stretch to the full height of the page.
**Cause**: The flexbox container may not have the appropriate height set. If the container's height is not explicitly defined or set to 100%, the flexbox items will not stretch to fill the entire page height.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The red flexbox element does not stretch to the full width of the page.
**Cause**: The flexbox item may not have the correct flex properties set. If the `flex-grow` property is not set to 1 or the `flex-basis` property is not set to 0, the item will not stretch to fill the available space.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout in the PDF does not match the layout in the browser.
**Cause**: The CSS properties used in the browser may not be fully supported or interpreted the same way in the PDF rendering engine. This can lead to differences in how the flexbox layout is displayed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the height and width of the flexbox elements not being set correctly, and differences in how the layout is rendered between the browser and the PDF. To fix these issues, ensure that the flexbox container has a defined height, the flexbox item has the correct flex properties, and consider any limitations or differences in the PDF rendering engine when designing the layout.
