Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing read-only state implementation in the combobox component
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't include a read-only prop and associated styles, which is required according to the acceptance criteria. This affects the component's usability in scenarios where the value should be displayed but not editable.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of component location standardization
**Cause**: The component needs to be specifically coded in '/package/react' as per acceptance criteria, but this implementation detail is not yet addressed.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing playground controls for different states
**Cause**: The design shows different states (No input, Filled) but there are no controls implemented in the playground to toggle between these states, making it difficult to test and demonstrate the component's behavior.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Absence of default story implementation
**Cause**: There's no default story that developers can easily copy and paste, which hampers the component's reusability and integration into other projects.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of RTL testing implementation
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria requires RTL tests for the read-only class prop, but these tests are not yet implemented, potentially leaving the component's behavior untested in right-to-left contexts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The combobox component implementation has several gaps that need to be addressed:
1. The core read-only functionality and styling is missing
2. The component needs proper placement in the package structure
3. Playground controls for state management need to be implemented
4. A default story needs to be created for easy implementation
5. RTL testing coverage needs to be added

These issues primarily stem from incomplete implementation of the acceptance criteria, affecting both the component's functionality and developer experience. The fixes would involve systematic implementation of each missing feature while ensuring proper testing and documentation.
