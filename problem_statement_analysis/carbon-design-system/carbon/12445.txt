### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The combobox does not have a read-only state implemented.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks a prop for enabling a read-only state, and the necessary styles for this state are missing.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The combobox does not have controls for each state in the playground.
**Cause**: The playground lacks the necessary controls to demonstrate and test the combobox in different states, including the read-only state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no default story provided for easy copy and paste.
**Cause**: The documentation or storybook is missing a default story that developers can easily copy and paste to use the combobox component.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop are missing.
**Cause**: The testing suite does not include tests to ensure that the read-only class functions correctly in Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The combobox implementation needs to address several issues: adding a read-only prop and its styles, incorporating controls for different states in the playground, providing a default story for easy integration, and including RTL tests for the read-only class. Addressing these will ensure the component is fully functional, testable, and user-friendly in various scenarios.
