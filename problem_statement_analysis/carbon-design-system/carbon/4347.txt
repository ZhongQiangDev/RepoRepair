Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor contrast between the overflow menu and its background
**Cause**: The menu uses a grey color scheme that blends with the grey background, making it difficult to distinguish and read the menu options

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of a light theme variant
**Cause**: The component doesn't have a `--light` modifier implementation like other components (such as Text input) in the system, limiting its versatility in different UI contexts

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent design system implementation
**Cause**: While other components in the system (like Text input) have light/dark theme options, the Overflow Menu component lacks this feature, creating inconsistency in the design system

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around the overflow menu's visual accessibility and design system consistency. The grey-on-grey color scheme creates poor contrast, making the menu difficult to read. This is compounded by the lack of a light theme variant, which other components in the system already have. The absence of a `--light` modifier makes the component less versatile and breaks the consistency of the design system. Implementing a light theme variant would solve these issues by providing better contrast options and maintaining design system consistency.
