### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The grey menu on a grey background lacks contrast, making it difficult to read and visually distinguish the menu options.
**Cause**: The current color scheme of the menu uses similar shades of grey for both the background and the text, resulting in poor visual contrast. This reduces readability and makes it challenging for users to interact with the menu effectively.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The menu does not have a `--light` modifier, which is available in other components like the Text input component.
**Cause**: The absence of a `--light` modifier means that the menu cannot be easily adapted for use in lighter-themed interfaces. This lack of flexibility limits the component's usability in different design contexts, particularly in light mode interfaces where higher contrast is necessary.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The menu's design does not align with the overall theme when used in a light interface.
**Cause**: The current design of the menu is optimized for darker backgrounds, which may not integrate well with a light interface. This misalignment can disrupt the visual consistency of the user interface, leading to a less cohesive and user-friendly experience.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues with the current Overflow menu component are its poor contrast in grey-on-grey scenarios, the lack of a `--light` modifier for flexibility, and its design inconsistency when used in light interfaces. Addressing these issues by improving contrast, adding a `--light` modifier, and ensuring design consistency will enhance the menu's usability and integration within various interface themes.
