### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current overflow menu shadows in G90 and G100 themes have lower opacity compared to the G10 theme, leading to reduced contrast and visibility.
**Cause**: The opacity values for the shadows in G90 and G100 themes are set to 0.3, which is lower than the 0.3 used in the G10 theme. This lower opacity results in less contrast, making the shadows less distinct and harder to see against the dark background.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The page overlay for modals in the G90 and G100 themes uses a color of #161616 with a transparency of 70%, which may not provide sufficient contrast for users.
**Cause**: The current overlay color and transparency settings do not match the desired contrast levels. The proposed change to #000000 with 65% transparency aims to improve visibility and ensure better contrast with the underlying content.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current shadow and overlay settings in G90 and G100 themes do not align with the contrast levels of light themes like G10.
**Cause**: The design specifications for dark themes (G90 and G100) have not been updated to match the contrast levels of light themes. This discrepancy can lead to inconsistent user experiences across different themes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are related to the lower opacity of overflow menu shadows and the insufficient contrast of page overlays in dark themes (G90 and G100). These problems stem from the current design settings not aligning with the desired contrast levels of light themes. Adjusting the opacity of shadows and the color/transparency of overlays as proposed will help improve visibility and consistency across different themes. Ensuring these updates are implemented by the end of the year will support IBM Cloud's rollout of Dark Mode to clients.
