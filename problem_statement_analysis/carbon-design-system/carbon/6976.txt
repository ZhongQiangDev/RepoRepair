Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub issue description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: A `focusable="false"` attribute is being used on a `span` element
**Cause**: The OverflowMenu component in carbon-components-react is setting this attribute by default on span elements, but span elements don't actually support the focusable attribute, making it invalid HTML

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: `tabindex="0"` is explicitly set on a button element
**Cause**: The OverflowMenu component is adding this attribute unnecessarily since buttons are already focusable and included in the tab order by default in HTML. This creates redundant code.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: These accessibility-related attributes cannot be disabled or configured by developers using the component
**Cause**: The carbon-components-react library has hardcoded these attributes in the OverflowMenu component implementation (as seen in the referenced code links), without providing props or options to customize this behavior when it's not needed

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the OverflowMenu component using invalid or unnecessary accessibility attributes - specifically an unsupported focusable attribute on spans and redundant tabindex on buttons. While these don't break functionality, they represent poor HTML practices and accessibility implementation. The root cause appears to be hardcoded values in the component's source code without configuration options. The solution would involve:
1. Removing the invalid focusable attribute from spans
2. Removing the unnecessary tabindex from buttons
3. Potentially adding configuration options for cases where developers need to customize this behavior

These changes would improve code quality and follow HTML standards better while maintaining the same functionality.
