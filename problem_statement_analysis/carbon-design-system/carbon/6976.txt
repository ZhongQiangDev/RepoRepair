### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `focusable="false"` attribute is applied to a `span` element.
**Cause**: The `span` element does not support the `focusable` attribute. This attribute is typically used on elements that are not natively focusable, such as `div` or `span`, but it is not a standard attribute for `span`. The presence of this attribute on a `span` element is unnecessary and can lead to confusion or potential issues with accessibility tools.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `tabindex="0"` attribute is applied to a `button` element.
**Cause**: By default, `button` elements are focusable and included in the tab order, so setting `tabindex="0"` on a `button` is redundant. This unnecessary attribute can clutter the code and may confuse developers or accessibility tools that expect standard behavior from `button` elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The default values for `focusable` and `tabindex` are set in the `OverflowMenu` component.
**Cause**: The `carbon-components-react` library sets default values for `focusable` and `tabindex` in the `OverflowMenu` component, which may not be appropriate for all use cases. These default values are hardcoded in the component's implementation, making it difficult for developers to override them without modifying the library code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The `focusable="false"` attribute on a `span` element and the `tabindex="0"` attribute on a `button` element are unnecessary and can lead to confusion or potential issues with accessibility tools. These attributes are set as default values in the `OverflowMenu` component of the `carbon-components-react` library, making it challenging for developers to customize the component's behavior. To address these issues, the library could provide options to disable or customize these attributes, or the default values could be removed if they are not necessary for the component's functionality.
