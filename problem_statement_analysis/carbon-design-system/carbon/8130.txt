### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The light grey outline of the unselected tab does not achieve a 3:1 contrast against the background.
**Cause**: The current design uses a light grey color for the unselected tab's outline, which has a contrast ratio of only 1.1:1 against the background. This fails to meet the WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast requirement of a minimum 3:1 contrast for visual information required to identify user interface components.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The content switcher can be misidentified as a black button due to the lack of visual binding between the selected and unselected tabs.
**Cause**: The design does not provide sufficient visual cues to distinguish the content switcher as a single component. The absence of a contrasting outline around the unselected tabs makes it difficult for users to perceive the switcher as a unified interface element, especially in a 2-tab implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The divider between the unselected tabs in a 3-tab implementation has low contrast.
**Cause**: The divider between the unselected tabs does not meet the 3:1 contrast requirement. While it may not be strictly necessary for identifying the component, increasing the contrast of the divider can enhance the visual clarity and user understanding of the component's structure.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The content switcher fails to meet the WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast requirement due to insufficient contrast in the outline of unselected tabs and the divider between tabs. The primary causes are the use of light grey colors that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio and the lack of visual binding between selected and unselected tabs. Addressing these issues by increasing the contrast of the outline and divider will improve the component's accessibility and user experience. Additionally, conducting user testing with enhanced contrast treatments can further validate the effectiveness of these changes.
