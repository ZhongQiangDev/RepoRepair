### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The React application throws a warning about encountering two children with the same key, `Option`.
**Cause**: The `itemToString` function is being used to generate keys for the `MenuItem` components in the `ComboBox`. Since two items in the `items` array have the same `text` value (`'Option'`), the `itemToString` function returns the same key for both items, leading to duplicate keys.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The application may exhibit unexpected behavior, such as items being duplicated or omitted when the `ComboBox` is rendered.
**Cause**: React relies on unique keys to identify and efficiently update elements in the DOM. When duplicate keys are used, React may not be able to correctly reconcile the virtual DOM with the actual DOM, leading to potential issues like items being duplicated or omitted.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ComboBox` may not function as expected when selecting items with the same text but different IDs.
**Cause**: The `itemToString` function is also used in the menu option, which means that items with the same text will be treated as the same option, even if they have different IDs. This can lead to incorrect behavior when selecting items, as the `ComboBox` may not be able to distinguish between items with the same text.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the use of the `itemToString` function to generate keys for the `MenuItem` components in the `ComboBox`. This leads to duplicate keys when items have the same text, causing React to throw a warning and potentially leading to unexpected behavior. To fix this issue, it is recommended to use a unique `id` for each item as the key instead of the `text` value. This will ensure that each `MenuItem` has a unique key, allowing React to correctly reconcile the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and ensuring that the `ComboBox` functions as expected.
