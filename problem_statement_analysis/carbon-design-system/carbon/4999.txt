Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue description and code:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: React throws warning about duplicate keys in the ComboBox component
**Cause**: The ComboBox component is using `itemToString` function to generate MenuItem keys, which only uses the item's text property. When there are multiple options with the same text but different IDs (like in the example where two items have text: 'Option'), React detects duplicate keys since they generate the same string value.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential rendering issues with menu items
**Cause**: Due to non-unique keys, React's reconciliation process may have trouble properly maintaining component identity across updates. This could lead to unexpected behaviors like:
- Items being duplicated
- Items being omitted
- Incorrect state updates for menu items
- Performance degradation

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Component state management issues
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't properly utilize the unique identifiers (id: 'option-0', id: 'option-1') that are already available in the data structure. Instead, it relies solely on the text property which isn't guaranteed to be unique.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper key assignment in the ComboBox component's MenuItem rendering. Instead of using the `itemToString` function which only returns the item's text value, the component should prioritize using the unique `id` field as the key. This would:
1. Eliminate React's duplicate key warnings
2. Ensure proper component reconciliation
3. Improve rendering reliability and performance
4. Better handle cases where multiple options have identical display text but different values

The fix would involve modifying the key generation logic to use the unique `id` property instead of the text value returned by `itemToString`.
