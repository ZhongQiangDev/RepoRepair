### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "Show Code" button for the Notifications component displays `<FeatureFlags>` tags instead of the actual component code.
**Cause**: The code snippet being displayed is likely wrapped in a `<FeatureFlags>` component, which is used to conditionally render certain parts of the code based on feature flags. This suggests that the actual component code is not being properly extracted or displayed when the "Show Code" button is clicked.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The displayed code includes a placeholder `<No Display Name />` instead of the actual component name.
**Cause**: This could be due to a misconfiguration in the documentation generation process. The placeholder might be used as a fallback when the actual component name is not correctly identified or passed to the documentation system.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue might be affecting other components' "Docs" sections similarly.
**Cause**: If the problem is systemic, it could be due to a broader issue in the documentation generation tool or the way the code snippets are being handled across the entire documentation site. This might involve a common configuration or script that is incorrectly processing the code snippets for all components.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the "Show Code" button is not displaying the correct code for the Notifications component, instead showing `<FeatureFlags>` tags and a placeholder. This is likely due to a misconfiguration in how the code snippets are being extracted and displayed. The problem might be systemic, affecting other components as well, indicating a broader issue in the documentation generation process. Addressing the configuration of the `<FeatureFlags>` component and ensuring proper extraction of component names and code snippets should resolve the issue.
