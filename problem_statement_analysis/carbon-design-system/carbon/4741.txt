Let me analyze the problem and its causes based on the provided GitHub issue description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The copy button in CodeSnippet component is not correctly positioned when using 'single' mode
**Cause**: The `.bx--copy-btn` class is overriding the position property to 'relative' instead of maintaining the intended 'absolute' positioning, likely due to CSS specificity conflicts between the code-snippet and copy-button component styles.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: CSS import order causing style override issues
**Cause**: The current import order where copy-button styles are imported after code-snippet styles may be causing unintended style overrides. Since CSS follows a cascading nature, the later imports can override previous styles if they have equal or higher specificity.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Component style isolation is not properly maintained
**Cause**: The copy button component's styles are not properly scoped or isolated, allowing its base styles to affect the specialized use case within the CodeSnippet component. This suggests a potential architectural issue in how the styles are structured and namespaced.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from CSS specificity and cascade problems where the copy button's positioning is incorrectly set to 'relative' instead of 'absolute'. This is caused by three interrelated factors: style override conflicts between components, problematic import ordering of SCSS files, and insufficient style isolation between components. To fix this, the team would need to:
1. Review and adjust CSS specificity for the copy button positioning
2. Potentially reverse the import order of the SCSS files
3. Implement better style scoping for the components to prevent unintended style inheritance

The version information (Carbon Components 10.9.0 and Carbon Components React 7.9.0) suggests this might be a regression issue that needs to be addressed at the framework level.
