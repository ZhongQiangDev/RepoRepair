### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The copy button is not positioned correctly in `single` mode.
**Cause**: The `.bx--copy-btn` class is overriding the `position` style to `relative` instead of the expected `absolute`. This change in positioning causes the button to be misplaced relative to its intended location within the code snippet.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The style from the `CopyButton` component is affecting the positioning of the copy button.
**Cause**: The import order of the SCSS files might be causing the `copy-button` styles to override the `code-snippet` styles. Specifically, importing `copy-button` after `code-snippet` could lead to the `copy-button` styles taking precedence, resulting in the incorrect positioning.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The copy button appears to be misaligned with the code snippet content.
**Cause**: The CSS specificity or cascading rules might be causing the `copy-button` styles to override the `code-snippet` styles, even if the import order is correct. This could be due to more specific selectors in the `copy-button` styles or other CSS rules that are affecting the positioning.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect positioning of the copy button in `single` mode, caused by the `.bx--copy-btn` class setting the `position` to `relative` instead of `absolute`. This is likely due to the `copy-button` styles overriding the `code-snippet` styles, either because of the import order or CSS specificity. To resolve this, the import order should be reviewed, and the CSS specificity should be adjusted to ensure the `code-snippet` styles take precedence for the button's positioning.
