### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The container tabs do not truncate text with an ellipsis when the text exceeds the available space.
**Cause**: The CSS styles applied to the container tabs do not include text truncation properties such as `text-overflow: ellipsis`, `white-space: nowrap`, and `overflow: hidden`. These properties are necessary to ensure that text is truncated with an ellipsis when it overflows the container.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The container tabs do not align the truncated text 16px from the edge like the default tabs.
**Cause**: The padding or margin properties for the container tabs are not set correctly. The default tabs have a specific padding or margin that ensures the text is 16px from the edge, which is missing in the container tabs.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The container tabs need to be fixed by adding the appropriate CSS properties for text truncation and adjusting the padding or margin to align the text 16px from the edge. Specifically, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, `white-space: nowrap`, and `overflow: hidden` should be added to truncate the text, and the padding or margin should be set to ensure the text is properly aligned.
