### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `DatePicker` component in v11 does not accept a `ref` prop, leading to a warning that function components cannot be given refs.
**Cause**: The `DatePicker` component in v11 is likely implemented as a function component without using `React.forwardRef()`. This prevents the `ref` from being forwarded to the underlying DOM element, which is necessary for accessing the date picker input element.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The workaround using `querySelector` to find the date picker input element is not ideal and may break if the internal structure of the `DatePicker` component changes.
**Cause**: The `DatePicker` component's internal structure may change between versions, making the `querySelector` approach unreliable. This is because the `querySelector` relies on the specific HTML structure of the component, which is an implementation detail that may not be stable across different versions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `DatePicker` component's ref functionality is inconsistent between v10 and v11, causing issues for components that rely on the ref.
**Cause**: The `DatePicker` component in v10 likely used a different implementation that allowed refs to be passed through, possibly using class components or a different ref forwarding mechanism. The change to v11 without updating the ref handling has led to this inconsistency.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `DatePicker` component in v11 does not properly handle refs, likely due to the lack of `React.forwardRef()`. This causes problems for components that rely on the ref for functionality. The workaround using `querySelector` is unreliable and may break with future changes. To resolve this, the `DatePicker` component should be updated to use `React.forwardRef()` to properly forward refs to the underlying DOM element. This would ensure consistent behavior between v10 and v11 and allow components to reliably access the date picker input element.
