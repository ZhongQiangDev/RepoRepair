### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The searchbox is being referred to as "? Edit" or "Unlabeled# Edit" by JAWS.
**Cause**: The searchbox element does not have a proper label associated with it. This is likely due to the absence of an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute on the element with the `role="searchbox"`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The searchbox is not accessible to screen readers like JAWS.
**Cause**: The lack of a label makes it difficult for screen readers to identify the purpose of the searchbox, leading to confusion for users relying on such assistive technologies.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The searchbox is not properly integrated with the form field selection dialog.
**Cause**: The searchbox is not correctly identified as a form field, which is why it appears as "Unlabeled Edit" in the form field selection dialog. This could be due to the absence of a `name` attribute or other form-related attributes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of proper labeling for the searchbox element. This absence of labeling leads to incorrect identification by screen readers and improper integration with form field selection dialogs. To resolve these issues, the searchbox element should be properly labeled using `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes, and it should be correctly identified as a form field by including necessary form-related attributes.
