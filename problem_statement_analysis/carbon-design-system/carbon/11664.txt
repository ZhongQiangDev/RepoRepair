### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message about the `light` prop being deprecated is shown even though the `light` prop is not explicitly set in the code.
**Cause**: The `OverflowMenu` component might have a default value or a fallback mechanism that sets the `light` prop internally, even if it is not explicitly provided by the user. This could trigger the deprecation warning.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message suggests using the `Layer` component instead of the `light` prop, but it does not provide clear guidance on how to refactor the code to avoid the warning.
**Cause**: The deprecation warning lacks detailed instructions or examples on how to replace the `light` prop with the `Layer` component. This can lead to confusion for developers who want to update their code to avoid the warning.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message is logged in the console, which can cause issues in environments where console warnings are strictly monitored, such as in unit test suites.
**Cause**: The warning is logged using a console method (likely `console.warn`), which is not filtered out in the current setup of the unit test suite. This can lead to test failures or unnecessary noise in the test output.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `OverflowMenu` component is triggering a deprecation warning for the `light` prop even when it is not explicitly set, likely due to an internal default or fallback mechanism. Additionally, the warning message lacks clear guidance on how to refactor the code, and it can cause issues in environments where console warnings are strictly monitored. To address these issues, the component should be updated to avoid setting the `light` prop internally if it is not explicitly provided, and the warning message should include more detailed instructions on how to replace the `light` prop with the `Layer` component. Finally, the logging mechanism for the warning should be reviewed to ensure it does not interfere with environments that strictly monitor console output.
