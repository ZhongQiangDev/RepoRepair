### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The combo button takes up too much space in the navigation when all options are displayed.
**Cause**: The design currently shows all three actions by default, which leads to a cluttered navigation area. This can overwhelm users and make it difficult to focus on other important elements on the page.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The contextual menu may not be intuitive for all users.
**Cause**: While the contextual menu tested positively in usability testing, it may still not be familiar to all users, especially those who are not accustomed to this type of interaction. This can lead to confusion and a longer learning curve for new users.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual design of the combo button may not be consistent with the overall UI.
**Cause**: The combo button's design, including its color, shape, and placement, may not align with the rest of the user interface. This inconsistency can disrupt the user experience and make the button stand out in a negative way.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The combo button may not be accessible to all users.
**Cause**: The design may not consider accessibility guidelines, such as color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. This can make it difficult for users with disabilities to interact with the button and its options.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The combo button's design needs to be optimized to reduce space usage in the navigation, ensure intuitive interaction, maintain visual consistency with the UI, and meet accessibility standards. Addressing these issues will improve the overall user experience and make the button more effective for completing tasks.
