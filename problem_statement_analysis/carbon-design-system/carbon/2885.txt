### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: VoiceOver does not announce the "On" / "Off" labels when the toggle component is interacted with using the Enter or Space key.
**Cause**: The `aria-hidden="true"` attribute is applied to the spans containing the "On" and "Off" labels. This attribute hides the content from assistive technologies like VoiceOver, preventing it from being announced.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The toggle component is not properly accessible to screen readers.
**Cause**: The `aria-labelledby` attribute on the parent `<article>` element is not correctly linking to the toggle component's label. This can cause confusion for screen readers in determining the correct label for the toggle.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The toggle component may not be correctly identified as a checkbox or toggle control by assistive technologies.
**Cause**: The `<input>` element is of type "checkbox" but is styled and used as a toggle. This mismatch can confuse assistive technologies, which may not recognize it as a toggle control and may not announce its state correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the use of `aria-hidden="true"` on the "On" and "Off" labels, which prevents VoiceOver from announcing them. Additionally, the `aria-labelledby` attribute may not be correctly linking the toggle component to its label, and the `<input>` element's type may not be correctly reflecting its intended use as a toggle control. Removing the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute and ensuring proper ARIA roles and labels are used should resolve these issues.
