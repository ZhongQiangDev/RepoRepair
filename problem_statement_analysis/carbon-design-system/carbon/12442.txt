### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Duplicate `id` attributes are generated for `AccordionItem` and `Footer` components, leading to accessibility violations.
**Cause**: The `useId` hook in `carbon-components-react` and `@carbon/react` packages does not share the same context, resulting in the generation of identical `id` values. This is likely due to the packages being separate and not coordinating their `id` generation logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `id` prefix string is not configurable, making it difficult to avoid conflicts between components from different packages.
**Cause**: The `useId` hook does not expose an option to customize the `id` prefix string. This lack of customization prevents developers from ensuring unique `id` values across different components and packages.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue results in an accessibility violation, as duplicate `id` attributes can confuse assistive technologies.
**Cause**: Assistive technologies rely on unique `id` attributes to correctly navigate and interact with web content. When duplicate `id` values are present, these technologies may not function as intended, leading to a poor user experience for individuals with disabilities.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the generation of duplicate `id` attributes between `AccordionItem` and `Footer` components due to the lack of shared context in the `useId` hook. This results in accessibility violations and a poor user experience for individuals with disabilities. To address this, the `id` prefix string should be made configurable, allowing developers to ensure unique `id` values across different components and packages. Additionally, the packages should consider coordinating their `id` generation logic to prevent conflicts in the future.
