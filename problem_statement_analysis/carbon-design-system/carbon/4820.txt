Based on the provided GitHub problem description and screenshots, I'll analyze the accessibility (DAP) violations found in the dropdown component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessible name mismatch with visible label text
**Cause**: The aria-label or accessible name of the dropdown component does not match or contain the visible label text shown to users, violating a basic accessibility requirement that helps screen reader users understand the control matches what sighted users see.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Insufficient color contrast in disabled state
**Cause**: The contrast ratio of 1.71:1 between the foreground text and background colors does not meet WCAG AA minimum requirements for text of size 12px and weight of 400. The minimum required contrast ratio for normal text should be 4.5:1 to ensure readability for users with visual impairments.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessibility issues persist across different states (normal, disabled, and form invalid)
**Cause**: The component's accessibility violations appear in multiple states, suggesting that the accessibility considerations weren't properly implemented across all possible component states. Each state needs to maintain proper accessibility standards while communicating the state change to assistive technologies.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The dropdown component has three main accessibility issues that need to be addressed:
1. Mismatched accessible names that don't align with visible labels
2. Poor color contrast that fails to meet WCAG AA standards, particularly in the disabled state
3. Consistent accessibility violations across different component states

To fix these issues, the development team should:
- Ensure aria-labels match visible text
- Adjust the color contrast to meet WCAG AA requirements (4.5:1 minimum)
- Implement proper accessibility features across all component states while maintaining visual and functional clarity
