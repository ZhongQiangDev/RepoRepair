### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The accessible name does not match or contain the visible label text.
**Cause**: The `aria-label` attribute on the button element does not match the visible text "Open menu". This discrepancy can confuse screen readers and users relying on assistive technologies, as the accessible name should accurately reflect the visible label text.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The contrast of the foreground and background does not meet WCAG AA requirements.
**Cause**: The text color and background color combination results in a contrast ratio of 1.71, which is insufficient to meet the WCAG AA minimum requirements for text of size 12px and weight of 400. This can make the text difficult to read for users with visual impairments.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown title and helper text are not correctly identified as such.
**Cause**: The label and helper text elements are not properly associated with the dropdown component. This can lead to confusion for users relying on screen readers, as they may not understand the purpose or context of the dropdown.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The dropdown component has several accessibility issues that need to be addressed. The accessible name should be updated to match the visible label text, the contrast ratio of the text and background should be improved to meet WCAG AA requirements, and the label and helper text should be properly associated with the dropdown component. These changes will improve the overall accessibility and usability of the component for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
