### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current Tabs component does not match the desired secondary style as shown in the image.
**Cause**: The existing Tabs component in the project lacks the specific styling attributes required to achieve the secondary style, such as the blue underline for the active tab and the distinct font weight and color for the tab labels.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The active tab does not have a blue underline as shown in the image.
**Cause**: The CSS for the active tab state is missing or incorrectly configured, failing to apply the blue underline that is part of the secondary style.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The font weight and color of the tab labels do not match the desired secondary style.
**Cause**: The font styles (weight and color) for the tab labels are not updated to match the design requirements of the secondary style. This could be due to missing or incorrect CSS rules for the tab labels.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The inactive tabs do not have the correct background color and border as shown in the image.
**Cause**: The CSS for the inactive tab state is either missing or not correctly configured to apply the light gray background and the appropriate border as specified in the secondary style.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the lack of specific styling attributes in the current Tabs component to match the desired secondary style. The causes include missing or incorrect CSS rules for the active and inactive tab states, font styles, and background colors. Addressing these issues will require updating the CSS to incorporate the design elements shown in the provided image, ensuring compliance with the Carbon design system.
