From the provided GitHub problem description and image, this appears to be a feature request rather than a bug report. However, I'll analyze the potential design considerations that need to be addressed:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Current tab styling doesn't meet alternative design requirements
**Cause**: The Carbon Design System's default tab styling doesn't provide a secondary style option that matches the shown design mockup

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of design consistency with Carbon Design System
**Cause**: The proposed alternative tab design may not fully align with Carbon's design principles and guidelines, requiring design review and validation

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing component variant flexibility
**Cause**: The current Tabs component implementation doesn't support multiple styling variants or themes that would allow for this alternative appearance

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential accessibility concerns with new design
**Cause**: The proposed design needs to be evaluated for accessibility compliance, including contrast ratios, focus indicators, and other WCAG requirements

### Conclusion
**Summary**: This is primarily a feature request for adding a secondary style variant to the Carbon Tabs component. The main considerations revolve around:
1. Implementation of new styling options
2. Ensuring consistency with Carbon Design System guidelines
3. Making the component more flexible to support variants
4. Maintaining accessibility standards with the new design

The solution would require both design review and technical implementation to properly integrate this new tab style variant into the Carbon Design System while maintaining its quality standards and accessibility requirements.
