Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: CodeSnippet component lacks a proper disabled state when the value is not yet available
**Cause**: The component doesn't have a built-in "disabled" attribute in its implementation, forcing users to create workarounds with custom styling

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Keyboard focus is still active on disabled CodeSnippets
**Cause**: Without a proper disabled state implementation, the component remains keyboard focusable even when it should be disabled, creating accessibility issues

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Copy function remains active when CodeSnippet is meant to be disabled
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't provide a way to disable the copy functionality when the CodeSnippet is in a disabled state

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Visual feedback is inconsistent for disabled state
**Cause**: Lack of standardized design specifications for how the CodeSnippet should appear when disabled, leading to inconsistent user experiences

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the CodeSnippet component lacking proper disabled state functionality. This manifests in four key problems: no native disabled attribute, persistent keyboard focus when disabled, active copy function when disabled, and inconsistent visual feedback. The root cause is the absence of a comprehensive disabled state implementation in the Carbon design system's CodeSnippet component, both from a development and design perspective. The current workaround using custom styling is insufficient as it doesn't address accessibility concerns and creates inconsistent user experiences.
