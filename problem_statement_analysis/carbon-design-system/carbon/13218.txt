### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `caption` prop is declared in the `propTypes` for `ActionableNotification`, but it is not actually used or rendered in the component.
**Cause**: The implementation of `ActionableNotification` does not include logic to handle or display the `caption` prop. Even though the prop is defined in `propTypes`, it is not passed down to the relevant part of the component's JSX or rendered in any way.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Carbon component documentation suggests that `caption` can be passed as an attribute to `ActionableNotification`, but it does not render when a string value is provided.
**Cause**: The documentation is misleading because the `caption` prop is not actually implemented in the component. Users are led to believe that they can use this prop to add a caption like a timestamp, but since it is not implemented, nothing is rendered.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Users cannot complete the task of adding a caption to an `ActionableNotification` component.
**Cause**: The lack of implementation for the `caption` prop means there is no way for users to add a caption to the notification. This prevents users from achieving their intended goal of including additional information like a timestamp in the notification.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `caption` prop is declared but not implemented in the `ActionableNotification` component. This leads to misleading documentation and prevents users from completing the task of adding a caption to the notification. To fix this, the `caption` prop needs to be properly implemented in the component's logic and rendering process. Additionally, the documentation should be updated to reflect the current state of the component's functionality.
