### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ContentSwitcher` does not contrast visually on `ui-01` backgrounds.
**Cause**: The current color tokens used for the `ContentSwitcher` may not have sufficient contrast against the `ui-01` background, leading to poor visibility.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ContentSwitcher` lacks a `light` prop or variant.
**Cause**: The component does not include a `light` prop or variant, which could adjust its appearance to better contrast with lighter backgrounds like `ui-01`.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of visual contrast between the `ContentSwitcher` and the `ui-01` background. This can be addressed by either adjusting the color tokens used in the component or by introducing a `light` prop or variant, similar to the `TextInput` component. This would ensure that the `ContentSwitcher` is more visible and usable on lighter backgrounds.
