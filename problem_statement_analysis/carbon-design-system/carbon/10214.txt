Let me analyze the problem and its causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `...rest` props are being spread on the wrong element for sortable table headers. Specifically, they are being spread on the inner `<button>` element instead of the `<th>` element.

**Cause**: In the TableHeader component code, when `isSortable` is true, the `...rest` props are incorrectly placed on the button element (line 116 in the source) rather than the `<th>` element. This prevents important accessibility attributes like `id` from being applied to the table header cell where they belong.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent prop spreading behavior between sortable and non-sortable headers.

**Cause**: The code has different implementations for handling rest props:
- For non-sortable headers: `...rest` is correctly spread on the `<th>` element
- For sortable headers: `...rest` is incorrectly spread on the `<button>` element
This inconsistency creates confusion and makes the component behave differently depending on whether the column is sortable.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessibility issues with table headers due to improper attribute placement.

**Cause**: Because the `...rest` props (which may include important accessibility attributes like `id`) are being spread on the wrong element for sortable headers, it breaks compliance with accessibility standards like WCAG 2.0 (specifically H43 technique which requires proper header cell identification).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue is a misplacement of the `...rest` props spreading in the TableHeader component. For sortable headers, these props are incorrectly being spread on the inner `<button>` element instead of the parent `<th>` element where they belong. This creates inconsistent behavior between sortable and non-sortable headers and causes accessibility issues. The fix would involve moving the `...rest` spread from the button to the `<th>` element for sortable headers, maintaining consistency with non-sortable headers and ensuring proper accessibility attribute placement.
