### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `id` attribute is not being applied to the `th` element for sortable columns.
**Cause**: The `...rest` props, which include the `id` attribute, are being spread on the inner `button` element instead of the `th` element for sortable columns. This is evident in the source code where `...rest` is applied to the `button` element at line 116, but not to the `th` element.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `id` attribute is correctly applied to the `th` element for non-sortable columns.
**Cause**: For non-sortable columns, the `...rest` props, including the `id` attribute, are correctly spread on the `th` element at line 74. This allows the `id` to be applied as intended.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The inconsistency in the application of `...rest` props between sortable and non-sortable columns leads to an A11y issue.
**Cause**: The inconsistency arises because the `...rest` props are handled differently based on whether the column is sortable. This results in the `id` attribute being applied inconsistently, which can cause accessibility issues as described in the WCAG20-TECHS H43 guideline.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect placement of the `...rest` props for sortable columns. The `...rest` props, which include the `id` attribute, should be applied to the `th` element for both sortable and non-sortable columns to ensure consistency and proper accessibility. The current implementation applies `...rest` to the `th` element for non-sortable columns but to the inner `button` element for sortable columns, leading to the observed A11y issue. Fixing this by ensuring `...rest` is applied to the `th` element for all columns will resolve the problem.
