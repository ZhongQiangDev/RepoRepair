Let me analyze the pagination issues described in this GitHub problem:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The page selector dropdown extends beyond the browser viewport
**Cause**: The current implementation uses a Select component that displays all page numbers as dropdown options. With 650 entries and 10 items per page (resulting in 65 pages), the dropdown list becomes extremely long and exceeds the viewport height.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor user experience when trying to navigate to a specific page
**Cause**: Users have to scroll through a long list of numbers to find their desired page number, which is inefficient and cumbersome, especially when trying to reach pages that are far from the current page (e.g., jumping from page 1 to page 60).

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of direct page input capability
**Cause**: The current pagination component only implements a dropdown select mechanism instead of providing a text/number input field that would allow users to directly type their desired page number.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inefficient use of screen space
**Cause**: The Select component's implementation is not optimized for large datasets, as it attempts to show all available options at once rather than implementing a more space-efficient solution like virtualization or alternative navigation patterns.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from using an inappropriate UI component (Select dropdown) for handling large numbers of pages. The current implementation causes usability problems by:
1. Creating an oversized dropdown that extends beyond the viewport
2. Forcing users to scroll through long lists to find their desired page
3. Not providing direct page number input
4. Inefficiently using screen space

The solution would likely involve replacing the Select component with a more suitable pagination interface, such as:
- Adding a direct page number input field
- Implementing a more compact page selector
- Using a different navigation pattern that better handles large numbers of pages
- Potentially implementing page number virtualization for the dropdown if it must be retained
