### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The page selector dropdown extends beyond the browser window, requiring users to scroll up and down to find and select the desired page.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the page selector uses a `Select` component within the Pagination component, which is not optimized for handling a large number of options. As the number of pages increases, the dropdown list becomes excessively long, leading to poor user experience.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users cannot directly input the page number they want to navigate to, which is inconvenient when dealing with a large number of pages.
**Cause**: The current page selector only allows users to choose from a predefined list of options. There is no provision for a direct input method like a `TextInput` or `NumberInput` component, which would enable users to quickly jump to a specific page by typing the page number.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The page selector's dropdown list is not scrollable within a confined space, causing it to overflow the browser window.
**Cause**: The styling and layout of the dropdown list do not include a scrollable container. As a result, when the list of pages exceeds the visible area, it extends beyond the browser window, making it difficult for users to navigate through the options.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the current implementation of the page selector using a `Select` component, which is not suitable for tables with many pages. The dropdown list becomes excessively long, extends beyond the browser window, and lacks a scrollable container. Additionally, the absence of a direct input method for page numbers further complicates navigation. To improve the user experience, the page selector should be redesigned to include a scrollable dropdown list and an option for direct page number input.
