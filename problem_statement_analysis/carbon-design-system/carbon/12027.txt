### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The text in the accordion is not aligned flush to the left end of the line dividers.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the accordion component includes a `padding-left` before the text, which is causing the text to be indented and not aligned flush with the left end of the line dividers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The accordion content is not aligned properly when the accordion is open.
**Cause**: The content area of the accordion may have additional padding or margin that is not being removed when the `flush alignment` prop is applied. This can cause the content to appear misaligned with the rest of the accordion structure.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The accordion does not match the design specifications when the `flush alignment` prop is applied.
**Cause**: The implementation of the `flush alignment` prop may not be following the same structure as the `flush structured list variant` in React. This can lead to inconsistencies in the visual appearance of the accordion when the prop is applied.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are related to text alignment and content padding when the `flush alignment` prop is applied. The current implementation includes a `padding-left` that needs to be removed for proper text alignment. Additionally, the content area may have extra padding or margin that needs to be adjusted. Finally, the implementation of the `flush alignment` prop should follow the same structure as the `flush structured list variant` in React to ensure consistency with the design specifications.
