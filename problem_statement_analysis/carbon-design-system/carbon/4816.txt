Based on the GitHub problem description and screenshots, I'll analyze the accessibility violations and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The accessible name doesn't match or contain the visible label text
**Cause**: There's a mismatch between the aria-label value and the visible label text shown to users. The input field has an aria-label="Numeric input field with increment and decrement buttons" which doesn't match the visible "Number Input label" shown in the UI.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: WAI-ARIA widget with IMG role missing proper labeling
**Cause**: The SVG element with role="img" lacks proper accessibility attributes. While it has aria-hidden="true", when used as an image it should either have:
- A non-empty aria-label
- A non-empty aria-labelledby attribute
- Proper alternate text for screen readers

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Form validation error indication appears to lack proper accessibility
**Cause**: Based on the second screenshot showing the validation error state, there may be insufficient accessibility markup for communicating error states to assistive technologies. The error message "Number is not valid" needs to be properly associated with the input field using appropriate ARIA attributes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The number input component has three main accessibility issues:
1. Inconsistency between visible labels and aria-labels
2. Improper implementation of decorative/informative images lacking required accessibility attributes
3. Form validation states that may not be properly exposed to assistive technologies

These issues violate DAP (Digital Accessibility Program) requirements and need to be addressed to ensure the component is fully accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.
