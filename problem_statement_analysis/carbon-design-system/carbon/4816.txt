### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The accessible name of the input field does not match or contain the visible label text.
**Cause**: The `aria-label` attribute on the input field does not reflect the visible label text "Number Input label". This discrepancy causes the DAP violation as the accessible name should match or contain the visible label text for proper accessibility.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The WAI-ARIA widget with the `img` role is missing a non-empty alternate text or a label.
**Cause**: The SVG element with the `role="img"` attribute does not have an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute. This results in the DAP violation because screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on these attributes to understand the purpose of the image.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: 
- The first issue arises from the `aria-label` attribute on the input field not matching the visible label text, which can confuse users relying on screen readers.
- The second issue is due to the absence of `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes on the SVG element with the `img` role, making it inaccessible to users with visual impairments.
Both issues need to be addressed by ensuring that the accessible names and labels are correctly set to match the visible text and provide proper context for assistive technologies.
