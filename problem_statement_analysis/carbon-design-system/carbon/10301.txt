### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The icon-only Tabs variant does not currently support two sizes: 40px as default and 48px as large.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the icon-only Tabs variant lacks the necessary size prop to accommodate the two specified sizes. This could be due to the absence of a size prop in the component's props definition or the lack of conditional styling based on the size prop.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Line Tabs variant does not currently support the two sizes: 40px as default and 48px as large.
**Cause**: Similar to the icon-only Tabs variant, the Line Tabs variant may not have the size prop implemented. Additionally, the line thickness and spacing between icons might not be adjusted according to the specified sizes, leading to inconsistent visual representation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The ContainedTabs variant does not currently support the two sizes: 40px as default and 48px as large.
**Cause**: The ContainedTabs variant might also lack the size prop implementation. Furthermore, the container dimensions and padding might not be adjusted according to the specified sizes, resulting in a misalignment with the design requirements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue across all variants (icon-only Tabs, Line Tabs, and ContainedTabs) is the absence of a size prop that allows for the specification of two sizes: 40px as default and 48px as large. This absence leads to inconsistent visual representation and failure to meet the design requirements. Implementing the size prop and ensuring conditional styling based on this prop will address the wrong behaviors observed.
