Let me analyze the problem based on the provided GitHub issue and image.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The icon-only Tabs variant lacks size customization options
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't include a size prop that would allow switching between default (40px) and large (48px) sizes for icon-only tabs

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Icon sizes are not properly scaled according to the tab size
**Cause**: The icon sizes (16px for default and 20px for large) need to be properly implemented to maintain proportional scaling with the tab container sizes

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: ContainedTabs variant is missing the size customization feature
**Cause**: Similar to the Line Tabs, the ContainedTabs component hasn't been implemented with the size prop functionality to support both 40px and 48px heights

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of consistent sizing system across tab variants
**Cause**: The sizing implementation needs to be standardized across both Line Tabs and ContainedTabs to ensure consistent user experience and design system compliance

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the absence of a size prop implementation for both Line Tabs and ContainedTabs variants. This affects:
1. The ability to switch between default (40px) and large (48px) tab sizes
2. Proper icon scaling within the tabs (16px vs 20px)
3. Consistency across different tab variants
4. Overall component flexibility and usability

The solution would require implementing a size prop that controls both the container size and icon size appropriately for both tab variants, ensuring a consistent and scalable component system.
