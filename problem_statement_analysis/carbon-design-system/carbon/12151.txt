### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The fluid text input lacks a skeleton state, which is necessary for providing a visual placeholder while data is loading.
**Cause**: The skeleton state was originally left out of the specification, leading to an incomplete implementation of the fluid text input component.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual design of the fluid text input does not match the intended skeleton state as shown in the provided image.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the fluid text input does not include the specified background, border-bottom, and text styles for the skeleton state, resulting in a mismatch with the intended design.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The fluid text input may not provide a smooth user experience during loading times due to the absence of a skeleton state.
**Cause**: Without a skeleton state, users may experience a blank or unfinished look while the input is loading, which can lead to confusion or a perception of the application being unresponsive.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the absence of a skeleton state in the fluid text input component, which was left out of the original specification. This omission leads to a mismatch with the intended visual design and can negatively impact the user experience during loading times. To resolve these issues, the skeleton state should be added to the fluid text input, ensuring it includes the specified background, border-bottom, and text styles as shown in the provided image. This will enhance the visual consistency and improve the user experience by providing a clear placeholder during loading periods.
