Based on the GitHub problem description and the image provided, I'll analyze the issue regarding the skeleton state for fluid text input.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing skeleton state implementation for fluid text input component
**Cause**: The skeleton state was not included in the original specification, leading to inconsistency in the component's loading state representation

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of visual feedback during loading states
**Cause**: Without a skeleton state, users don't have a clear visual indication when the text input is in a loading or pending state

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent design system implementation
**Cause**: The skeleton styling variables ($skeleton-background, $skeleton-element, border-bottom) are defined but not properly implemented in the fluid text input component

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing responsive behavior for skeleton state
**Cause**: The skeleton state needs to maintain the fluid nature of the text input component, requiring proper scaling and responsive design implementation (as shown by the 12x and 16 measurements in the image)

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue revolves around the absence of a skeleton state in the fluid text input component, which was overlooked in the initial specification. This leads to several problems including:
1. Lack of proper loading state visualization
2. Incomplete design system implementation
3. Missing responsive behavior
4. Inconsistent user experience

The solution requires implementing the skeleton state using the defined styling variables ($skeleton-background, $skeleton-element) while maintaining the fluid and responsive nature of the component. The implementation should follow the design specifications shown in the image, including proper spacing and scaling (12x, 16) for different viewport sizes.
