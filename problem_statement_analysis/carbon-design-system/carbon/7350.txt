### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The context menu in Video 2 (Google Sheets) does not provide a clear visual indication of the selected cell or range when the menu is opened.
**Cause**: The design of the context menu does not visually highlight the selected cell or range, which can lead to confusion about which cell the actions will be applied to.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: In Video 3 (Slack), the context menu options for "Move channel" and "Additional options..." are not immediately clear in their functionality.
**Cause**: The labels for these options are vague and do not provide enough context about what actions will be performed, leading to uncertainty for the user.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: In Video 4 (CodeSandbox), the context menu options are not grouped logically, making it difficult to find related actions.
**Cause**: The menu items are listed in a flat structure without grouping similar actions together, which can make the menu harder to navigate and understand.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: In Video 5, the context menu does not provide keyboard shortcuts for all actions, which can slow down users who prefer keyboard navigation.
**Cause**: Not all menu items have corresponding keyboard shortcuts, which can reduce efficiency for power users who rely on keyboard shortcuts to navigate and perform actions quickly.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: In Picture 1, the context menu has a long list of options without any visual grouping or separation.
**Cause**: The menu items are presented in a single long list without any visual cues to group related actions, which can make it harder for users to find the desired option quickly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The identified wrong behaviors in the context menus across the videos and images include a lack of visual indication of the selected context, unclear or vague option labels, poor grouping of related actions, missing keyboard shortcuts, and an absence of visual grouping in long lists of options. These issues can lead to confusion, inefficiency, and a poor user experience. Addressing these causes by improving visual feedback, clarifying option labels, logically grouping actions, adding keyboard shortcuts, and using visual cues for grouping can enhance the usability of the context menus.
