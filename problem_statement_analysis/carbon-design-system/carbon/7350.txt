Based on the GitHub problem description and examples shown, I'll analyze the issues and causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of standardized context menu behavior across web applications
**Cause**: Each application implements its own custom context menu solution, leading to inconsistent user experiences and potential conflicts with browser native context menus

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Additional user interaction required with overflow menu (meatball icon)
**Cause**: Current implementation forces users to first click an overflow menu icon before accessing contextual options, adding an unnecessary step compared to native right-click menus

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Limited space for overflow menu triggers in complex layouts
**Cause**: UI layouts like data grids make it difficult to place overflow menu triggers without compromising the design or taking up valuable space

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent keyboard shortcut education
**Cause**: No standardized way to display and teach keyboard shortcuts for actions across different implementations of context menus

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential accessibility issues with custom context menus
**Cause**: Custom implementations may not properly handle keyboard navigation, screen readers, and other accessibility requirements that native context menus typically support

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues center around the lack of standardization in context menu implementations, which leads to several problems:
1. Inconsistent user experiences across different web applications
2. Inefficient user interactions requiring extra steps
3. Layout and space constraints with traditional overflow menus
4. Poor keyboard shortcut discovery and education
5. Potential accessibility challenges

A standardized context menu component would help address these issues by providing a consistent, accessible, and space-efficient solution that properly handles keyboard shortcuts and follows established UX patterns. This would improve both the developer experience (through standardization) and the end-user experience (through consistency and efficiency).
