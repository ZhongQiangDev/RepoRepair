### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `light` prop is not being passed down to the underlying `<Listbox>` component.
**Cause**: There might be an issue in the component's prop handling logic. The parent component might not be forwarding the `light` prop to the child `<Listbox>` component. This could be due to a missing prop spreading (`{...props}`) or an explicit prop forwarding mechanism that is not correctly implemented.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `bx--list-box--light` class is not being applied when the `light` knob is set to `true`.
**Cause**: The class name might not be conditionally applied based on the `light` prop. The component's rendering logic might not include a conditional check to add the `bx--list-box--light` class when the `light` prop is `true`. This could be due to a missing conditional statement or an incorrect class name mapping.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `light` prop is not affecting the visual appearance of the listbox as expected.
**Cause**: The CSS styles associated with the `bx--list-box--light` class might not be correctly defined or imported. This could result in the class being applied but not having any visual effect. Alternatively, there might be CSS specificity issues where other styles are overriding the `bx--list-box--light` styles.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to prop handling and conditional class application. The `light` prop is not being correctly passed down to the `<Listbox>` component, and the `bx--list-box--light` class is not being conditionally applied. Additionally, there might be CSS-related issues preventing the expected visual changes. Addressing these issues will involve reviewing the component's prop handling logic, ensuring proper conditional class application, and verifying the CSS styles.
