### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The invalid state does not clearly indicate the error to the user.
**Cause**: The error message is not visually distinct enough. The red border and icon might not be sufficient for users with color blindness or those who are visually impaired. Additionally, the error message placement might not be clear enough for users to immediately associate it with the incorrect radio button selection.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning state is not easily distinguishable from the helper text state.
**Cause**: Both the warning and helper text states use similar visual cues (yellow icons and text). This can lead to confusion for users who may not be able to differentiate between a warning and a helpful suggestion. The icon and text color should be more distinct to clearly differentiate the two states.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The helper text state does not provide any visual feedback to the user.
**Cause**: The helper text state lacks any visual indicators such as icons or color changes. This can make it difficult for users to recognize that there is additional information available. Adding a subtle visual cue, such as a small icon or a different text color, could help users notice the helper text more easily.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues with the RadioGroup implementation are related to the clarity and distinctiveness of the visual feedback for different states. The invalid state needs more prominent visual cues to clearly indicate errors, the warning state should be more distinguishable from the helper text state, and the helper text state should include a visual indicator to draw users' attention. Addressing these issues will improve the overall user experience by making the field validation errors more intuitive and accessible.
