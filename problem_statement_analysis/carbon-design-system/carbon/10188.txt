### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `title="[Object object]"` appears in the output of the selected icon.
**Cause**: The `itemToString` function is returning an object instead of a string. When the `title` attribute is added to the button in the Dropdown, it expects a string value. Since an object is being returned, it is converted to a string, resulting in `[Object object]`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The selected icon is not being rendered correctly in the dropdown.
**Cause**: The Dropdown component is using the `itemToString` function to render the selected item, which is not suitable for rendering complex elements like icons. The `itemToElement` function is more appropriate for rendering complex elements, but it is not being used for the selected item.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown visually works, but the selected item's title attribute is incorrect.
**Cause**: There is no prop available to determine which function (`itemToElement` or `itemToString`) is used to render the selected item in the dropdown. This lack of flexibility leads to the incorrect rendering of the selected item's title attribute.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the incorrect rendering of the selected icon's title attribute and the lack of flexibility in choosing the appropriate function for rendering the selected item. The `itemToString` function is returning an object instead of a string, leading to the `title="[Object object]"` issue. Additionally, the Dropdown component is not using the `itemToElement` function for the selected item, which is more suitable for rendering complex elements like icons. To fix these issues, a new prop should be added to determine which function is used to render the selected item in the dropdown.
