Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent prop naming across Carbon components - some components use `ariaLabel` while others use `aria-label`
**Cause**: Lack of standardization in the implementation of accessibility attributes across different components in the Carbon Design System. This has led to some components following camelCase naming (ariaLabel) while others follow kebab-case naming (aria-label).

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Some components accept both `ariaLabel` and `aria-label` props while others only accept one format
**Cause**: Incremental updates and changes to components over time without a coordinated effort to standardize the accessibility prop naming conventions. This has resulted in inconsistent prop support across the component library.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-compliance with React's official WAI-ARIA guidelines
**Cause**: React's official documentation explicitly states that aria-* attributes should use hyphen-case (kebab-case) in JSX, but some Carbon components are using camelCase instead, going against the recommended best practices.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential accessibility testing issues due to inconsistent prop naming
**Cause**: The inconsistency in prop naming could cause problems with automated accessibility testing tools and make it more difficult for developers to implement accessibility features consistently across their applications.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from inconsistent implementation of accessibility attribute naming across the Carbon component library. There are currently 13 components that need to be refactored to use the standard `aria-label` prop instead of `ariaLabel`. This inconsistency violates React's official WAI-ARIA guidelines, creates confusion for developers, and potentially impacts accessibility testing. The solution requires a systematic refactoring effort to standardize on the kebab-case `aria-label` format while maintaining backward compatibility through a deprecation process. This will improve consistency, maintainability, and adherence to React's accessibility best practices.
