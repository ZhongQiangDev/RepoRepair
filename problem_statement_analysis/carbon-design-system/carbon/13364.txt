### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency in the naming of the `ariaLabel` prop across different Carbon components. Some components accept `ariaLabel` while others accept `aria-label`.
**Cause**: The inconsistency arises from the lack of a standardized approach in the Carbon components library. Some components were developed following the camelCase convention (`ariaLabel`), while others follow the kebab-case convention (`aria-label`) as recommended by React's official documentation on WAI-ARIA.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Storybook documentation for some components mentions `ariaLabel` while the actual implementation accepts `aria-label`.
**Cause**: The documentation and the implementation are not in sync. This could be due to updates in the codebase that were not reflected in the documentation, or vice versa.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Some components only accept one of `ariaLabel` or `aria-label` and not both, leading to potential breaking changes for users.
**Cause**: The components were not designed with backward compatibility in mind. When changes were made to the prop names, the old prop names were not deprecated or supported alongside the new ones.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The official React documentation recommends using kebab-case (`aria-label`) for WAI-ARIA attributes, but some Carbon components do not follow this recommendation.
**Cause**: The Carbon components library may have been developed before the official React documentation was updated, or the developers may not have been aware of the recommended convention.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are inconsistency in prop naming, outdated documentation, lack of backward compatibility, and not following the official React documentation for WAI-ARIA attributes. To address these issues, the Carbon components library should standardize on using `aria-label` for all components, update the documentation to reflect the changes, and ensure backward compatibility by supporting both `ariaLabel` and `aria-label` during the transition period.
