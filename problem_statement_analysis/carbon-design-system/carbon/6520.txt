Let me analyze the issues and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent naming convention for the narrow grid mode
**Cause**: The documentation mentions a "narrow" grid (16px gutter) but there are no corresponding CSS classes that explicitly reference "narrow grid". This creates confusion between different grid types (narrow vs. condensed).

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Uneven spacing in the grid implementation
**Cause**: The current implementation using `bx--no-gutter--left` results in asymmetric padding, with more padding on the right side than the left side. This creates an unbalanced layout that doesn't match design requirements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of official support for the narrow grid mode
**Cause**: While the narrow grid (16px gutter) is mentioned in the documentation and appears to be used by design teams, there's no official implementation or clear guidance on how to properly implement it using the `bx--grid` system.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Disconnect between design and development implementation
**Cause**: Design teams are increasingly using the 16px gutter grid mode, but developers lack clear documentation and proper tools/classes to implement these designs in a Carbon-compliant way.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the narrow grid feature having incomplete implementation and documentation. The problems include inconsistent naming conventions, asymmetric spacing implementation, lack of official support, and a gap between design usage and development implementation capabilities. This creates confusion for both designers and developers trying to implement the narrow grid layout. The situation needs to be addressed through:
1. Standardizing the naming convention
2. Providing official CSS classes for narrow grid implementation
3. Ensuring symmetric padding/spacing
4. Creating clear documentation for both designers and developers
