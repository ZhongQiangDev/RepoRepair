### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The icons in the Line Tabs are not vertically centered.
**Cause**: The icons are aligned at the top of the tab, leaving a gap below them. This is likely due to incorrect vertical alignment settings or padding/margin issues in the CSS.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The icons in the Contained Tabs are not vertically centered.
**Cause**: Similar to the Line Tabs, the icons are aligned at the top of the tab, leaving a gap below them. This could be due to the same alignment or padding/margin issues in the CSS.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The spacing between the icons in both Line Tabs and Contained Tabs is inconsistent.
**Cause**: The spacing between the icons is not uniform, which can be caused by incorrect margin settings between the icons. The images show that the spacing is not consistent, which can lead to a visually unbalanced appearance.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The icons in the Line Tabs and Contained Tabs do not have the same visual weight.
**Cause**: The icons in the Contained Tabs appear to have a different visual weight compared to the Line Tabs. This could be due to differences in the background color, border, or padding settings, leading to a mismatch in visual consistency.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are the lack of vertical centering for the icons in both Line Tabs and Contained Tabs, inconsistent spacing between the icons, and a mismatch in visual weight between the two types of tabs. These issues are likely caused by incorrect alignment, padding, margin, and visual weight settings in the CSS. Addressing these causes will help in creating a more visually consistent and balanced icon-only variant for both Line Tabs and ContainedTabs.
