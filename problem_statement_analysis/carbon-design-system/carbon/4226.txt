### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Hyperlinks in the Breadcrumb component are missing link text or an image with alt text.
**Cause**: The HTML structure of the Breadcrumb component does not include descriptive text or alternative text for images within the hyperlink elements. This violates accessibility guidelines, as screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on this information to provide context to users.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Breadcrumb component fails to meet the DAP (Dynamic Accessibility Plugin) accessibility rules.
**Cause**: The DAP IBM Accessibility 1.8.0.0 ruleset specifically checks for the presence of link text or alt text in hyperlinks. Since the Breadcrumb component lacks this information, it triggers a violation. This indicates that the component's implementation does not fully adhere to the accessibility standards expected by the DAP tool.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Breadcrumb component's skeleton does not provide sufficient information for users relying on assistive technologies.
**Cause**: The absence of descriptive link text or alt text in the Breadcrumb component makes it difficult for users with disabilities to understand the purpose and destination of the links. This can lead to confusion and hinder navigation, especially for users who rely on screen readers to interpret web content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the Breadcrumb component in the React skeleton lacks descriptive link text or alt text within its hyperlinks. This omission causes a violation of the DAP accessibility rules and hinders the usability of the component for users with disabilities. To resolve this, the component's HTML structure should be updated to include appropriate link text or alt text for images, ensuring that it meets accessibility standards and provides a better user experience for all users.
