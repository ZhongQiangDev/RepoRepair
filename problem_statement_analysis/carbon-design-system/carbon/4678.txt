Let me analyze the accessibility issues with the Radio Button component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The screen reader cannot read the radio button label text in the React version, while it works correctly in the vanilla HTML version
**Cause**: The React implementation adds an unnecessary `aria-label` attribute to the label element, which appears to interfere with the screen reader's ability to read the actual label text. In the vanilla HTML version, the label text is properly associated with the radio button through proper HTML structure without extra ARIA attributes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Different HTML structure between vanilla and React versions affecting accessibility
**Cause**: The React version's label span element is missing the `bx--radio-button__label-text` class that is present in the vanilla version. This class may contain important styling or accessibility-related properties that help screen readers interpret the content correctly.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Redundant accessibility information in React implementation
**Cause**: The React version tries to provide accessibility through both native HTML labeling (using the `for` attribute) and ARIA labeling (using `aria-label`), which creates confusion for screen readers. The vanilla version relies solely on proper HTML structure with correct labeling.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the React implementation's departure from the vanilla HTML version's proven accessibility structure. The unnecessary addition of the `aria-label` attribute, missing CSS class names, and redundant accessibility implementations are causing screen readers to fail to properly announce the radio button labels. The solution would be to align the React implementation more closely with the vanilla HTML version by:
1. Removing the redundant `aria-label` attribute
2. Adding back the `bx--radio-button__label-text` class to the label span
3. Relying on proper HTML structure for accessibility rather than adding extra ARIA attributes
