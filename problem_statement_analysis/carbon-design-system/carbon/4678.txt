### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The screen reader cannot read the label of the radio button in the React version.
**Cause**: The presence of `aria-label="Radio button label"` in the React version's HTML is likely causing the screen reader to ignore the visible text label. The `aria-label` attribute is intended to provide an accessible name for an element when the visible text label is not sufficient or is not directly associated with the element. In this case, the visible text label is already correctly associated with the radio button via the `for` attribute, making the `aria-label` redundant and potentially conflicting.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The screen reader reads the label correctly in the vanilla HTML version but not in the React version.
**Cause**: The structure of the HTML in the React version differs slightly from the vanilla HTML version. Specifically, the `aria-label` attribute in the React version might be overriding the text content of the label, causing the screen reader to not announce the label text. In the vanilla HTML, the label text is directly associated with the input via the `for` attribute, which is the correct way to ensure screen readers can read the label.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The screen reader announces "selected, radio button, 1 of 3" without the label text in the React version.
**Cause**: The `aria-label` attribute in the React version might be causing the screen reader to announce only the `aria-label` content and not the visible label text. This can happen if the `aria-label` is not properly synchronized with the visible label text, leading to a mismatch in what the screen reader announces.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the unnecessary use of the `aria-label` attribute in the React version, which conflicts with the visible label text and causes the screen reader to not announce the label correctly. Removing the `aria-label` attribute and ensuring the label text is properly associated with the radio button via the `for` attribute should resolve the issue. The vanilla HTML version works correctly because it does not use `aria-label` and relies on the standard HTML structure for associating labels with radio buttons.
