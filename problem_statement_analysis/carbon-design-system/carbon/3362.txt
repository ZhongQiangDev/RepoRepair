Let me analyze the accessibility issue shown in the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `<label>` element has an invalid "role" attribute that violates WAI-ARIA standards
**Cause**: The code is incorrectly using a role attribute on a `<label>` element. Labels inherently have their own semantic meaning in HTML and don't need an explicit role definition. Adding unnecessary roles can confuse screen readers and other assistive technologies.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Improper implementation of WAI-ARIA attributes
**Cause**: The code attempts to modify the native semantic meaning of the `<label>` element by adding a role attribute. This goes against ARIA authoring practices which recommend using native HTML elements with their built-in semantics whenever possible, rather than overriding them with ARIA roles.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Redundant accessibility attributes
**Cause**: The code includes both the native HTML semantics (through the `<label>` element) and ARIA roles, creating redundancy and potential conflicts in how assistive technologies interpret the element.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around improper implementation of accessibility features in the FileUploaderButton component. The primary problem is the unnecessary addition of a "role" attribute to a `<label>` element, which violates Digital Accessibility Platform (DAP) standards and WAI-ARIA guidelines. The solution, as noted in the problem description, is straightforward: remove the "role" attribute from the label element. This will allow the native HTML semantics to function as intended and ensure proper accessibility support. This change will maintain the element's proper semantic meaning while complying with accessibility standards.
