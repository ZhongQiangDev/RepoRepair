### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ComboBox` component does not accept a `ref` prop, leading to a warning in the console.
**Cause**: The `ComboBox` component was refactored from a class component to a functional component in March 2021. Functional components do not natively support `ref` props unless they are wrapped with `React.forwardRef()`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message in the console indicates that attempts to access the `ref` will fail.
**Cause**: The `ref` prop is being passed directly to the `ComboBox` component, which is now a functional component. Functional components cannot directly receive `ref` props unless they are explicitly forwarded using `React.forwardRef()`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ref` prop is not being utilized as expected, preventing access to the underlying DOM element or component instance.
**Cause**: The `ComboBox` component does not have `React.forwardRef()` implemented, so the `ref` prop is not being forwarded to the underlying DOM element or component instance.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `ComboBox` component, now a functional component, does not support `ref` props due to the lack of `React.forwardRef()` implementation. This results in a warning in the console and prevents the `ref` from being used as intended. To resolve this, the `ComboBox` component should be updated to use `React.forwardRef()` to properly forward the `ref` prop. This would allow the `ref` to be passed down to the underlying DOM element or component instance, enabling the desired functionality without triggering the warning.
