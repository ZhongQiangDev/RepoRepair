### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current button sizes do not include `xl` and `large` variants.
**Cause**: The existing button component lacks the specified `xl` (80px height) and `large` (64px height) size variants, which are necessary for the new creation flow pattern and for consistency with modal buttons.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Smaller buttons at the bottom right of the page can be easily overlooked.
**Cause**: The current button sizes may not provide sufficient visual weight or prominence, leading to usability issues where users might miss important actions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency in button sizes across different components.
**Cause**: The existing button sizes do not match the sizes used in modal components, leading to a lack of visual consistency in the user interface.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the absence of `xl` and `large` button size variants, the potential for smaller buttons to be overlooked, and inconsistency in button sizes across different components. These issues can be addressed by adding the specified button size variants, ensuring that buttons have sufficient visual weight, and maintaining consistent button sizes throughout the interface.
