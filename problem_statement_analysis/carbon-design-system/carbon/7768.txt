Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: VoiceOver reads dropdown items twice when navigating through them
**Cause**: This is likely due to improper ARIA labeling or duplicate text content in the dropdown implementation. The issue could be caused by:
1. Multiple ARIA labels or descriptions being applied to the same element
2. The text content being present both in the visible label and in an aria-label attribute
3. Nested elements with redundant text content

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown implementation may not fully comply with WCAG 2.1 Info and Relationships guidelines
**Cause**: The structure and relationship of information in the dropdown might not be properly conveyed to assistive technologies because:
1. The semantic structure of the dropdown menu might not be correctly implemented
2. The relationship between the dropdown button and its items might not be properly defined using appropriate ARIA roles and attributes
3. The component might be missing proper parent-child relationships in its DOM structure

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that VoiceOver reads dropdown items twice, which creates a poor user experience for users relying on screen readers. This appears to be caused by either duplicate accessibility information in the component implementation or improper ARIA relationships between elements. The problem violates WCAG 2.1 guidelines regarding info and relationships, suggesting that the semantic structure and relationships between elements need to be reviewed and corrected. To fix this, the development team should:

1. Audit the ARIA labels and descriptions used in the dropdown
2. Ensure there's no duplicate text content in the DOM
3. Verify the proper implementation of ARIA roles and relationships
4. Test the component thoroughly with VoiceOver to ensure proper screen reader behavior
