### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Voiceover reads dropdown items twice.
**Cause**: The issue likely stems from the way the dropdown items are being announced by the Voiceover. It appears that the Voiceover is reading both the visible text and the ARIA label or description, which might be redundant. This could be due to improper ARIA attributes being set on the dropdown items, causing the Voiceover to interpret and announce the same information twice.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Voiceover reads the item's position in the list (e.g., "5 of 6") along with the item text.
**Cause**: The Voiceover might be configured to announce the position of the item within the list, which could be contributing to the redundancy. This behavior can be controlled by the Voiceover settings or the ARIA attributes on the dropdown items. If the ARIA attributes are not set correctly, the Voiceover might announce both the item text and its position, leading to the perception that the item is being read twice.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Voiceover reads the item text and its selected state (e.g., "Option 4, selected").
**Cause**: The Voiceover might be announcing the selected state of the item along with its text, which could be contributing to the redundancy. This behavior can be controlled by the Voiceover settings or the ARIA attributes on the dropdown items. If the ARIA attributes are not set correctly, the Voiceover might announce both the item text and its selected state, leading to the perception that the item is being read twice.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary cause of the issue is likely related to the improper use of ARIA attributes on the dropdown items, causing the Voiceover to announce the same information twice. The Voiceover settings might also be contributing to the redundancy by announcing the position and selected state of the items. To fix this issue, the ARIA attributes on the dropdown items should be reviewed and set correctly, and the Voiceover settings should be adjusted to ensure that the items are announced only once.
