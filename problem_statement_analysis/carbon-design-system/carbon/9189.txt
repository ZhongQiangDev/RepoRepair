### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The breadcrumb overflow does not display the shark fin and offset as expected.
**Cause**: The `displayName` of the `OverflowMenu` component is being set to `"FeatureToggle(OverflowMenu)"` instead of `"OverflowMenu"`. This is likely due to the `createComponentToggle` function, which wraps the original `OverflowMenu` component and changes its `displayName`. As a result, the condition `children.type.displayName === 'OverflowMenu'` in the `BreadcrumbItem` component fails, preventing the shark fin and offset from being rendered.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `OverflowMenu` component is not being recognized correctly within the `BreadcrumbItem` component.
**Cause**: The `createComponentToggle` function introduces a wrapper around the `OverflowMenu` component, changing its `displayName` to `"FeatureToggle(OverflowMenu)"`. This alteration causes the `BreadcrumbItem` component's conditional check to fail, as it specifically looks for a `displayName` of `"OverflowMenu"`. Consequently, the logic intended for handling the `OverflowMenu` is bypassed.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue stems from the `createComponentToggle` function, which modifies the `displayName` of the `OverflowMenu` component. This modification causes the conditional logic in the `BreadcrumbItem` component to fail, leading to the absence of the shark fin and offset in the breadcrumb overflow. To resolve this, the `BreadcrumbItem` component should be updated to recognize the new `displayName` or the `createComponentToggle` function should be adjusted to preserve the original `displayName` of the `OverflowMenu` component.
