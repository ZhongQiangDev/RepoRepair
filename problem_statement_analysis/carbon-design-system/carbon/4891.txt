### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The cancel search icon button has poor color contrast against the `skyblue` background color introduced by Chrome's autofill feature.
**Cause**: The color of the cancel search icon button has not been updated to maintain sufficient contrast when the background color changes to `skyblue` due to Chrome's autofill.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The search input field's background color changes to `skyblue` when autofilled by Chrome, which affects the visibility of the cancel search icon button.
**Cause**: Chrome's autofill feature automatically applies a `skyblue` background color to the input field, which was not anticipated in the design of the cancel search icon button's color.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the poor color contrast of the cancel search icon button when the background color changes to `skyblue` due to Chrome's autofill feature. This is caused by the lack of adjustment in the icon button's color to maintain sufficient contrast under the new background condition. To resolve this, the color of the cancel search icon button should be updated to ensure it remains visible and accessible regardless of the background color changes introduced by Chrome's autofill.
