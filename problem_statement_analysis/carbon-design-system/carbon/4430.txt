### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: After searching for specific items, clicking the "Select All" checkbox selects all items in the table, not just the filtered items.
**Cause**: The "Select All" checkbox is likely programmed to select all items in the entire dataset rather than just the items currently visible after filtering. This could be due to the checkbox not being aware of the current filter state or not being updated to reflect the filtered dataset.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The expectation is to select only the filtered items, but the result includes all items in the table.
**Cause**: The implementation of the "Select All" functionality might not be considering the current view or filtered state of the table. It could be selecting items based on the original dataset instead of the filtered dataset.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user interface does not provide clear feedback that only the filtered items should be selected when using "Select All" after a search.
**Cause**: There might be a lack of clear documentation or user interface cues indicating that the "Select All" checkbox should only apply to the currently visible items after a search. This can lead to user confusion and unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the "Select All" checkbox is not functioning as expected when used after filtering the table. The checkbox is selecting all items in the original dataset instead of just the filtered items. This could be due to the checkbox not being aware of the current filter state or not being updated to reflect the filtered dataset. Additionally, there is a lack of clear user interface cues or documentation indicating the expected behavior of the "Select All" checkbox after a search. To fix this issue, the "Select All" checkbox should be updated to only select the currently visible items after a search, and clear user interface cues or documentation should be provided to indicate this behavior.
