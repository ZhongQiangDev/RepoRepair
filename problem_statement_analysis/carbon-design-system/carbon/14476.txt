### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `TableBatchActions` component currently does not have an option to include a "Select all" button.
**Cause**: The component's design and implementation do not support the inclusion of a "Select all" button as an optional feature. This limitation prevents users from selecting all items across all pages, which is a requirement for handling large amounts of data efficiently.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users cannot perform actions on all pages of the data table at once.
**Cause**: Without a "Select all" button, users can only select items on the current page. This limitation hinders the ability to perform batch actions across multiple pages, which is necessary for managing large datasets effectively.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current design does not align with user expectations and common practices seen in other applications like Gmail.
**Cause**: The absence of a "Select all" button deviates from established design patterns and user interface conventions, leading to a less intuitive and user-friendly experience. Users familiar with similar features in other applications may find the current implementation confusing or limiting.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of a "Select all" button in the `TableBatchActions` component, which restricts users from selecting and performing actions on all items across multiple pages. This limitation stems from the current design and implementation of the component, which does not support this feature. Additionally, the absence of this button deviates from common design practices, potentially causing confusion and reducing user efficiency. To address these issues, the component should be updated to optionally include a "Select all" button, aligning with user expectations and enhancing the overall user experience.
