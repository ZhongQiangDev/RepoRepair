Let me analyze the problem and its causes based on the provided GitHub issue description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The TableBatchActions component currently lacks a "Select all" functionality that works across all pages of the data table.
**Cause**: The component was initially designed to only handle selections on the current page, without considering the need for bulk operations across all pages of data.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users cannot efficiently perform actions on large datasets that span multiple pages.
**Cause**: The current implementation only allows selection of items on the visible/current page, forcing users to manually navigate through pages to select items when they need to perform operations on the entire dataset.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user experience differs from common industry patterns.
**Cause**: Popular applications like Gmail provide a "Select all" feature for bulk operations, but this component doesn't follow this established pattern, creating an inconsistent experience for users who are familiar with similar interfaces.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: There's no clear visual indication or mechanism to distinguish between "current page selection" and "all pages selection".
**Cause**: The current UI design doesn't account for the two different selection modes (current page vs. all pages), making it difficult for users to understand the scope of their selections.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around the TableBatchActions component's limited selection capabilities, specifically its inability to handle selections across multiple pages. This limitation affects user efficiency when working with large datasets and deviates from established UX patterns. The problem stems from initial design decisions that didn't account for bulk operations across pages, lacking proper UI mechanisms to handle and display different selection modes, and not following common industry practices for data table interactions. The solution requires adding an optional "Select all" button that can handle cross-page selections while maintaining clear visual feedback about the selection scope.
