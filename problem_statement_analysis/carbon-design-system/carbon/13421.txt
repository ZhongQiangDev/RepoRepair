### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The application breaks when destructuring `DataTable` and its counterparts from `@carbon/react`.
**Cause**: The destructuring syntax used in the code is incorrect. When destructuring `DataTable`, the components inside it are not directly accessible as properties of `DataTable`. Instead, they should be imported directly from the package.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Console errors appear when using the incorrect destructuring syntax.
**Cause**: The React.createElement function expects a valid component type (either a string for built-in components or a class/function for composite components), but it receives `undefined` because the destructured components are not correctly imported.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The application works correctly when importing all components directly from `@carbon/react`.
**Cause**: This approach correctly imports the components as named exports from the package, ensuring they are available for use in the application.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect use of destructuring syntax when importing components from `@carbon/react`. The components should be imported directly as named exports from the package rather than being destructured from `DataTable`. This ensures that the components are correctly defined and available for use in the application, preventing console errors and application breaks. The suggested severity is Severity 1, as this issue prevents the application from functioning correctly and needs to be addressed promptly.
