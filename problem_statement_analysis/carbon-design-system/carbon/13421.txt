Let me analyze the problem and its causes based on the provided GitHub issue description and screenshots.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Application breaks when destructuring DataTable components from the DataTable import
**Cause**: The DataTable component from @carbon/react doesn't support destructuring of its subcomponents. The subcomponents are not actually properties of the DataTable component, but rather separate exports from the package.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple React createElement type invalid errors in console
**Cause**: When destructuring from DataTable, the subcomponents (TableContainer, Table, TableHead, etc.) become undefined, causing React to fail when trying to create elements with undefined component types. This is evidenced by the error messages showing "expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined."

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: DataTable component fails to render properly
**Cause**: The incorrect import pattern breaks the component hierarchy and relationships between the DataTable and its child components, preventing proper rendering of the table structure and data.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from an incorrect assumption about the @carbon/react package's export structure. The DataTable component is not designed to be destructured to access its subcomponents. Instead, these components need to be imported directly from @carbon/react as separate named imports. The incorrect usage leads to undefined components, React createElement errors, and a broken application state. The solution is to import all required components directly from @carbon/react using named imports:

```javascript
import {
  DataTable,
  TableContainer,
  Table,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
  TableHeader,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
} from '@carbon/react';
```

This ensures that all components are properly imported and maintain their intended relationships and functionality.
