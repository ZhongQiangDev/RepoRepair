### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Carbon list uses a smaller font size (14px) and line height (18px) compared to the proposed expressive list (16px font size and 24px line height).
**Cause**: The original Carbon list was designed for a different context, likely for more compact and dense content, whereas the expressive list is intended for a more readable and spacious layout suitable for productive experiences.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Carbon list uses `$body-short-01` for its text style, while the expressive list should use `$body-long-02`.
**Cause**: The `$body-short-01` style is optimized for short, concise text, whereas `$body-long-02` is better suited for longer text content, providing better readability and spacing.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The Carbon button has a smaller height (40px for medium and 32px for small) compared to the proposed expressive button (48px height).
**Cause**: The original Carbon button sizes were designed for a more compact interface, while the expressive button aims to provide a larger, more prominent and easier-to-click target, especially for users with accessibility needs.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The Carbon button uses a smaller font size (14px) compared to the proposed expressive button (16px).
**Cause**: The smaller font size in the original Carbon button was likely chosen for space efficiency, but the expressive button prioritizes readability and clarity, especially in contexts where the button text might be more prominent or contain longer labels.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues identified stem from the original Carbon components being designed for compact and dense content, which is not suitable for the more productive and readable experiences required by IBM.com. The proposed expressive list and button aim to address these limitations by providing larger font sizes, increased line heights, and more prominent visual elements, ensuring better readability and usability in various contexts across the IBM.com platform.
