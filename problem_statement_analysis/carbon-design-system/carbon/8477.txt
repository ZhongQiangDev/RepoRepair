Let me analyze the issues and their causes based on the provided GitHub problem description and images.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The current "expressive theme" approach doesn't suit many IBM.com productive experiences
**Cause**: The original assumption that IBM.com primarily serves long-form reading and marketing content was incorrect. Many sections require productive experiences with smaller type sizes (14px) and compact components.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent typography and spacing in lists across different sections
**Cause**: The current implementation uses different text sizes and line heights:
- Digital version: body-long-02 (16px/1.5)
- Carbon version: body-short-01 (14px/.875)
This creates inconsistency in the user experience.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Button size variations lack standardization
**Cause**: Multiple button sizes exist without clear guidelines:
- Digital version: 48px height with 20px spacing
- Carbon version: Various sizes (48px, 40px, 32px) with different spacing rules
This leads to inconsistent button implementations across the platform.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Fragmented component system requiring maintenance of two themes
**Cause**: The separate "expressive theme" creates additional overhead in maintaining two different design systems, making it harder to ensure consistency and manage updates.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from an incorrect initial assumption about IBM.com's primary use case, leading to:
1. A misaligned expressive theme that doesn't serve productive experiences
2. Inconsistent typography and spacing systems between different implementations
3. Lack of standardization in component sizes and spacing
4. Increased maintenance complexity due to parallel theme systems

The proposed solution to add specific expressive tokens and components to Carbon 10 while deprecating the separate "expressive theme" would help address these issues by:
- Providing necessary larger components when needed
- Maintaining consistency through a single design system
- Reducing maintenance overhead
- Better supporting both expressive and productive use cases
