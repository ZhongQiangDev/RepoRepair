### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The React `<ComboBox>` selection element is including multiselect styles, which makes it appear broken.
**Cause**: The `<ComboBox>` component might be incorrectly configured or styled to include multiselect styles when it should not. This could be due to incorrect props being passed to the component, or a CSS class being applied that is meant for a multiselect component instead of a single-select one.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The invalid state selection icon is positioned incorrectly.
**Cause**: The CSS for the invalid state selection icon might be misaligned due to incorrect margin, padding, or positioning properties. This could also be caused by a conflicting CSS rule from another part of the application that is affecting the icon's position.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual appearance of the `<ComboBox>` is inconsistent with the expected design.
**Cause**: There might be a mismatch between the expected design and the actual implementation. This could be due to outdated or incorrect CSS styles being applied, or the component not being updated to reflect the latest design changes.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues with the React `<ComboBox>` selection element can be attributed to incorrect styling and configuration. The inclusion of multiselect styles when they should not be present, the incorrect positioning of the invalid state selection icon, and the overall inconsistent appearance are all symptoms of these underlying causes. Addressing these issues will likely involve reviewing the component's props, CSS styles, and ensuring that the implementation matches the expected design.
