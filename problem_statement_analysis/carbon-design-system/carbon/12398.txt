### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The checkbox does not visually indicate a read-only state.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks a distinct visual style for the read-only state, making it indistinguishable from other states like disabled or selected.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The checkbox does not have a prop for read-only functionality.
**Cause**: The component is missing a prop that allows developers to set the checkbox to a read-only state, which is necessary for controlling its behavior in different use cases.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There are no controls for each state in the playground.
**Cause**: The playground lacks interactive controls to demonstrate the checkbox in various states, including read-only, which is essential for developers to understand and test the component's behavior.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no default story for easy copy and paste.
**Cause**: The absence of a default story makes it difficult for developers to quickly integrate and use the checkbox component, as they would need to manually set up the component each time.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop are missing.
**Cause**: The component lacks Right-to-Left (RTL) tests, which are necessary to ensure that the read-only state functions correctly in languages that read from right to left, potentially leading to layout or functionality issues in such contexts.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The checkbox component needs improvements in visual indication for the read-only state, addition of a read-only prop, inclusion of controls for each state in the playground, creation of a default story for easy integration, and implementation of RTL tests for the read-only class. Addressing these issues will enhance the component's usability, accessibility, and compatibility across different use cases and languages.
