Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the issues and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing read-only state implementation in the checkbox component
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't include a read-only state property and its associated styles, as shown in the acceptance criteria and design specifications

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of playground controls for different checkbox states
**Cause**: The component needs controls to demonstrate and test various states (enabled, disabled, read-only) but these are not implemented yet

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing RTL (Right-to-Left) testing support
**Cause**: The component lacks proper test coverage for RTL scenarios and the read-only class property

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: No default story implementation
**Cause**: The component is missing a default story implementation that would allow easy copy-paste functionality for developers

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Component not properly located in package structure
**Cause**: The checkbox component needs to be coded in '/package/react' but may not be in the correct location based on the acceptance criteria checkbox being unchecked

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around incomplete implementation of the checkbox component, specifically:
1. Missing read-only state functionality and styling
2. Lack of proper testing infrastructure (RTL)
3. Absence of playground controls for state demonstration
4. Missing default story implementation
5. Incorrect component location in package structure

These issues need to be addressed to meet the acceptance criteria and provide a fully functional, well-tested checkbox component with proper documentation and examples.
