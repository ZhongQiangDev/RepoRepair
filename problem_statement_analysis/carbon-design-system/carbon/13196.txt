### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `hideLabel` prop does not hide the label as expected when set to `true` without the `aria-labelledby` prop.
**Cause**: The implementation of the `hideLabel` prop is dependent on the `aria-labelledby` prop. Without `aria-labelledby`, the `hideLabel` prop does not trigger the expected behavior of hiding the label.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The documentation for `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` is unclear.
**Cause**: The current documentation does not clearly state that `aria-labelledby` is required for `hideLabel` to work as intended. This lack of clarity leads to confusion and incorrect usage.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `hideLabel` prop does not support the `for` attribute on the label for A11Y compliance.
**Cause**: The implementation of `hideLabel` is tied specifically to the `aria-labelledby` prop, which does not account for the `for` attribute on the label. This limitation restricts the flexibility and accessibility of the component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are the dependency of `hideLabel` on `aria-labelledby`, unclear documentation, and the lack of support for the `for` attribute. To resolve these issues, the implementation of `hideLabel` should be revised to work independently of `aria-labelledby`, the documentation should be updated to clearly explain the requirements and behavior, and the component should be modified to support the `for` attribute for better A11Y compliance.
