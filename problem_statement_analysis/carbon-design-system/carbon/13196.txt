Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `hideLabel` prop behavior is not intuitive - setting `hideLabel={true}` moves the label to the side instead of hiding it completely
**Cause**: The component's implementation treats `hideLabel` as a layout control property rather than a visibility control property, which is contrary to what developers would expect from the prop name

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `hideLabel` prop requires `aria-labelledby` to be set in order to completely hide the label
**Cause**: The component has a tight coupling between the `hideLabel` functionality and the `aria-labelledby` prop, making the hiding behavior dependent on an accessibility attribute that should be optional

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor documentation of the `hideLabel` prop and its relationship with `aria-labelledby`
**Cause**: The component's documentation doesn't clearly explain:
1. The actual behavior of `hideLabel`
2. The requirement to use `aria-labelledby` for complete label hiding
3. The different label positioning behaviors (side vs top)

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of support for alternative accessibility approaches like the HTML `for` attribute
**Cause**: The component's design enforces the use of `aria-labelledby` while not supporting other standard HTML accessibility patterns like the `for` attribute, which limits flexibility and creates unnecessary restrictions

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Toggle component has several issues centered around its label handling:
1. Unintuitive and misleading behavior of the `hideLabel` prop
2. Unnecessary dependency between label hiding and `aria-labelledby`
3. Insufficient documentation of the actual behavior
4. Limited accessibility implementation that doesn't support standard HTML patterns

These issues make the component harder to use than necessary and create confusion for developers. The component needs both implementation changes to make it more intuitive and flexible, as well as better documentation to clearly explain its behavior.
