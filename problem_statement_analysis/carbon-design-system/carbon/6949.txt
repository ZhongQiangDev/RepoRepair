### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The labels in the Pagination component display as `NaN` when the `All` option is selected.
**Cause**: The `pageSizes` prop currently only accepts numerical values. When a non-numeric value like `All` is provided, the component attempts to perform numerical operations on it, resulting in `NaN` (Not a Number).

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The developer cannot define custom text for the values in the `pageSizes` list.
**Cause**: The `pageSizes` prop is designed to accept an array of numbers, not an array of objects with `value` and `text` properties. This limitation prevents the developer from specifying custom labels for each page size option.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `All` option does not display the correct number of items when selected.
**Cause**: The `pageSizes` prop does not support dynamic values like `totalItems`. When `totalItems` is used as a value, it is not properly recognized by the component, leading to incorrect display and functionality.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the current limitations of the `pageSizes` prop, which only accepts numerical values and does not support custom labels or dynamic values. To resolve these issues, the component should be updated to accept an array of objects with `value` and `text` properties, allowing developers to define custom labels and handle dynamic values like `totalItems` appropriately. This would ensure that the `All` option displays the correct number of items and prevents `NaN` labels from appearing in the Pagination component.
