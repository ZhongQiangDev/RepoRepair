### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The id identifier specified for WAI-ARIA property `aria-owns` and `aria-controls` on the element is not valid.
**Cause**: The `aria-owns` and `aria-controls` attributes are pointing to an id (`carbon-dropdown-example__menu`) that does not exist in the DOM. This can happen if the id is misspelled, the element with the specified id is not rendered, or the id is dynamically generated and not correctly assigned.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The accessible name does not contain the visible label text.
**Cause**: The `aria-label` attribute on the button element is set to "open menu," which does not match the visible text "This is not a dropdown title." This discrepancy can confuse screen reader users, as the accessible name should accurately reflect the visible text to ensure proper context and usability.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The React Dropdown component has two main accessibility issues. The first issue is related to invalid WAI-ARIA attributes (`aria-owns` and `aria-controls`) that reference a non-existent id, which can be fixed by ensuring the id is correctly assigned and exists in the DOM. The second issue is the mismatch between the `aria-label` and the visible label text, which can be resolved by updating the `aria-label` to match the visible text or by using `aria-labelledby` to reference the label element directly. Addressing these issues will improve the accessibility and usability of the dropdown component for users relying on assistive technologies.
