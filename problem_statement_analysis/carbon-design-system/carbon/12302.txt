### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The page number is displayed twice when `pagesUnknown` is set to `true`.
**Cause**: The pagination component is rendering both the selected page number from the dropdown and the text "page X" simultaneously. This redundancy is likely due to the component's logic not properly handling the `pagesUnknown` prop, causing it to display both elements without checking if they are necessary.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The design of the pagination component appears inconsistent when `pagesUnknown` is `true`.
**Cause**: The component's design may not have been updated to accommodate the `pagesUnknown` prop. This could be due to a lack of conditional rendering logic that hides or modifies the display of the page number text when the prop is set to `true`.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user experience is negatively impacted by the redundant information.
**Cause**: The current implementation does not prioritize user experience when `pagesUnknown` is `true`. The redundant display of the page number can confuse users and make the interface less intuitive.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the redundant display of the page number when `pagesUnknown` is set to `true`. This is caused by a lack of proper conditional rendering logic in the component, leading to both the dropdown selection and the text "page X" being displayed simultaneously. This results in an inconsistent design and a suboptimal user experience. To resolve this, the component should be updated to conditionally render the page number text based on the value of the `pagesUnknown` prop.
