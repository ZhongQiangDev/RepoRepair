### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The alignment of the labels in the `tall` data table headers is misaligned when sorting is enabled.
**Cause**: The CSS styles applied to the sortable column header might not be consistent with the styles applied to the non-sortable column headers. This inconsistency can cause the labels in the sortable column to be misaligned compared to the other column headers.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The first column is the only one that is sortable, and its label alignment is different from the other columns.
**Cause**: The `size` property of the DataTable is set to `tall`, which might affect the layout and alignment of the column headers. The sortable column header might have additional padding or margin that is not applied to the other column headers, causing the alignment issue.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The alignment issue becomes more noticeable when the row height is changed.
**Cause**: Changing the row height can affect the overall layout of the table, including the alignment of the column headers. If the styles for the sortable column header are not responsive to changes in row height, it can cause the alignment issue to become more pronounced.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The alignment issue in the `tall` data table headers is caused by inconsistent CSS styles applied to the sortable column header compared to the non-sortable column headers. The `size` property of the DataTable and changes in row height can exacerbate the alignment issue. To fix this problem, the styles for the sortable column header should be updated to ensure consistent alignment with the other column headers, regardless of the `size` property or row height.
