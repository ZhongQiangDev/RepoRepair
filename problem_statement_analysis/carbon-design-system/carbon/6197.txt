Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided screenshot, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent vertical alignment of header labels in the data table when the size is set to 'tall'
**Cause**: The sorting functionality adds additional elements (sort icons/controls) to sortable columns, which affects the vertical alignment calculation. The CSS layout rules aren't properly handling the additional height created by these sort controls in 'tall' mode.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Misaligned header content between sortable and non-sortable columns
**Cause**: The header cells have different internal structures - sortable columns contain both the label and sort controls, while non-sortable columns only contain the label. Without proper CSS alignment rules to account for these differences, the content appears at different vertical positions.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent padding/spacing in header cells
**Cause**: The 'tall' size property likely increases the row height without properly adjusting the internal padding and alignment properties of the header cells, particularly for cells with sorting functionality.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper CSS handling of the data table's header cells when in 'tall' mode, particularly when mixing sortable and non-sortable columns. The presence of sort controls in some columns but not others creates inconsistent internal structures that aren't properly aligned. The issue becomes more pronounced in 'tall' mode because the increased height magnifies these alignment discrepancies. To fix this, the component needs better CSS rules to maintain consistent vertical alignment regardless of the presence of sort controls and the table's size setting.
