Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided image, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Long text in code snippet doesn't wrap to multiple lines
**Cause**: The code snippet component likely has the CSS property `white-space: nowrap` set by default, which prevents text from wrapping regardless of the container width

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Setting type="multi" attribute doesn't enable text wrapping
**Cause**: The type="multi" attribute may only control the visual appearance or height of the component, but doesn't override the underlying text wrapping behavior controlled by CSS

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Setting height property doesn't resolve the text overflow
**Cause**: Height property only controls the vertical dimension of the container, but has no effect on horizontal text wrapping behavior

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: No built-in way to determine or limit the number of displayed columns
**Cause**: The component lacks configuration options for:
1. Maximum width or column limit
2. API/method to report the current display width
3. Text normalization capabilities

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from the code snippet component's default CSS styling that prevents text wrapping. The attempted solutions (type="multi" and height adjustment) don't address the core CSS behavior. Additionally, the component lacks built-in functionality for width control and column reporting. To fix these issues, the component needs:
1. CSS modifications to enable text wrapping
2. Width control parameters
3. API for reporting display dimensions
4. Text normalization capabilities

The most immediate solution would be to modify the CSS to allow text wrapping while maintaining the code snippet's formatting and appearance.
