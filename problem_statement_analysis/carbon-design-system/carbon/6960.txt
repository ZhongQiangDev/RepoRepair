### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The long single line of text (CRN) in the code snippet does not break into multiple lines, even when `type="multi"` is used.
**Cause**: The `type="multi"` attribute may not be sufficient to enable text wrapping in the code snippet. The code snippet's CSS properties, such as `white-space`, might be set to `nowrap`, preventing the text from wrapping. Additionally, the container's width might not be properly defined, causing the text to overflow instead of wrapping.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Setting the `height` attribute does not help in breaking the long line of text into multiple lines.
**Cause**: The `height` attribute only controls the vertical space of the container but does not influence text wrapping. Text wrapping is controlled by CSS properties like `white-space`, `word-wrap`, or `overflow-wrap`. If these properties are not set correctly, the text will not wrap, regardless of the container's height.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no built-in way to report the number of columns displayed or to set a maximum size for the text within the code snippet.
**Cause**: The code snippet component may lack built-in functionality to dynamically report the number of columns displayed or to enforce a maximum size. This would require additional JavaScript or CSS to measure the text width and adjust the display accordingly. Without such functionality, the text may overflow or not wrap as expected.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues are related to text wrapping and container sizing. The `type="multi"` attribute and `height` setting are insufficient for enabling text wrapping, likely due to CSS properties that prevent wrapping. Additionally, the code snippet lacks built-in functionality to report the number of columns or enforce a maximum size, requiring custom JavaScript or CSS solutions. To resolve these issues, the CSS properties for text wrapping should be adjusted, and custom functionality should be added to handle column reporting and maximum size enforcement.
