### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Two tooltips are visible and overlapping each other when hovering over another icon-only button while one is already focused.
**Cause**: The current implementation does not handle the tooltip visibility correctly when the focus shifts from one button to another. Specifically, the tooltip for the focused button remains visible even when the mouse hovers over another button, leading to overlapping tooltips.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tooltip for the focused button does not disappear when the user hovers over a different icon-only button.
**Cause**: The tooltip visibility logic does not account for the hover state of other buttons. The tooltip for the focused button should be hidden when the user hovers over another button to prevent overlapping tooltips.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The tooltip for the focused button is shown even when it is not necessary for accessibility.
**Cause**: The tooltip for the focused button might be redundant since the use of `aria-label` should be sufficient for accessibility purposes. This redundancy can lead to unnecessary visual clutter, especially when multiple tooltips are displayed simultaneously.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect handling of tooltip visibility when the focus shifts between icon-only buttons. The tooltips for focused buttons remain visible even when the user hovers over other buttons, leading to overlapping tooltips. This can be addressed by updating the tooltip visibility logic to hide the tooltip of the focused button when another button is hovered. Additionally, the necessity of showing tooltips for focused buttons should be reconsidered, as `aria-label` can provide sufficient accessibility support.
