Let me analyze the GitHub problem description and identify the issues and their causes.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing read-only state implementation for dropdown component
**Cause**: The current dropdown component doesn't have a read-only state implementation in the `/package/react` directory, which is needed according to the acceptance criteria.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of visual feedback for read-only state
**Cause**: The design system doesn't show specific styles or visual indicators for the read-only state in the dropdown component, making it unclear to users when the dropdown is in a read-only state.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing playground controls for different states
**Cause**: The component doesn't have controls in the playground to demonstrate and test different states (including the read-only state), making it difficult for developers to test and verify the component's behavior.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Absence of RTL (Right-to-Left) testing
**Cause**: No RTL tests have been implemented to verify the read-only class functionality, which is required for proper internationalization support.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: No default story implementation
**Cause**: The component lacks a default story implementation that would allow developers to easily copy and paste the component with its basic configuration, making it less convenient to use in new implementations.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around incomplete implementation of the dropdown component's read-only functionality. The problems include:
1. Missing core read-only state implementation
2. Lack of visual styling for read-only state
3. Absence of playground controls for testing
4. Missing RTL testing support
5. No default story implementation for easy reuse

These issues need to be addressed to create a fully functional and accessible read-only dropdown component that meets all the acceptance criteria. The implementation should focus on both the functional aspects (code implementation, testing) and the user experience (visual feedback, proper state handling).
