### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The read-only dropdown does not visually differentiate itself from an editable dropdown.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks specific styles for the read-only state, such as a different background color, border style, or text color, which would indicate that the dropdown is not editable.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The read-only dropdown does not have a prop to control its read-only state.
**Cause**: The component is missing a prop that allows developers to set the dropdown to a read-only mode. This prop is necessary to toggle the read-only functionality and apply the corresponding styles.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There are no controls for each state in the playground.
**Cause**: The playground environment lacks interactive controls to demonstrate the read-only state alongside other states (e.g., default, error, filled). This makes it difficult for developers to test and understand the behavior of the read-only dropdown.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no default story for easy copy and paste.
**Cause**: The absence of a default story in the documentation or storybook means that developers do not have a quick and easy way to integrate the read-only dropdown into their projects. This can lead to inconsistencies in implementation.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop are missing.
**Cause**: The implementation does not include Right-to-Left (RTL) tests, which are essential for ensuring that the read-only dropdown functions correctly in languages that read from right to left. This can result in layout or usability issues in RTL environments.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues with the read-only dropdown implementation include a lack of visual differentiation for the read-only state, missing props and controls for state management, the absence of a default story for easy integration, and a lack of RTL testing. Addressing these issues will improve the usability, accessibility, and developer experience of the read-only dropdown component.
