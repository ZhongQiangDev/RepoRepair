Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided GIF, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: VoiceOver announces each tab as "1 of 1" instead of indicating the correct position (e.g., "2 of 4" for the second tab in a group of four tabs)
**Cause**: The ARIA attributes for managing tab positions and total count are likely missing or incorrectly implemented in the Carbon Design System's Tab component. The component should include proper `aria-posinset` (position in set) and `aria-setsize` (total number of items in set) attributes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tab component fails to provide proper context about the tab group structure to screen readers
**Cause**: The tab component might be missing proper ARIA roles and relationships. It should have:
- A container element with `role="tablist"`
- Each tab should have `role="tab"`
- Proper `aria-controls` attributes linking tabs to their respective panels
- Correct implementation of `aria-selected` state

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The accessibility information doesn't match the visual representation of the interface
**Cause**: There's a disconnect between the visual UI and its accessibility tree representation. The component's DOM structure might not be properly organized to reflect the semantic relationship between tabs, which affects how assistive technologies interpret and announce the interface.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from incomplete accessibility implementation in the Carbon Design System's Tab component. The main problems are:
1. Missing or incorrect ARIA attributes for position and total count
2. Incomplete implementation of ARIA roles and relationships
3. Misalignment between visual and accessibility representations

To fix these issues, the component needs to be updated with proper ARIA attributes and roles to correctly communicate the tab structure and positions to assistive technologies like VoiceOver. This would ensure that users receive accurate information about their location within the tab group while navigating.
