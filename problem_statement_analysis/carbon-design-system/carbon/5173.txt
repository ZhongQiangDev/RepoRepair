### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: VoiceOver always announces the current tab as "1 of 1" instead of announcing the correct position and total number of tabs in the group.
**Cause**: The ARIA attributes for the tab elements might not be correctly set up to convey the total number of tabs and the current tab's position. Specifically, the `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` attributes, which are used to indicate the position of an element within a set and the size of the set, respectively, may not be properly implemented or updated when the tab group is rendered or when the user navigates between tabs.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The tab navigation does not provide the expected feedback indicating the total number of tabs and the current tab's position within the group.
**Cause**: The JavaScript or React component responsible for managing the tab group might not be updating the ARIA attributes dynamically as the user interacts with the tabs. This could be due to a missing or incorrect event handler that fails to update the `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` attributes when the tab selection changes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The VoiceOver screen reader does not announce the correct tab navigation information.
**Cause**: There could be a compatibility issue between the version of VoiceOver being used and the ARIA attributes implemented in the Carbon Design System. The specific combination of macOS version, Chrome version, and VoiceOver version might not fully support or correctly interpret the ARIA attributes used for tab navigation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that VoiceOver is not announcing the correct tab navigation information, specifically the position and total number of tabs. This is likely due to incorrect or missing ARIA attributes (`aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize`) in the tab elements, a failure to dynamically update these attributes as the user navigates, or a compatibility issue with the specific versions of the operating system, browser, and screen reader being used. Addressing these issues by ensuring proper ARIA attribute implementation and dynamic updates should resolve the problem.
