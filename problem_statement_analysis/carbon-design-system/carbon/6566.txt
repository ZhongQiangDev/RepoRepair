### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination is overflowing its container on smaller viewports.
**Cause**: The pagination component does not have a responsive design that adjusts its layout or size based on the viewport width. When the container is smaller, the pagination elements do not wrap or become scrollable, causing them to overflow.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination is not scrollable when it overflows its container.
**Cause**: The container holding the pagination does not have the appropriate CSS properties set to enable scrolling when the content overflows. Specifically, the `overflow-x` property is not set to `auto` or `scroll`, which would allow horizontal scrolling when the content exceeds the container's width.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination layout does not adapt to smaller viewports.
**Cause**: The CSS media queries or flexbox/grid properties used in the pagination component are not configured to handle smaller screen sizes effectively. This results in the pagination elements not resizing or repositioning themselves to fit within the container on smaller viewports.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the lack of responsive design in the pagination component, the absence of scrollable behavior when content overflows, and the inadequate handling of smaller viewports. To fix these issues, the pagination component should be updated to include responsive design principles, ensure the container has the correct `overflow-x` property for scrolling, and adjust the layout using media queries or flexbox/grid properties to adapt to smaller screen sizes.
