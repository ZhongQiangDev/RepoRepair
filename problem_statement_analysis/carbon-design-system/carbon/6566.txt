Let me analyze the pagination overflow issue based on the provided information and screenshots:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination component overflows its container on smaller viewports (when viewport width is above 42rem)
**Cause**: The CSS overflow property is set to "visible" for viewport widths above 42rem, which prevents the container from properly containing the pagination elements

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No horizontal scrolling capability when pagination overflows
**Cause**: Missing proper CSS overflow handling (like overflow-x: auto) to enable horizontal scrolling when content exceeds container width

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Pagination controls (page selector, items per page dropdown) don't adjust/wrap responsively
**Cause**: Lack of responsive design implementation for the pagination component's layout - elements maintain fixed positions instead of adapting to available space

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: No mobile-friendly alternative view for smaller screens
**Cause**: Missing breakpoint-specific styling or alternative component layout for mobile/smaller viewport sizes

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The pagination overflow issue stems from several related problems in the component's design and implementation:
1. Improper overflow handling above 42rem viewport width
2. Missing horizontal scroll functionality
3. Non-responsive layout of pagination controls
4. Lack of mobile-friendly alternative views

The main fix would require:
- Implementing proper overflow handling
- Adding responsive design patterns
- Creating mobile-friendly layouts
- Ensuring pagination controls can wrap or resize based on available space

These changes would need to be implemented in the carbon-components-react package to resolve the overflow issues while maintaining functionality across all viewport sizes.
