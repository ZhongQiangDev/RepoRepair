### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `$link-inverse-active` token uses the same color for both White and Gray 10 backgrounds.
**Cause**: The current design does not differentiate between the White and Gray 10 backgrounds for the `$link-inverse-active` token, leading to a lack of visual distinction and potentially reducing readability.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `$link-inverse-hover` token uses the same color for both White and Gray 10 backgrounds.
**Cause**: Similar to the `$link-inverse-active` token, the `$link-inverse-hover` token does not provide a distinct color for the White and Gray 10 backgrounds, which can result in poor contrast and reduced user experience.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `$link-inverse-active` token uses Gray 100 for both Gray 90 and Gray 100 backgrounds.
**Cause**: Using the same color for both Gray 90 and Gray 100 backgrounds can lead to a lack of visual contrast, making it difficult for users to distinguish between the two states.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The `$link-inverse-hover` token uses Blue 70 for both Gray 90 and Gray 100 backgrounds.
**Cause**: The use of the same color for both Gray 90 and Gray 100 backgrounds can result in poor contrast and reduced readability, especially for users with visual impairments.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the lack of distinct colors for different background types and the use of the same color for multiple background states. These behaviors can lead to poor contrast, reduced readability, and a suboptimal user experience. To address these issues, it is necessary to define unique colors for each background type and state, ensuring adequate contrast and visual distinction.
