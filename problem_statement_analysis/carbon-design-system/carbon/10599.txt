Let me analyze the issues and their causes based on the provided GitHub problem description and image.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent token naming convention between the table and implementation
**Cause**: In the table, the token is named `$link-inverse-active`, but in the implementation image, it's shown as `$link-active-inverse`. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and implementation errors.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Unclear token choice for active state
**Cause**: The implementation shows uncertainty between using `$link-active-inverse` or `$text-primary-inverse` for the active state (indicated by the "or" statement and question mark), suggesting a lack of clear design system guidelines for this use case.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Color value discrepancy for dark theme active state
**Cause**: The table specifies Gray 100 for dark theme (Gray 90 and Gray 100 columns), but the implementation shows #161616 (which is a different shade) for the active state in dark theme.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing token definition for base/default state
**Cause**: While hover and active states are defined, there's no clear definition for the default/base state of `$link-inverse`, which is necessary for a complete interactive token set.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around inconsistent naming conventions between documentation and implementation, unclear token choices for active states, color value mismatches in the dark theme, and incomplete token definitions. These issues suggest a need for:
1. Standardizing token naming conventions
2. Clearly defining the token hierarchy and usage guidelines
3. Ensuring color values are consistent across documentation and implementation
4. Completing the token set with all necessary states (default, hover, active)

These improvements would help create a more robust and maintainable design system.
