### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `required` attribute has to be specified on every `RadioTile` instead of on the `TileGroup`.
**Cause**: The current implementation of `RadioTile` does not support inheriting the `required` attribute from its parent `TileGroup`. This means that each `RadioTile` must be individually marked as `required` for native form validation to work correctly. This is not only redundant but also increases the complexity of managing the form's validation logic.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The invisible underlying input is not positioned correctly to display validation errors at a suitable location.
**Cause**: The CSS positioning of the underlying input element is not correctly configured. The input element, which is responsible for triggering the native validation message, is not aligned properly with the `RadioTile`. This results in the validation message appearing in an incorrect location, such as at the top of the form or in an unexpected area, rather than near the `RadioTile` where the user interaction occurs.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The validation message is not displayed in a user-friendly manner.
**Cause**: The current CSS for the `.bx--tile-input` class does not position the validation message in a way that is intuitive for users. The message should ideally appear near the `RadioTile` that requires user input, but due to the incorrect positioning, it appears elsewhere, which can confuse users and make it unclear which field needs attention.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the redundancy in specifying the `required` attribute on each `RadioTile` and the incorrect positioning of the underlying input element, which affects the display of validation messages. These issues stem from the current implementation's lack of support for inheriting attributes and improper CSS positioning. Addressing these causes would involve updating the component logic to allow attribute inheritance and refining the CSS to ensure the validation message is displayed in a user-friendly location.
