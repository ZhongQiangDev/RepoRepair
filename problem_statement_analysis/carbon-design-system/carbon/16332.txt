### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency in the naming of the `ariaLabel` prop across different Carbon components. Some components accept `ariaLabel` while others accept `aria-label`.
**Cause**: The inconsistency arises from the lack of a standardized approach in the Carbon components library. Some components were likely developed or updated at different times, leading to variations in prop naming conventions. Additionally, the React documentation recommends using kebab-case (`aria-label`) for ARIA attributes, but this guideline may not have been consistently followed during the development of the components.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The Storybook documentation for some components shows `ariaLabel` while the actual implementation may accept `aria-label`.
**Cause**: The Storybook documentation may not have been updated to reflect the actual implementation of the components. This discrepancy can occur if the documentation is not maintained in sync with the codebase, leading to confusion for developers who rely on the documentation for guidance.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Some components only accept one of `ariaLabel` or `aria-label` and not both, leading to potential issues with backward compatibility.
**Cause**: The components may have been developed with a specific prop naming convention in mind, and the developers may not have considered the need for supporting both naming conventions. This can result in breaking changes for developers who are using the components with the unsupported prop name.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified are inconsistency in prop naming, discrepancies between documentation and implementation, and lack of backward compatibility. These issues can be addressed by standardizing the prop naming convention across all components, ensuring that the documentation is up-to-date with the actual implementation, and supporting both naming conventions during a transition period to maintain backward compatibility. The recommended approach is to refactor the components to use `aria-label` as per React's official guidelines and deprecate the use of `ariaLabel` to ensure consistency and adherence to best practices.
