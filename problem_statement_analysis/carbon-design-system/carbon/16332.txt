Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent prop naming across Carbon components - some components use `ariaLabel` while others use `aria-label`
**Cause**: Lack of standardization in the implementation of accessibility attributes across different components in the Carbon Design System. This has led to some components following camelCase naming (ariaLabel) while others follow kebab-case naming (aria-label).

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Some components accept both `ariaLabel` and `aria-label` props while others only accept one format
**Cause**: Incremental updates and changes to components over time without a comprehensive standardization effort, resulting in inconsistent prop support across the component library.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Non-compliance with React's official WAI-ARIA guidelines
**Cause**: React's official documentation specifically recommends using kebab-case (hyphen-case) for ARIA attributes to match HTML standards, but some Carbon components are using camelCase instead.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Storybook documentation shows different prop names compared to what's actually supported in the source code
**Cause**: Documentation and implementation misalignment, possibly due to updates in one place not being reflected in the other, leading to confusion for developers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from inconsistent implementation of accessibility attributes across the Carbon component library. The problems manifest in four main areas: inconsistent prop naming conventions, inconsistent prop support, non-compliance with React's WAI-ARIA guidelines, and documentation-implementation mismatches. The solution, as outlined in the plan of action, is to standardize all components to use the `aria-label` prop format, following React's official guidelines, while maintaining backward compatibility through a deprecation process for the `ariaLabel` prop. This needs to be implemented across 13 identified components to ensure consistency throughout the library.
