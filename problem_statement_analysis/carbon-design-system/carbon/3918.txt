### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `OverflowMenu` inside the `DataTable` does not visually indicate which `OverflowMenuItem` is currently active when navigating with arrow keys.
**Cause**: The `OverflowMenu` component inside the `DataTable` lacks the necessary CSS styles or JavaScript logic to apply visual focus indicators when the menu items are navigated using the keyboard. This could be due to the styles not being properly applied or overridden by the `DataTable` styles.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `OverflowMenu` inside the `DataTable` does not allow users to select an `OverflowMenuItem` using the keyboard.
**Cause**: The `OverflowMenu` component inside the `DataTable` may not be properly handling keyboard events. This could be due to event listeners not being correctly attached or the event propagation being blocked by the `DataTable` component.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `OverflowMenu` inside the `DataTable` does not behave the same way as a standalone `OverflowMenu`.
**Cause**: The `OverflowMenu` component inside the `DataTable` may be inheriting styles or behaviors from the `DataTable` that interfere with its normal functionality. This could be due to conflicting CSS styles or JavaScript logic.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are the lack of visual focus indicators and the inability to select menu items using the keyboard. These problems are likely caused by missing or conflicting styles and event handling logic. To resolve these issues, the `OverflowMenu` component inside the `DataTable` needs to have the appropriate styles and event listeners applied to ensure consistent behavior with a standalone `OverflowMenu`.
