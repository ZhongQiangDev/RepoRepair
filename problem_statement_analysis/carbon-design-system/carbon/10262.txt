### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `TooltipDefinition` component currently only accepts `string` values for the `children` prop, which causes console warnings when other types like `h3` or `p` are used.
**Cause**: The `PropTypes` for the `children` prop is set to `PropTypes.string`, which restricts the component to only accept string values. This limitation prevents the component from rendering other types of React nodes, such as HTML elements or other components, without generating a warning.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Wrapping the `TooltipDefinition` component inside another HTML element like `h3` does not work as expected.
**Cause**: The `TooltipDefinition` component is rendered as a button, which means it cannot be nested inside certain HTML elements like `h3` due to HTML structure and semantic rules. This causes the tooltip to not display correctly or at all when placed inside such elements.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `TooltipDefinition` component is currently limited to accepting only string values for the `children` prop, which causes console warnings and prevents it from being used with other types of React nodes. Additionally, the component's rendering as a button restricts its placement within certain HTML elements. To resolve these issues, the `PropTypes` for the `children` prop should be changed to `PropTypes.node`, allowing the component to accept a wider range of values. Furthermore, the component's rendering logic may need to be adjusted to ensure it can be used more flexibly within different HTML structures.
