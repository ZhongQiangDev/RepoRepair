Based on the GitHub issue and provided design specifications, I'll analyze the problems and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing read-only state implementation in the NumberInput component
**Cause**: The component currently lacks a read-only prop and associated styles to handle read-only state, as evidenced by it not being included in the design specifications shown

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No RTL (Right-to-Left) testing support
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria mentions RTL tests are needed but currently missing, which is important for ensuring the component works correctly in right-to-left languages

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of playground controls for different states
**Cause**: The design shows different states (small, medium, large) but there's no implementation of controls in the playground to toggle between these states

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing default story implementation
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria indicates a need for a default story for easy copy-paste functionality, which is currently not implemented in the component

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Component not properly located in package structure
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria specifies the component should be in '/package/react' but it's either missing or not correctly placed in this location

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The NumberInput component requires several key implementations:
1. A read-only state implementation with appropriate styling
2. RTL testing support for internationalization
3. Playground controls for state management
4. Default story implementation for easy reuse
5. Proper component placement in the package structure

These issues primarily stem from incomplete implementation of the component's features and testing infrastructure. The design specifications are clear, but the actual implementation needs to be aligned with these requirements.
