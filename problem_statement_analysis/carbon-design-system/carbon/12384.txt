### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The read-only input does not visually differentiate itself from an editable input.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks a specific style or visual cue for the read-only state, making it indistinguishable from an editable input. This can confuse users who may attempt to interact with it as if it were editable.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The read-only input does not have a dedicated prop to control its state.
**Cause**: The component lacks a prop specifically designed to toggle the read-only functionality. Without this prop, developers cannot easily switch the input between editable and read-only modes, leading to inconsistent behavior across different use cases.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The playground lacks controls for testing the read-only state.
**Cause**: The absence of controls in the playground environment means developers cannot easily test the read-only functionality. This can result in bugs and inconsistencies when the component is used in a real-world application.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no default story provided for easy copy and paste.
**Cause**: Without a default story, developers must manually create their own examples, which can lead to inconsistencies and errors. A default story would provide a standardized example that developers can easily copy and paste into their projects.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop are missing.
**Cause**: The lack of RTL (Right-to-Left) tests means that the component may not function correctly in languages that read from right to left. This can result in layout and usability issues for users in these regions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The NumberInput component requires several improvements to ensure it functions correctly in read-only mode. These include adding specific styles for the read-only state, implementing a dedicated prop to control the state, providing controls in the playground for testing, creating a default story for easy integration, and conducting RTL tests to ensure compatibility with right-to-left languages. Addressing these issues will enhance the usability and reliability of the component across different use cases and languages.
