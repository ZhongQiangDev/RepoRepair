### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Storybook emits a warning for an invalid prop type when the `kind` prop is set to `danger-ghost` for the Button component.
**Cause**: The `kind` prop type validation in the Button component does not include `danger-ghost` as a valid value. The expected values are `["primary", "secondary", "danger", "ghost", "danger--primary", "danger--tertiary", "danger-tertiary", "tertiary"]`, and `danger-ghost` is not listed among them.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message suggests that the `danger-ghost` value is being used in the Button component, which is causing the prop type validation to fail.
**Cause**: The Button component is being used with the `danger-ghost` value for the `kind` prop, which is not a valid option according to the prop type validation. This could be due to a mistake in the component usage or a missing value in the prop type validation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `danger-ghost` value is being used for the `kind` prop in the Button component, but it is not included in the list of valid values for the prop type validation. This causes Storybook to emit a warning for an invalid prop type. To fix this issue, the `danger-ghost` value should either be added to the list of valid values for the `kind` prop type validation or the component usage should be updated to use a valid value.
