Let me analyze the problem and its causes based on the provided GitHub issue description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: PropType warning for invalid `kind` prop value `danger-ghost` in Button component
**Cause**: There's a mismatch between the prop value being passed (`danger-ghost`) and the allowed values defined in the Button component's PropTypes. The allowed values are: ["primary", "secondary", "danger", "ghost", "danger--primary", "danger--tertiary", "danger-tertiary", "tertiary"], but the code is trying to use "danger-ghost" which is not in this list.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent naming convention in button kind values
**Cause**: The PropTypes definition shows inconsistent use of separators in the kind values. Some values use double dashes (`danger--tertiary`), while others use single dash (`danger-tertiary`). This inconsistency in the naming convention could lead to confusion and errors when using the component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from two related problems:
1. The immediate problem is an invalid prop value being used (`danger-ghost`) that isn't included in the allowed PropTypes values for the Button component.
2. There's an underlying design issue with inconsistent naming conventions in the button kinds (mixing single and double dashes), which could be contributing to the confusion when using the component.

To fix these issues, the team should:
1. Either add `danger-ghost` to the allowed PropTypes values if it's a valid button type
2. Or correct the usage to use one of the existing valid button types
3. Standardize the naming convention for button kinds (either consistently use single or double dashes)
