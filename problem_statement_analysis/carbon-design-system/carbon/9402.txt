### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When a user opens a ComboBox and then clicks on the chevron to open another ComboBox, the previously opened ComboBox does not dismiss.
**Cause**: This issue might be due to a change in the event handling mechanism in the `carbon-components-react` package version 10.37.0. The event listeners responsible for dismissing the open ComboBox when another ComboBox is opened might not be functioning as expected. This could be a regression introduced in the newer version of the package.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The ComboBox does not dismiss when a DropDown is opened, but the DropDown dismisses the ComboBox.
**Cause**: The event handling for the DropDown might be correctly implemented to dismiss other open elements, while the ComboBox's event handling might have a bug or missing functionality. This discrepancy suggests that the ComboBox's event listeners or dismissal logic might not be properly set up to handle interactions with other UI elements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue occurs in both Chrome and Firefox, indicating it is not browser-specific.
**Cause**: Since the problem is not browser-specific, it is likely related to the implementation of the ComboBox component in the `carbon-components-react` package. The issue might be in the core logic or event handling of the ComboBox component, which is not properly dismissing other open elements across different browsers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is with the ComboBox component in `carbon-components-react` version 10.37.0, where the event handling for dismissing other open elements is not functioning as expected. This could be due to a regression in the package, a bug in the ComboBox's event listeners, or a missing dismissal logic. The problem is not browser-specific, indicating it is related to the core implementation of the ComboBox component. To resolve this issue, the event handling and dismissal logic of the ComboBox component need to be reviewed and fixed in the `carbon-components-react` package.
