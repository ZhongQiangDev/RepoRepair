### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The SideNav remains expanded after clicking on a SideNavLink, and does not close as expected.
**Cause**: The `onClickSideNavExpand` function, which is responsible for toggling the `isSideNavExpanded` state, is not being called when a `SideNavLink` is clicked. This is likely because the `onClickSideNavExpand` function is only bound to the `HeaderMenuButton` and not to the `SideNavLink` elements. Additionally, the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` does not automatically close the SideNav when navigating to a new route.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The SideNav does not close when clicking on the overlay or the menu bar outside the SideNav.
**Cause**: The `onClickSideNavExpand` function is not bound to any click event on the overlay or the menu bar outside the SideNav. The overlay and the menu bar outside the SideNav do not have any event listeners that trigger the function to close the SideNav. This results in the SideNav remaining open even when the user clicks outside of it.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The user must click on the HeaderMenuButton (cross icon) to close the SideNav, which is not the expected behavior.
**Cause**: The `onClickSideNavExpand` function is only bound to the `HeaderMenuButton`, and there are no other elements or areas that can trigger this function. This limits the user's ability to close the SideNav and does not align with the expected behavior of most applications where clicking outside the SideNav or on a close button should close the SideNav.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues stem from the lack of event listeners on the `SideNavLink`, overlay, and menu bar outside the SideNav. The `onClickSideNavExpand` function, which toggles the `isSideNavExpanded` state, is only bound to the `HeaderMenuButton`, leading to unexpected behavior. To fix these issues, event listeners should be added to the `SideNavLink`, overlay, and menu bar outside the SideNav to call the `onClickSideNavExpand` function and close the SideNav as expected. Additionally, the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` should be configured to close the SideNav when navigating to a new route.
