### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components do not allow for a custom `id` to be assigned to the `legend` element.
**Cause**: The current implementation of these components does not provide a way to pass custom attributes, specifically an `id`, to the `legend` element. This limitation prevents the `legend` from being properly referenced by the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `fieldset`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `RadioButtonGroup` component does not allow for any custom attributes to be passed to the `fieldset` or `legend` elements.
**Cause**: The `RadioButtonGroup` component is designed in a way that it does not accept or propagate custom props to its internal `fieldset` or `legend` elements. This design choice limits the flexibility needed to meet accessibility requirements.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `FormGroup` component allows arbitrary props to be passed to the `fieldset`, but not to the `legend`.
**Cause**: The implementation of the `FormGroup` component is designed to pass props directly to the `fieldset` but does not have a mechanism to pass props specifically to the `legend`. This results in the inability to set an `id` on the `legend` element, which is necessary for proper `aria-labelledby` functionality.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues stem from the lack of flexibility in the current implementations of the `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components. Specifically, these components do not allow for the assignment of a custom `id` to the `legend` element, which is crucial for ensuring proper accessibility support via `aria-labelledby`. Addressing these limitations will require modifications to the components to enable the passing of custom attributes to the `legend` and `fieldset` elements, ensuring that the components can meet the necessary accessibility requirements.
