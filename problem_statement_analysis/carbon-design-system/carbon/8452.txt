### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The data table currently lacks a 40px (`md`) row height option.
**Cause**: The existing data table design does not include a size variant for 40px row height, which is inconsistent with other components that offer this size variant.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual design of the data table does not match the design language used in other components.
**Cause**: The absence of a 40px (`md`) row height option disrupts the visual consistency across different components, leading to a fragmented user experience.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The current row height options may not provide enough space for certain content or use cases.
**Cause**: Without a 40px (`md`) row height, users might face challenges in accommodating larger content or improving readability, especially in scenarios requiring more vertical space.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the lack of a 40px (`md`) row height option in the data table, which leads to inconsistency with other components, disrupts visual design language, and may limit content accommodation. Addressing this by adding the 40px (`md`) row height will enhance consistency, improve user experience, and ensure better content fit.
