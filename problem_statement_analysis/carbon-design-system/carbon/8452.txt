In this case, there isn't exactly a "wrong behavior" to fix, but rather a feature request to implement consistency across components. Let me break this down:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistency in component size options across the design system
**Cause**: The data table component currently lacks a 40px (md) row height option that exists in other components of the system

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential usability gap in data table row heights
**Cause**: The current row height options may not provide enough flexibility for different use cases where medium-sized rows (40px) would be optimal for content display and readability

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is about maintaining consistency in the design system by adding a 40px (md) row height option to the data table component, which already exists in other components. This addition would:
1. Ensure design system consistency across components
2. Provide more flexibility in data table layouts
3. Fill the gap between existing size options
4. Better accommodate various content display needs

This is more of an enhancement request rather than a bug fix, aimed at improving the overall coherence of the design system and providing more options for developers and designers using the component.
