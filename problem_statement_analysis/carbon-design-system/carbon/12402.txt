### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The toggle component does not have a `readonly` prop implemented.
**Cause**: The component lacks the necessary prop definition and logic to handle the `readonly` state. This could be due to missing code in the component's implementation that checks for the `readonly` prop and applies the appropriate styles and behavior.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The toggle component does not have the correct styles applied when it is in the `readonly` state.
**Cause**: The styles for the `readonly` state are not defined or are not being applied correctly. This could be due to missing CSS rules or incorrect class names being applied when the `readonly` prop is set.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The toggle component does not have controls for each state in the playground.
**Cause**: The playground setup is missing the necessary controls to allow users to toggle between different states, including the `readonly` state. This could be due to missing code in the playground setup or incorrect configuration of the controls.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The toggle component does not have a default story for easy copy and paste.
**Cause**: The storybook setup is missing a default story for the toggle component. This could be due to missing code in the storybook configuration or incorrect setup of the default story.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: The toggle component does not have RTL tests for the `readonly` class on the prop.
**Cause**: The test suite is missing the necessary RTL tests to ensure that the `readonly` class is applied correctly when the prop is set. This could be due to missing test cases or incorrect setup of the test suite.

### Answer 6
**Wrong Behavior**: When the toggle is `readonly` and not disabled, the field is not read by screenreaders while not allowing the value to be changed.
**Cause**: The component is not correctly handling the `readonly` state for accessibility. This could be due to missing ARIA attributes or incorrect handling of the `readonly` state in the component's implementation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The toggle component needs to have a `readonly` prop implemented with the correct styles and behavior. The playground controls, default story, and RTL tests need to be set up correctly. Additionally, the component needs to handle the `readonly` state for accessibility to ensure that it is read by screenreaders while not allowing the value to be changed.
