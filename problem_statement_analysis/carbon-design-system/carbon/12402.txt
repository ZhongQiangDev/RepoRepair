Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the issues and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: No read-only state implementation for the toggle component
**Cause**: The current toggle component only has enabled and disabled states, missing the read-only functionality that would allow users to see but not change the toggle state

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing accessibility support for read-only state
**Cause**: The component lacks proper ARIA attributes and screen reader support for the read-only state, which is needed to properly communicate the component's state to assistive technologies

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No visual indication for read-only state
**Cause**: The design system shows styles for enabled, disabled states but lacks specific visual treatments to indicate when a toggle is in read-only mode

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Incomplete test coverage
**Cause**: RTL tests are missing for the read-only functionality, which is needed to ensure the component behaves correctly when in read-only mode

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing playground controls
**Cause**: The component's playground lacks controls for demonstrating and testing the read-only state functionality

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around the incomplete implementation of the read-only state for the toggle component. This includes:
1. Missing core read-only functionality in the component
2. Lack of accessibility features for screen readers
3. Absence of visual indicators for read-only state
4. Insufficient test coverage
5. Incomplete playground controls

The solution requires implementing the read-only state while maintaining the existing component structure and spacing measurements, adding proper accessibility support, creating visual indicators for the read-only state, implementing RTL tests, and adding playground controls for demonstration purposes.
