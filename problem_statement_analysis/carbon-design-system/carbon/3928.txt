### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `iconDescription` is read by JAWS in addition to the button's visible label when it is defined.
**Cause**: The `iconDescription` is being applied even when there is a visible label, which is redundant and can cause confusion for screen reader users. According to accessibility guidelines, `iconDescription` should only be provided when there is no visible label.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The default value of `iconDescription` is 'Add' instead of ''.
**Cause**: The component is not correctly setting the default value for `iconDescription` to an empty string. This results in an incorrect default value being applied when no `iconDescription` is explicitly provided by the caller.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Callers must pass `iconDescription=''` to override the bad default value.
**Cause**: The component's implementation does not handle the default value correctly, requiring callers to explicitly set `iconDescription` to an empty string to avoid the incorrect default value. This is an unnecessary burden on the callers and indicates a flaw in the component's design.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the incorrect handling of `iconDescription` in the `TableBatchAction` component. The component should only apply `iconDescription` when there is no visible label, and it should correctly set the default value to an empty string. These issues stem from a lack of adherence to accessibility guidelines and improper default value handling in the component's implementation. Fixing these issues will improve the accessibility and usability of the component for screen reader users.
