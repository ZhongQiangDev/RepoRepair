Let me analyze the issues and their causes based on the provided GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: JAWS screen reader announces both the iconDescription and the visible button label, causing redundant announcements
**Cause**: The TableBatchAction component is currently requiring iconDescription even when there's already a visible label (children) present. This leads to duplicate information being read by screen readers, which is not a good accessibility practice.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The iconDescription prop has an incorrect default value of 'Add'
**Cause**: The component's default prop value is set to 'Add', forcing developers to explicitly pass an empty string to override it. This is problematic because:
1. It adds unnecessary description when not needed
2. Makes developers write extra code to override the default
3. Could cause confusion if the action isn't actually related to "adding" something

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The iconDescription prop is marked as required even when it shouldn't be
**Cause**: The component's prop validation is incorrectly implemented, making iconDescription a required prop in all cases. It should only be required when there are no children (visible label) present, as that's the only scenario where an icon needs description for accessibility.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The TableBatchAction component has three main issues all relating to the iconDescription prop:
1. It causes duplicate announcements by screen readers by requiring description even with visible labels
2. It has an inappropriate default value that needs manual override
3. Its prop validation is too strict, requiring the prop even when unnecessary

The root of these issues seems to be a misunderstanding of accessibility best practices, where icon descriptions should only be required for unlabeled icons. The component should be modified to:
- Make iconDescription optional when children are present
- Default to an empty string instead of 'Add'
- Only require iconDescription when there are no visible labels
