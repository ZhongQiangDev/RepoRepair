### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Progress Bar component is missing in the Carbon design system.
**Cause**: The Carbon design system currently lacks a Progress Bar component, which is essential for illustrating the percent-complete status of a long-running process. This absence is likely due to the focus on other components like the Progress Indicator, which serves a different purpose.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The current Progress Indicator component does not meet the needs of the Cloud Pak for Data UX team.
**Cause**: The Progress Indicator is designed to illustrate the steps in a process like a wizard, not the percent-complete status of a long-running process. This mismatch in functionality means that the Progress Indicator cannot be used as a substitute for a Progress Bar.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The lack of a Progress Bar component affects the user experience during the installation process.
**Cause**: Without a Progress Bar, users cannot easily see the percent-complete status of the installation process, which can lead to confusion and frustration. The absence of this component makes it difficult for users to gauge the progress and estimate the remaining time.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The design team is working with a proposed design in Sketch, but it is not integrated into the Carbon design system.
**Cause**: The proposed design for the Progress Bar component exists in Sketch, but it has not been incorporated into the Carbon design system. This lack of integration means that the design team cannot leverage the full benefits of the Carbon system, such as consistency and reusability.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the absence of a Progress Bar component in the Carbon design system, which affects the user experience during the installation process. The Progress Indicator component cannot serve as a substitute, and the proposed design in Sketch has not been integrated into the Carbon system. Addressing these issues will improve the user experience and ensure consistency with the Carbon design system.
