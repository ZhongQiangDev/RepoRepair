Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes based on the GitHub issue description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The ComboBox component doesn't properly handle Chinese IME input, showing raw phonetic symbols (ㄓㄨㄥ ㄨㄣˊㄘㄜˋㄕˋ) instead of converted Chinese characters (中文測試)
**Cause**: The ComboBox component likely doesn't properly handle the IME composition events, which are special events fired during the process of composing characters using an Input Method Editor. The component may be interrupting the IME composition process or not waiting for the final character conversion.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue appeared after a specific commit (141a85fd7f81c57e622ce159761b0d51d2f1502c)
**Cause**: A code change in that commit likely modified the input handling logic or event listeners in the ComboBox component, breaking the IME support that previously worked. This suggests the change either:
1. Removed necessary event handlers for IME composition
2. Modified the input processing logic in a way that conflicts with IME functionality

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue affects multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari) and IME systems
**Cause**: Since the problem occurs across different browsers and IME systems, the root cause is likely in the core input handling logic of the ComboBox component rather than being browser-specific. This suggests fundamental issues with how the component handles input events and text composition.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the ComboBox component's inability to properly handle IME input, which was introduced by a specific commit. The problem stems from incorrect handling of IME composition events, preventing proper character conversion from phonetic input to Chinese characters. The issue's presence across multiple browsers indicates it's a fundamental problem with the component's input handling logic rather than a browser-specific implementation issue. A proper fix would require implementing correct IME composition event handling and ensuring the input process isn't interrupted before character conversion is complete.
