### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `legendText` prop of the `FormGroup` component only accepts `string` values and does not support `object` values, such as the `Tooltip` component.
**Cause**: The `FormGroup` component is currently designed to only accept `string` values for the `legendText` prop. This limitation is likely due to the component's implementation, which may not have been designed to handle complex JSX elements like `Tooltip`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user cannot display help information for the `legendText` prop using a `Tooltip` component.
**Cause**: The `FormGroup` component does not support rendering JSX elements for the `legendText` prop. This limitation prevents the user from adding interactive elements like `Tooltip` to provide additional help information.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `legendText` prop does not behave consistently with other components like `TextInput`, which supports JSX elements for the `labelText` prop.
**Cause**: The inconsistency in behavior between `FormGroup` and `TextInput` components is likely due to differences in their implementation. The `TextInput` component may have been designed to support JSX elements for the `labelText` prop, while the `FormGroup` component was not.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `FormGroup` component's `legendText` prop only accepts `string` values and does not support `object` values like the `Tooltip` component. This limitation prevents the user from displaying help information for the `legendText` prop and creates inconsistency with other components like `TextInput`. To fix this issue, the `FormGroup` component's implementation needs to be updated to support JSX elements for the `legendText` prop.
