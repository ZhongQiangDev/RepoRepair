### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The down arrow does not trigger the `onClick` function on the first click, resulting in an empty list.
**Cause**: The `onClick` event might not be properly bound to the down arrow icon. It's possible that the event listener is only attached to the input field and not to the arrow icon, causing the function to not be called when the arrow is clicked.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The list only populates after clicking the combobox/input field, not the arrow icon.
**Cause**: The combobox component might have a default behavior where the arrow icon only toggles the dropdown visibility without triggering the `onClick` function. This could be due to the component's internal event handling, where the arrow click is treated differently from the input field click.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The arrow icon flips but does not populate the list on the first click.
**Cause**: The arrow icon might be triggering a different event (like `onToggle`) that only changes the icon state without calling the `onClick` function. This could be a design choice in the component where the arrow is meant to toggle the dropdown visibility, not to trigger the data fetching logic.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `onClick` function is not being triggered when the down arrow is clicked for the first time. This is likely due to the event listener not being properly attached to the arrow icon or the component's internal event handling treating the arrow click differently. To fix this, the `onClick` function should be explicitly bound to the arrow icon, ensuring that it triggers the AJAX call and populates the list on the first click. Additionally, the component's event handling logic should be reviewed to ensure that both the input field and the arrow icon trigger the same behavior.
