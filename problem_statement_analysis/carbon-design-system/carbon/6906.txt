### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `id` attribute values are not unique within the document.
**Cause**: The `<input>` element and another element share the same `id` value ("carbon-multiselect-example"), which violates the HTML specification that requires `id` attributes to be unique within a document.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Elements with the `option` role are not contained within an element with the `listbox` role.
**Cause**: The `option` role elements are not properly nested within an element that has the `listbox` role. This is a requirement for WAI-ARIA roles to ensure accessibility and proper semantic structure.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `aria-labelledby` attribute references an element that does not exist.
**Cause**: The `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `<div>` element references an `id` ("carbon-multiselect-example-label") that does not exist in the document. This can cause accessibility issues as screen readers and other assistive technologies may not be able to correctly associate the label with the element.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues identified include non-unique `id` attributes, improper nesting of `option` roles within a `listbox` role, and an `aria-labelledby` attribute referencing a non-existent element. These problems can lead to accessibility issues and incorrect behavior in assistive technologies. To resolve these issues, ensure that all `id` attributes are unique, properly nest `option` roles within a `listbox` role, and verify that all `aria-labelledby` attributes reference existing elements.
