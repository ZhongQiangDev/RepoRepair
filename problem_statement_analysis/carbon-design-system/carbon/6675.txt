Based on the GitHub problem description, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination footer shows "items" (plural) when there is only one item displayed
**Cause**: The code in Pagination.js doesn't include conditional logic to check if the total number of items is 1, and therefore doesn't switch to singular form "item" when appropriate

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination footer shows "pages" (plural) when there is only one page of results
**Cause**: Similar to Answer 1, the code in Pagination.js (specifically at lines 148 and 312) lacks conditional logic to check if totalPages equals 1, and therefore doesn't switch to singular form "page" when appropriate

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is a grammatical inconsistency in the pagination component where plural forms ("items" and "pages") are used even when dealing with singular quantities. This occurs in two specific instances:
1. When displaying the total number of items and there is only one item
2. When showing the page count and there is only one page

The root cause in both cases is the lack of conditional logic in the Pagination.js component to handle singular cases appropriately. The fix would require adding conditions to check for `max === 1` or `totalPages === 1` and displaying the singular form of the nouns in these cases.
