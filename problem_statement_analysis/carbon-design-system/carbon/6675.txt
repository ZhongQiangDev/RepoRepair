### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination footer shows "items" even when there is only one item.
**Cause**: The code in `Pagination.js` does not include conditional logic to check if `max === 1` and display the singular form "item" instead of "items".

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The pagination footer shows "pages" even when there is only one page.
**Cause**: The code in `Pagination.js` does not include conditional logic to check if `totalPages === 1` and display the singular form "page" instead of "pages".

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issue arises from the lack of conditional logic in the `Pagination.js` file to handle singular forms when there is only one item or one page. Adding this logic will ensure that the pagination footer correctly displays "item" and "page" in singular form when appropriate. The specific lines of code that need to be modified are lines 148 and 312 in `Pagination.js`.
