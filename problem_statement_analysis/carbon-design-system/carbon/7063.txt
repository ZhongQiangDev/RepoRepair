### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Ordered lists in Firefox start at a random number instead of starting from 1.
**Cause**: The `counter-reset: item` style in the Carbon stylesheet is interfering with the native ordered list numbering. This custom counter is not being properly overridden, causing the list to start at an unexpected number.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Overriding the `counter-reset: item` style does not resolve the issue.
**Cause**: The specificity of the Carbon stylesheet's CSS rules is higher than the custom overrides, making it difficult to override the `counter-reset` property. The `counter-reset` property needs to be removed or its specificity needs to be matched or exceeded by the custom styles.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The use of a `::before` pseudo-element for list item numbering interferes with the native ordered list styles.
**Cause**: The Carbon stylesheet uses a `::before` pseudo-element with `content: counter(item) ".";` to display the list item numbers. This custom numbering system conflicts with the native ordered list numbering, leading to inconsistent behavior across different browsers.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the conflict between the custom counter and pseudo-element numbering system used by Carbon and the native ordered list styles. The `counter-reset: item` style in the Carbon stylesheet is causing the lists to start at a random number in Firefox. Overriding this style is challenging due to CSS specificity issues. To resolve this, the `counter-reset` property needs to be removed or properly overridden, and the use of the `::before` pseudo-element for numbering should be avoided if native ordered list styles are desired.
