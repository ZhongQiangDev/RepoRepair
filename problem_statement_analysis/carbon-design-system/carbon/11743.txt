Let me analyze the issues shown in the GitHub problem description:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Component API prop tables are not rendering properly in the UIShell storybook documentation
**Cause**: The component shows "undefined" in the API table section instead of displaying the actual component properties and documentation. This suggests there may be an issue with how the component metadata or documentation is being generated or loaded into Storybook.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The message "No inputs found for this component" is displayed despite the component likely having properties/inputs
**Cause**: This could be due to:
1. Missing or incorrect component prop types definitions
2. Issues with the Storybook documentation addon configuration
3. Problems with how the component documentation is being extracted from the source code

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple tab options in the Component API section are not showing content
**Cause**: The tabs (Header, HeaderMenuButton, HeaderName, etc.) appear to be empty or not properly populated with their respective API documentation. This could be due to:
1. Missing documentation generation for these specific components
2. Issues with the documentation parser
3. Problems with how nested/child components are being documented

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue appears to be a documentation generation problem in the UIShell components' Storybook implementation. The system is failing to properly extract and display component properties, types, and descriptions in the API tables. This affects multiple components within the UIShell family (Header, HeaderMenuButton, etc.). The root cause likely lies in either the documentation generation pipeline, component metadata extraction, or Storybook configuration. To fix this, the team should:
1. Verify the component prop types are properly defined
2. Check the documentation generation configuration
3. Ensure Storybook addons for API documentation are correctly set up
4. Validate the documentation parsing for nested components
