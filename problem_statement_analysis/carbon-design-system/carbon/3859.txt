### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The inline link does not have a distinct visual indicator for the `:visited` state. The color remains the same as the default state, which can confuse users about whether they have already visited the link.
**Cause**: The `:visited` state color is not clearly differentiated from the default state. The current implementation uses the same color for both states, which fails to provide a visual cue for visited links.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `:focus` state outline is not visually distinct enough. The outline color is similar to the link color, making it hard to distinguish the focused link from other links.
**Cause**: The `:focus` state outline color is too similar to the link color. This lack of contrast reduces the visibility of the focused link, making it difficult for users to identify which link is currently focused.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `:disabled` state does not provide a clear visual indication that the link is disabled. The text color is too similar to the default text color, which can lead users to attempt clicking on a disabled link.
**Cause**: The `:disabled` state color is not sufficiently different from the default text color. This similarity in color does not effectively communicate that the link is disabled, leading to potential user confusion.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The `:hover` state does not provide enough visual feedback. The color change is subtle and may not be noticeable to all users.
**Cause**: The `:hover` state color change is too subtle. The difference between the default and hover states is minimal, which may not provide sufficient visual feedback for users to recognize the hover state.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The inline link implementation has several issues related to visual differentiation. The `:visited`, `:focus`, `:disabled`, and `:hover` states lack clear visual indicators, leading to potential user confusion. Addressing these issues by increasing color contrast and providing distinct visual cues for each state will improve the usability and accessibility of the inline links.
