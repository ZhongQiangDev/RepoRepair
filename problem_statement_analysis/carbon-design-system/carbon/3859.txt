Based on the GitHub problem description and the image shown, I'll analyze the issues and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent link styling across different states (enabled, hover, active, focus, disabled, visited)
**Cause**: The CSS styling rules are not properly unified across different states, leading to visual inconsistencies in how the links appear in different backgrounds and states.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Focus state outline appears too close to the text
**Cause**: The outline CSS property is set to "1px solid $link-01" without proper padding or spacing, making it appear cramped around the text.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Disabled state lacks clear visual distinction
**Cause**: The disabled state only uses a gray color ($disabled-02) without additional visual indicators, which might not provide sufficient contrast or clarity for users to understand the link is disabled.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Visited state color (Purple 60) may not maintain sufficient contrast
**Cause**: The visited link color might not meet accessibility standards for color contrast, especially on different background colors shown in the image (white, gray, and black backgrounds).

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Hover state cursor indicator is inconsistent across different themes
**Cause**: The hover state cursor icon appears differently or may not be clearly visible across different background themes, indicating possible CSS specificity or inheritance issues.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around accessibility and consistency in the inline link component. The problems stem from:
1. Inconsistent styling rules across different link states
2. Poor focus state visualization
3. Insufficient visual distinction for disabled states
4. Potential accessibility issues with color contrast
5. Inconsistent hover state behavior

These issues need to be addressed by:
- Standardizing the link styles across all states
- Improving focus state visibility
- Enhancing disabled state visual indicators
- Ensuring proper color contrast for accessibility
- Maintaining consistent hover state behavior across themes
