### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The small ghost `Button` has a height of 36px instead of the expected 32px.
**Cause**: The CSS class responsible for setting the height of the small ghost `Button` is not correctly defined or applied. The current height of 36px suggests that either the CSS rule for the height is incorrect or there is an overriding CSS rule that is setting the height to 36px.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The small ghost `Button` appears larger than intended.
**Cause**: There might be additional padding or margin applied to the button, which increases its overall size. This can be seen in the screenshot where the button dimensions are 81.5px x 36px, indicating that padding or margin might be contributing to the increased height.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The small ghost `Button` does not match the design specifications.
**Cause**: The design specifications mentioned in the conversation (https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/pull/3283#issuecomment-509766196) may not have been fully implemented or updated in the codebase. This could be due to a discrepancy between the design files and the actual implementation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The small ghost `Button` is larger than intended due to incorrect height settings in the CSS, additional padding or margin, and potential discrepancies between design specifications and implementation. To resolve this issue, the CSS rules for the button height should be reviewed and corrected, any unnecessary padding or margin should be removed, and the design specifications should be double-checked to ensure they are accurately reflected in the code.
