### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The application crashes when `datePickerType="single"` is added to the `DatePicker` component.
**Cause**: The error message indicates that `start.addEventListener` is not a function, suggesting that `start` is undefined or not a valid DOM element. This could be due to a missing or incorrectly referenced DOM element in the `DatePicker` component when `datePickerType="single"` is specified.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The application crashes on load after migrating to Carbon 11.
**Cause**: The migration to Carbon 11 might have introduced breaking changes or deprecated certain functionalities. The `DatePicker` component might have undergone changes that are not compatible with the existing implementation, leading to the crash.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The CodeSandbox example is not working with Carbon 11.
**Cause**: The CodeSandbox environment might not be fully compatible with the latest version of Carbon 11, or there could be missing dependencies or configuration issues that prevent the example from running correctly.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `DatePicker` component crashes when `datePickerType="single"` is used, likely due to an undefined or incorrectly referenced DOM element. The migration to Carbon 11 might have introduced breaking changes, and the CodeSandbox environment might not be fully compatible with the latest version. To resolve these issues, it is recommended to review the Carbon 11 migration guide for any breaking changes related to the `DatePicker` component, ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and configured, and verify that the DOM elements are properly referenced within the component. Additionally, troubleshooting the CodeSandbox environment might involve checking for any missing dependencies or configuration issues specific to the Carbon 11 version.
