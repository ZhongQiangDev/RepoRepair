Let me analyze the DatePicker crash issue based on the provided information:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The DatePicker component crashes immediately when datePickerType="single" is set
**Cause**: The error message indicates that there's an attempt to add an event listener to an undefined 'start' element (TypeError: start.addEventListener is not a function). This suggests that the component is trying to access and attach event handlers to DOM elements before they are properly initialized or mounted.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue specifically appears after migrating to Carbon 11
**Cause**: This indicates a potential breaking change in Carbon 11's DatePicker implementation that wasn't properly handled during the migration. The component's lifecycle management or element reference handling may have changed in the new version.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The error occurs specifically with datePickerType="single" configuration
**Cause**: The single date picker type likely has a different initialization logic compared to other picker types (like range), and this specific path contains the bug where DOM element references are accessed before being properly set up.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue appears to be a timing/initialization problem in Carbon 11's DatePicker component when configured as a single date picker. The component attempts to attach keyboard event listeners (specifically for arrow key navigation) to DOM elements that haven't been properly initialized yet. This is likely a regression introduced in Carbon 11's codebase that affects the component's lifecycle management. The fix would likely involve ensuring proper element initialization before attaching event listeners, or restructuring how the component handles DOM references and event binding for the single date picker type.
