Based on the provided GitHub problem description and screenshots, I'll analyze the accessibility violations found by DAP and Axe-Core:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Invalid WAI-ARIA property identifier for aria-owns and aria-controls attributes
**Cause**: The dropdown component uses invalid IDs "carbon-dropdown-example__menu" for both aria-owns and aria-controls attributes. The issue appears to be related to improper formatting of the ID values, as indicated by the error message stating these ARIA attributes must conform to valid values.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Accessible name does not contain the visible label text
**Cause**: The dropdown component's accessible name (likely set through aria-label or similar attribute) doesn't match or include the visible text shown to users. This creates a disconnect between what sighted users see and what screen reader users hear, leading to poor accessibility.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The React Dropdown component has two main accessibility issues:
1. Technical implementation problem with invalid ARIA attribute values that need to be properly formatted to meet WAI-ARIA specifications
2. Semantic labeling issue where the accessible name doesn't match the visible interface, which could confuse screen reader users

To fix these issues, the development team needs to:
- Ensure proper formatting of ARIA attribute values
- Align the accessible name with the visible label text
- Follow WAI-ARIA best practices for dropdown menu implementations

These changes will improve the accessibility of the component for users relying on assistive technologies like screen readers.
