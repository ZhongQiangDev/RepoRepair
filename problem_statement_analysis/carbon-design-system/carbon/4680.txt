Let me analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes from the GitHub problem description.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: HeaderMenu components are showing up as "Anonymous" in the React Developer Tools browser plugin instead of their proper component names.
**Cause**: The HeaderMenu component is using React.forwardRef() without setting a displayName property. When forwardRef is used without a displayName, React DevTools defaults to showing "Anonymous" for the component name.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: SideNavMenu components are also displaying as "Anonymous" in the React Developer Tools.
**Cause**: Similar to HeaderMenu, the SideNavMenu component is using React.forwardRef() without having its displayName set. This makes debugging and component identification more difficult in development tools.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor developer experience when trying to debug UI Shell components in React Developer Tools.
**Cause**: The lack of proper component naming through displayName makes it harder for developers to:
- Identify specific components in the component tree
- Debug issues related to these components
- Understand the component hierarchy
- Distinguish between different instances of these components

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from improper configuration of React.forwardRef() components in the Carbon Design System's UI Shell. Both HeaderMenu and SideNavMenu components are missing displayName properties, which causes them to show up as "Anonymous" in React Developer Tools. This creates a suboptimal developer experience when debugging or inspecting components. The fix would involve adding proper displayName properties to these forwardRef components, making them easily identifiable in development tools. This is particularly important for a design system like Carbon where component clarity and developer experience are crucial.
