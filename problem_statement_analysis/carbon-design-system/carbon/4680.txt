### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` subcomponents of the `UIShell` are displayed as `Anonymous` in the React browser plugin.
**Cause**: The `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` subcomponents are implemented using `forwardRef`, but they do not have a `displayName` property set. In React, when a component is created using `forwardRef`, it does not automatically inherit the `displayName` of the original component. As a result, the React browser plugin cannot identify the component by name and labels it as `Anonymous`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `Anonymous` label makes it difficult to debug and understand the component hierarchy in the React browser plugin.
**Cause**: Without a `displayName`, developers cannot easily identify which component is causing issues or needs modification. This can lead to confusion and inefficiency during development and debugging processes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `Anonymous` label can lead to inconsistent component naming across the application.
**Cause**: If multiple components are labeled as `Anonymous`, it becomes challenging to maintain consistency in component naming conventions. This can result in a lack of clarity and make it harder for developers to understand the application's structure.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` subcomponents of the `UIShell` are displayed as `Anonymous` in the React browser plugin due to the lack of a `displayName` property when using `forwardRef`. This leads to difficulties in debugging, understanding the component hierarchy, and maintaining consistent component naming conventions. To resolve this issue, the `displayName` property should be set for these components when using `forwardRef`.
