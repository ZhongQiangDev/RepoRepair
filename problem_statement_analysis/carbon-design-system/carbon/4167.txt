### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The row height in the React implementation is 52px instead of the expected 48px as seen on the Carbon Design System page.
**Cause**: The missing `bx--table-column-checkbox` class on the `<td>` element in the React-generated HTML is likely causing the discrepancy in row height. This class is responsible for applying the correct styling and layout that ensures the row height matches the design system's specifications.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `<td>` element with the checkbox in the React implementation does not have the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class.
**Cause**: The React component responsible for rendering the table row and its cells is not applying the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class to the `<td>` element that contains the checkbox. This could be due to a missing prop or a misconfiguration in the component's implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The styling and layout of the table row with the checkbox do not match the Carbon Design System's specifications.
**Cause**: The absence of the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class means that the specific styles defined for this class in the Carbon Components CSS are not being applied. These styles are crucial for ensuring that the checkbox column has the correct padding, margin, and other layout properties that contribute to the overall row height and appearance.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the missing `bx--table-column-checkbox` class on the `<td>` element containing the checkbox in the React implementation. This omission leads to incorrect row height and styling, deviating from the Carbon Design System's specifications. The cause is likely a misconfiguration or missing prop in the React component responsible for rendering the table row and its cells. To resolve this, the component should be updated to include the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class on the appropriate `<td>` element.
