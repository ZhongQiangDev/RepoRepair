Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Submenu items remain visible when the rail is collapsed, creating unwanted whitespace
**Cause**: The collapse/expand state of the rail is not properly synchronized with the submenu's visibility state. The rail component is not triggering the collapse of its child submenu components when transitioning to the collapsed state.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Active/focused submenu items show incorrect visual state in collapsed rail
**Cause**: The focus/active state styling is still being applied to submenu items even when they should be hidden in collapsed state, creating a visual inconsistency with the rail's collapsed design pattern.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Rail doesn't automatically expand when submenu items are accessed via keyboard navigation
**Cause**: Missing keyboard interaction handling that should trigger the rail's expand state when users tab into collapsed submenu items. The accessibility behavior is not properly implemented for keyboard navigation scenarios.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent hamburger menu icon behavior
**Cause**: The hamburger menu icon state is not changing appropriately with the rail's expanded/collapsed states and submenu interactions, indicating a disconnect between the icon's state management and the rail's actual state.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues center around state management and synchronization between the rail component and its submenus. The rail component needs to:
1. Properly collapse/hide submenu items when transitioning to collapsed state
2. Handle focus/active states appropriately in both expanded and collapsed modes
3. Implement correct keyboard navigation behavior that includes auto-expansion
4. Maintain consistent icon states that reflect the current rail state

These issues appear to stem from incomplete implementation of the component's state management system and missing interaction handlers for various user scenarios.
