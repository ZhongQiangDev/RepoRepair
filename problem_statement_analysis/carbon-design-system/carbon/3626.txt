### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When the rail is collapsed, the submenu remains expanded, causing additional whitespace and an awkward active state for focused or selected submenu items.
**Cause**: The submenu's collapse state is not synchronized with the rail's collapse state. The code responsible for handling the rail's collapse event may not be properly triggering the submenu's collapse, or the submenu's collapse logic may not be correctly implemented.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: When the submenu is collapsed, and the user tabs into the menu, the rail expands, but the top submenu item is selected without the rail fully expanding to show the submenu.
**Cause**: The focus event on the submenu item is not correctly triggering the rail's expansion to its full width. The focus event handler may not be properly linked to the rail's expansion logic, or the expansion logic may not be correctly implemented to handle the focus event.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The rail collapses when tabbing off the expanded side nav, but the icon in the top left remains as the hamburger icon instead of changing to the expanded icon.
**Cause**: The icon change logic is not correctly linked to the rail's collapse and expand events. The icon change may be missing from the event handler, or the logic may not be correctly implemented to handle the icon change based on the rail's state.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from a lack of synchronization between the rail's and submenu's collapse states, improper handling of focus events on submenu items, and missing or incorrect logic for changing the top left icon based on the rail's state. Addressing these causes will require reviewing and updating the event handlers and state management logic for the rail and submenu components.
