### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `TableContainer` title and description cannot be referenced to label/describe the `Table` using `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`.
**Cause**: The `TableContainer` does not define unique IDs for its title and description nodes. This prevents the `Table` from referencing these elements for accessibility purposes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Tables must either be labeled by combining the title and description using a single ID on the `TableContainer`, or use `aria-label` for labeling.
**Cause**: The lack of unique IDs for the title and description forces developers to use less optimal methods for labeling tables. Using a single ID for both title and description can be confusing, while `aria-label` is not recommended by ARIA guidelines when the label text is visible on screen.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Without an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute, JAWS uses the table's rows to label it.
**Cause**: The absence of proper labeling attributes causes screen readers like JAWS to default to using the table's rows for labeling, which can lead to a confusing and inaccurate description of the table's purpose and content.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the lack of unique IDs for the `TableContainer` title and description nodes, which prevents proper labeling of the `Table` using `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`. This leads to the need for less optimal labeling methods and can result in screen readers using the table's rows for labeling, causing confusion. To fix these issues, the `TableContainer` should define unique IDs for its title and description nodes, allowing the `Table` to reference them for accessibility purposes.
