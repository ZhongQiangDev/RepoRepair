### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The last selected item loses its selected state when performing a multi-selection using the Shift key.
**Cause**: The issue arises from the logic in the `Tile.js` component where the selected state does not respect the `selected` prop value. Specifically, the code at lines 228 and 239-247 does not correctly handle the selected state when a tile is clicked while the Shift key is held down. This causes the selected state to toggle instead of persisting based on the `selected` prop.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The selected state of a tile is not maintained when it is clicked again while the Shift key is held down.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the `handleClick` function in the `Tile.js` component does not properly check if the tile was previously selected. As a result, it toggles the selected state regardless of the `selected` prop value, leading to unexpected behavior where the tile gets deselected even if it should remain selected.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The selected state of the tiles does not match the expected behavior based on the `selected` prop values.
**Cause**: The `selected` prop values are not being correctly applied to the tiles during multi-selection. This could be due to an issue in the state management or the way the `selected` prop is being passed down to the `Tile` component. The state management logic in the parent component might not be updating the `selected` prop values correctly for each tile.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are related to the incorrect handling of the selected state in the `Tile.js` component and the state management logic in the parent component. The selected state does not respect the `selected` prop values, leading to unexpected toggling of the selected state during multi-selection. To fix these issues, the logic in the `Tile.js` component needs to be updated to correctly handle the selected state based on the `selected` prop values, and the state management in the parent component should ensure that the `selected` prop values are correctly updated and passed down to each tile.
