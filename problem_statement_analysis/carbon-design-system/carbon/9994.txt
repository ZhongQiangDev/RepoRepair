Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided screenshot, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Batch action buttons are getting cut off/clipped on smaller screens, particularly on mobile devices, making the first few items inaccessible.
**Cause**: The batch actions container likely has a fixed width or improper overflow handling, preventing proper horizontal scrolling on smaller viewport sizes.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No horizontal scrolling functionality to access the hidden batch action items
**Cause**: Missing or improper implementation of horizontal scroll behavior in the DataTable's batch actions toolbar. The container might be set to `overflow: hidden` or lacking proper overflow properties to enable scrolling.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Poor responsive design adaptation for the batch actions toolbar
**Cause**: The component's responsive design implementation doesn't properly account for varying screen sizes and doesn't provide an alternative layout or stacking behavior for smaller viewports.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: First items in the batch actions menu are unreachable
**Cause**: The positioning of the batch actions container might be using absolute positioning or CSS transforms that don't account for the full width of all action items, causing the leftmost items to render outside the visible area.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from poor responsive design implementation in the DataTable's batch actions component. The main problems are related to:
1. Improper overflow handling
2. Lack of horizontal scrolling functionality
3. Insufficient responsive design considerations
4. Problematic positioning/layout of action items

To fix these issues, the component needs to be updated to:
- Implement proper overflow handling
- Add horizontal scrolling capability for smaller screens
- Improve responsive design to better handle varying viewport sizes
- Ensure all action items are accessible regardless of screen size
