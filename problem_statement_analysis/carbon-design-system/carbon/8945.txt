### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `FileUploaderDropContainer` component fails the accessibility test due to nested interactive controls.
**Cause**: The `<div>` element with the `role="button"` contains an `<input>` element, which is also interactive. According to WCAG 2.1 checkpoint 4.1.2, interactive controls should not be nested within other interactive controls as this can confuse screen readers and other assistive technologies.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `axe-core` version used in the project does not detect the accessibility violation.
**Cause**: The project is using an outdated version of `axe-core` (v4.1.1), which does not include the test for nested interactive controls. Upgrading to a newer version (v4.2.0 or later) is necessary to detect this violation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The test suite for `FileUploaderDropContainer` lacks an accessibility test.
**Cause**: The test suite for `FileUploaderDropContainer` does not include a test for accessibility violations. Adding a test that checks for `axe-core` violations would help in identifying and fixing such issues early in the development process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the violation of WCAG 2.1 checkpoint 4.1.2 due to nested interactive controls in the `FileUploaderDropContainer` component. This is caused by the `<div>` with `role="button"` containing an `<input>` element. Additionally, the project uses an outdated version of `axe-core`, which does not detect this violation, and the test suite lacks an accessibility test. Upgrading `axe-core`, adding an accessibility test, and restructuring the component to avoid nested interactive controls will resolve these issues.
