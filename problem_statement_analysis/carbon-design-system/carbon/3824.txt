### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The max breakpoint margin in the code is `16px`, while the specs on the carbon website and sketch files state it should be `24px`.
**Cause**: There might be a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation of the grid system. The code might not have been updated to reflect the latest design specifications.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual representation in the code does not match the visual representation in the sketch files and the website.
**Cause**: The code might be using a different set of styles or configurations that do not align with the design files. This could be due to a lack of synchronization between the design and development teams.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The max breakpoint margin is not consistent across different platforms (website, sketch files, and code).
**Cause**: There might be a lack of a centralized source of truth for the design specifications. This can lead to inconsistencies when different teams or individuals refer to different sources.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the inconsistency between the design specifications and the actual implementation of the grid system. This can be caused by a lack of synchronization between the design and development teams, as well as a lack of a centralized source of truth for the design specifications. To fix this issue, the design and development teams should work together to ensure that the code is updated to reflect the latest design specifications, and a centralized source of truth should be established to avoid inconsistencies.
