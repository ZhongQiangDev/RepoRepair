### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The read-only multi-select component does not visually differentiate itself from the editable multi-select component.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks specific styles for the read-only state, such as a distinct background color, border style, or text color that would indicate the component is not editable.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The read-only multi-select component does not have a prop to control its read-only state.
**Cause**: The component's codebase does not include a prop for toggling the read-only state, which is necessary for developers to easily switch between editable and non-editable modes.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The playground controls for the read-only state are missing.
**Cause**: The playground environment lacks controls that allow developers to test and visualize the component in its read-only state, making it difficult to ensure the component behaves as expected in different scenarios.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no default story for the read-only multi-select component.
**Cause**: The absence of a default story means developers do not have a quick and easy way to copy and paste the component into their projects, which can slow down development and increase the likelihood of errors.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop are missing.
**Cause**: The lack of RTL (Right-to-Left) tests means the component may not function correctly in languages that read from right to left, which can lead to a poor user experience for users in those regions.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The read-only multi-select component needs specific styles to visually indicate its read-only state, a prop to control this state, playground controls for testing, a default story for easy implementation, and RTL tests to ensure compatibility with right-to-left languages. Addressing these issues will improve the component's usability, functionality, and accessibility.
