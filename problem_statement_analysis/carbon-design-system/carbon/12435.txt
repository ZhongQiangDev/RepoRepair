Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the issues related to implementing read-only inputs for the multi-select component.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing read-only state implementation in the multi-select component
**Cause**: The component currently lacks a read-only prop and associated styles to handle read-only state, as indicated in the acceptance criteria

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No visual distinction for read-only state
**Cause**: The design system needs specific styles and visual indicators to differentiate between interactive and read-only states of the multi-select component

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of test coverage for read-only functionality
**Cause**: RTL tests for the read-only class and prop behavior are not implemented yet, as mentioned in the acceptance criteria

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing playground controls for state management
**Cause**: The component needs controls in the playground to demonstrate and test different states, including the read-only state

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: No default story implementation
**Cause**: Missing a default story implementation that would make it easy for developers to copy and paste the component with read-only functionality

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues revolve around implementing a complete read-only functionality for the multi-select component. This includes:
1. Adding the read-only prop and associated styles
2. Implementing visual indicators for the read-only state
3. Creating comprehensive RTL tests
4. Adding playground controls for state management
5. Providing a default story implementation

The solution requires both code implementation in the /package/react directory and proper documentation/testing to ensure the component works as expected in read-only mode while maintaining consistency with the existing Carbon component design system.
