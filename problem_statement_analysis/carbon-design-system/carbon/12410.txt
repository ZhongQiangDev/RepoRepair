Let me analyze the slider implementation issue based on the provided images and requirements:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing read-only state implementation in the React package
**Cause**: The component currently lacks the read-only functionality as specified in the acceptance criteria, which needs to be added to the /package/react directory

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: No visual distinction for read-only state
**Cause**: The design system shows regular slider styles but doesn't specify how the read-only state should look visually different from the enabled state

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing playground controls for state management
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria requires controls for each state in the playground, but these haven't been implemented yet for testing different slider states including read-only

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of RTL (Right-to-Left) testing coverage
**Cause**: The component needs RTL tests specifically for the read-only class property, which is currently missing from the test suite

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: No default story implementation
**Cause**: A default story implementation that can be easily copied and pasted is required but hasn't been created yet, making it harder for developers to quickly implement the component

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The slider component requires several key implementations and improvements:
1. Core read-only functionality needs to be added to the React package
2. Visual styling for the read-only state needs to be designed and implemented
3. Playground controls for state management need to be created
4. RTL testing coverage needs to be added specifically for read-only functionality
5. A default story implementation needs to be created for easy implementation reference

The main focus should be on implementing the read-only state while maintaining the existing slider structure and spacing measurements, with appropriate visual feedback to indicate the read-only state to users.
