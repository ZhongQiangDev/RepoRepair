### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The slider thumb (handle) is not applicable to the read-only component.
**Cause**: The design specifications indicate that the slider thumb is not applicable to the read-only component, but the implementation may not have accounted for this. The read-only state should visually indicate that the slider is not interactive, and the thumb should not be present or should be styled differently to reflect this.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The color and typography for the read-only slider may not be correctly implemented.
**Cause**: The color and typography specifications for the slider label and other elements may not be correctly applied in the read-only state. The design specifies certain colors like `$text-secondary`, `$border-subtle-01`, and `$text-primary`, but these may not be correctly mapped to the read-only state in the implementation.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The structure and spacing measurements for the read-only slider may not match the enabled component.
**Cause**: The design specifies that read-only components should use the same structure and spacing measurements as the enabled component. However, the implementation may not have ensured that these measurements are consistent between the two states, leading to visual discrepancies.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The controls for each state in the playground may not be functioning as expected.
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria require controls for each state in the playground, but these controls may not be correctly implemented or may not accurately reflect the read-only state. This could be due to issues in the code that handles state changes or in the way the read-only prop is applied.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: The default story for easy copy and paste may not be correctly set up.
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria require a default story for easy copy and paste, but this story may not be correctly configured. This could be due to missing or incorrect code snippets in the storybook or issues with the way the read-only prop is demonstrated in the default story.

### Answer 6
**Wrong Behavior**: RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop may not be passing.
**Cause**: The acceptance criteria require RTL tests for the read-only class, but these tests may not be correctly implemented or may not be passing. This could be due to issues with the way the read-only class is applied in RTL layouts or with the test cases themselves.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified include the incorrect handling of the slider thumb in the read-only state, potential discrepancies in color and typography, inconsistent structure and spacing measurements, non-functional controls in the playground, incorrect default story setup, and failing RTL tests. Each of these issues stems from a mismatch between the design specifications and the implementation, requiring careful review and adjustment of the code to ensure that the read-only slider component meets all the acceptance criteria.
