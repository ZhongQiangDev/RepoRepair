### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The form control element `<button>` in the Tabs component has no associated label.
**Cause**: The `<button>` elements within the Tabs component are missing attributes such as `aria-labelledby` or `for`, which are necessary to associate the button with a label. This omission prevents screen readers and other assistive technologies from correctly identifying and announcing the purpose of the buttons to users.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The buttons in the Tabs component do not pass accessibility checks.
**Cause**: The lack of an associated label for the `<button>` elements violates accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1 techniques H44 and ARIA16. These standards require that each form control must have an associated label to ensure that the control is properly announced to users of assistive technologies.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The buttons in the Tabs component do not provide a meaningful label for users with dexterity impairments using voice control.
**Cause**: Without an associated label, users relying on voice control may not be able to accurately interact with the buttons. The absence of a label makes it difficult for voice control software to recognize and execute commands related to these buttons.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the `<button>` elements in the Tabs component lack associated labels, leading to accessibility failures. This omission violates WCAG 2.1 standards and negatively impacts users who rely on screen readers or voice control. To resolve this, the buttons should be properly labeled using attributes like `aria-labelledby` or `for`, ensuring that they are accessible and usable for all users, including those with visual or dexterity impairments.
