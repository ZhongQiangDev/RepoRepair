Let me analyze the modal input width issue based on the provided images.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The input field in the modal does not span the full width of the modal container, leaving unnecessary white space on both sides.
**Cause**: This is likely due to incorrect CSS styling where the input field's width property is not set to 100% or there might be padding/margin issues preventing it from taking up the full available width.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The input field's width is inconsistent with the modal's design specifications shown in the second image.
**Cause**: The CSS layout specifications shown in the second image (with measurements like 16px/1rem, 20%, etc.) are not being properly implemented in the current version, causing the input to have incorrect width calculations.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The overall layout proportions in the modal appear to be off compared to the design specifications.
**Cause**: The spacing and sizing guidelines shown in the specification image (48/3, 64/4, etc.) are not being correctly applied to the modal components, affecting not just the input field but the overall layout consistency.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is a regression in the modal's input field width, where it's not spanning the full width as intended. This appears to be caused by:
1. Incorrect CSS width properties or container constraints
2. Misalignment with the design specification measurements
3. Inconsistent implementation of spacing and sizing guidelines

To fix this, the CSS styles need to be updated to ensure the input field spans the full width of its container while adhering to the specified design measurements and spacing guidelines shown in the second image.
