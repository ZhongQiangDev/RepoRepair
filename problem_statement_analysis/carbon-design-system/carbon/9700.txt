### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The input fields in the modal are not spanning the full width of the modal.
**Cause**: The CSS styles applied to the input fields may not be correctly set to make them span the full width. This could be due to missing or incorrect CSS properties such as `width: 100%` or `display: block`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: There might be padding or margin issues within the modal that are preventing the input fields from expanding to the full width.
**Cause**: The modal container or the input fields themselves might have padding or margin settings that are restricting the width of the input fields. Adjusting these properties could resolve the issue.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The layout structure of the modal might be interfering with the input fields' ability to span the full width.
**Cause**: The HTML structure of the modal might have nested elements or flexbox/grid settings that are not allowing the input fields to expand properly. Ensuring the correct layout structure and flex properties can help fix this.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues causing the input fields not to span the full width of the modal are likely related to CSS styling, padding/margin settings, and the HTML layout structure. Adjusting the CSS properties to ensure `width: 100%` and checking for any interfering padding/margin settings, as well as verifying the modal's HTML structure, should resolve the problem.
