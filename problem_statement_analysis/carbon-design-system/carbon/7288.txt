Based on the GitHub problem description and the provided GIFs, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The row gets disabled immediately when all selections are cleared in the multiselect dropdown, without waiting for the user to finish their interaction with the dropdown menu.
**Cause**: The `onChange` event triggers immediately for each selection change, causing premature state updates before the user has finished making their selections.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The dropdown menu closes abruptly when the row gets disabled, interrupting the user's selection process.
**Cause**: The immediate row disable action triggered by the `onChange` event forces the dropdown to close, creating a poor user experience since there's no distinction between intermediate selection states and final selection states.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: No way to differentiate between in-progress selection changes and final selection state.
**Cause**: The current implementation only provides an `onChange` event, lacking a separate event (`onMenuChange`) to track the dropdown menu's open/close state, which would help determine when the user has finished their selection process.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue stems from the lack of proper event handling for multiselect dropdowns in the Carbon component. The current implementation only uses `onChange` events, which trigger immediate updates and can cause premature row disabling and dropdown closing. This creates a poor user experience when users need to make multiple selections. The addition of an `onMenuChange` event would allow developers to properly handle the difference between in-progress selections and final selection states, enabling them to implement more user-friendly behavior like waiting for the dropdown to close before applying certain changes. The current workaround exists but requires hacky solutions, making it important to implement this feature properly in the Carbon component itself.
