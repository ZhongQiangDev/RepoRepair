### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The Expandable Tile with Interactive content cannot have the `aria-expanded="false"` attribute.
**Cause**: The Expandable Tile component is not properly configured to handle the `aria-expanded` attribute when it contains interactive content. This might be due to the component's internal logic not recognizing the need for this attribute when interactive content is present, leading to the violation reported by the IBM Accessibility Checker.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The workaround of adding a hidden button to force the interactive version of the Expandable Tile is necessary.
**Cause**: The Expandable Tile component automatically renders as a button when it contains non-interactive content, which conflicts with the roles of the StructuredList elements inside it. This behavior forces developers to use a workaround to achieve the desired interactive version, indicating a limitation in the component's design that does not accommodate such use cases gracefully.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The StructuredList elements inside the Expandable Tile cause role conflicts when the tile is rendered as a button.
**Cause**: The Expandable Tile component's default behavior of rendering as a button when it contains non-interactive content does not account for the roles of the child elements (StructuredList). This results in a conflict where buttons cannot have children with roles, leading to accessibility issues.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The issues stem from the Expandable Tile component's inability to handle interactive content and the `aria-expanded` attribute correctly. The component's default behavior of rendering as a button when it contains non-interactive content leads to role conflicts with child elements. Additionally, the need for a workaround to achieve the interactive version indicates a design limitation. Addressing these issues would involve updating the component's logic to properly handle interactive content and the `aria-expanded` attribute, as well as ensuring that the component can accommodate the roles of child elements without conflicts.
