Based on the provided screenshots and problem description, I'll analyze the accessibility (DAP) violations in the React MultiSelect component:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The "X" clear button is missing a proper label
**Cause**: The SVG icon used for clearing the selection lacks proper accessibility attributes (aria-label or title) to describe its purpose to screen readers

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: WAI-ARIA widget with IMG role missing nonempty alternate text/label
**Cause**: The component contains an element with role="img" that doesn't have the required alternative text or label attributes to describe the image content for accessibility purposes

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Form controls (checkboxes) are not properly grouped
**Cause**: The checkbox options in the MultiSelect dropdown are not wrapped in appropriate grouping elements (like fieldset/legend) or using proper ARIA group roles to indicate their relationship

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Interactive elements lacking accessible names
**Cause**: Some interactive elements in the component don't have proper accessible names through either aria-label, aria-labelledby, or visible text labels, making them difficult for screen readers to announce

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: The number of DAP violations changes based on component state (7 violations when expanded, 6 when cleared)
**Cause**: The component's accessibility implementation is inconsistent across different states, suggesting that some accessibility attributes are either being removed or rendered incorrectly when the component's state changes

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The MultiSelect component has several accessibility issues that need to be addressed:
1. Missing proper labels for interactive elements (clear button)
2. Improper implementation of WAI-ARIA image roles
3. Lack of proper form control grouping
4. Missing accessible names for interactive elements
5. Inconsistent accessibility attributes across component states

These issues make the component difficult to use with assistive technologies and need to be fixed to comply with accessibility standards. The solutions would involve adding proper ARIA attributes, labels, and grouping structures while ensuring they persist across all component states.
