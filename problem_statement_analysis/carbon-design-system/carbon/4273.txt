Based on the provided GitHub problem description and screenshot, I'll analyze the accessibility issues:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Multiple button elements are missing associated labels according to DAP (Digital Accessibility Platform) scan
**Cause**: The accordion buttons in the skeleton component lack proper aria-labels or associated text labels that would make them accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The buttons are using the bx--accordion_heading class but don't have proper accessibility markup
**Cause**: While the visual styling is applied through CSS classes, the necessary accessibility attributes (like aria-label, aria-expanded, aria-controls) are missing from the button implementation

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Form control elements don't meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) requirements
**Cause**: The implementation focuses on visual presentation but neglects the accessibility requirements that would make the controls usable for all users, including those using assistive technologies

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue centers around accessibility violations in the accordion button components. The buttons lack proper labeling and ARIA attributes that are essential for accessibility compliance. To fix these issues:
1. Each button needs an associated label either through aria-label, aria-labelledby, or visible text content
2. Proper ARIA attributes should be implemented to indicate the button's role and state
3. The accordion component needs to follow WCAG guidelines for form controls and interactive elements

These changes would ensure the component is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.
