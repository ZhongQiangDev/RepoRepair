### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The focus outline appears around the `<input>` element instead of the entire multiselect control when clicking on the filter input.
**Cause**: The click event on the `<input>` element is not properly propagating to the parent multiselect control, causing the focus to be set on the `<input>` element instead of the entire control. This could be due to event handling or focus management issues in the component's implementation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The focus outline appears correctly around the entire multiselect control when clicking more to the left, but not when clicking on the filter input.
**Cause**: The click event detection logic might be based on the position of the click within the control. If the click is detected within the `<input>` area, it focuses on the `<input>` instead of the entire control. This suggests that the event handling logic needs to be adjusted to ensure the entire control receives focus regardless of where the click occurs within the control.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The issue seems to be a regression from a previous fix (#4721).
**Cause**: The changes made in #4721 might have inadvertently altered the focus behavior of the multiselect component. This could be due to modifications in the event handling, focus management, or DOM structure that were not fully tested for all interaction scenarios.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is that the focus outline is not consistently applied to the entire multiselect control when interacting with the filter input. This is likely due to event handling and focus management issues within the component. The regression from a previous fix (#4721) suggests that the changes made then may have introduced this behavior. To resolve this, the event handling logic should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the entire control receives focus regardless of where the click occurs within the control. Additionally, thorough testing should be conducted to prevent similar regressions in the future.
