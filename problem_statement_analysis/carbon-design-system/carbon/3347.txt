### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The left button in the `ComposedModal` is gray instead of black when the `danger` property is set to `true`.
**Cause**: The `ComposedModal` component uses a conditional statement `kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}` to set the kind property of the left button. When `danger` is `true`, the button's kind is set to `tertiary`, which results in a gray button. This behavior differs from the `Modal` component, where the left button's kind is set to `secondary` (black) when `danger` is `true`.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ComposedModal` component does not match the expected behavior of the `Modal` component when the `danger` property is set to `true`.
**Cause**: The conditional logic in the `ComposedModal` component's source code is different from the logic used in the `Modal` component. This discrepancy leads to inconsistent button styling between the two components.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `ComposedModal` component cannot be properly demonstrated in the CodeSandbox environment.
**Cause**: There may be an issue with the CodeSandbox setup or the way the `ComposedModal` component is imported and used in the sandbox. This prevents the user from creating a reduced test case to further investigate the issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is the inconsistent button styling between the `Modal` and `ComposedModal` components when the `danger` property is set to `true`. This is caused by the different conditional logic used in the two components. Additionally, there is a problem with demonstrating the issue in the CodeSandbox environment, which may be due to setup or import issues. To resolve these issues, the conditional logic in the `ComposedModal` component should be updated to match the behavior of the `Modal` component, and the CodeSandbox setup should be reviewed to ensure proper functionality.
