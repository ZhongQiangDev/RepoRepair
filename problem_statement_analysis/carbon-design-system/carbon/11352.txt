### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `IconButton` has incorrect right padding, making it appear misaligned or improperly spaced compared to the expected design.
**Cause**: The `IconButton` component is likely using the padding styles intended for medium-sized buttons (`md btn`), which have a different padding calculation. This mismatch in padding styles results in the observed incorrect right padding.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The visual appearance of the `IconButton` does not match the design specifications, as seen in the screenshot.
**Cause**: The CSS styles applied to the `IconButton` may not be correctly targeting the specific padding properties for the icon button variant. This could be due to incorrect class names, missing styles, or an issue with the CSS specificity.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `IconButton` does not align with the expected Carbon Design System guidelines for icon buttons.
**Cause**: There might be a discrepancy in the implementation of the `IconButton` component within the `@carbon/react` package. The component might not be adhering to the latest design updates or changes in the Carbon Design System, leading to the observed padding issue.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is the incorrect right padding on the `IconButton`, which stems from the component using the wrong padding styles (likely from medium-sized buttons). This misalignment is caused by either a mismatch in the CSS styles, incorrect class targeting, or a discrepancy in the implementation of the `IconButton` within the `@carbon/react` package. Addressing these causes should resolve the padding issue and ensure the `IconButton` adheres to the expected design specifications.
