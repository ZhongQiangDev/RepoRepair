### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The background element scrolls when the modal is open.
**Cause**: The modal does not have a mechanism to disable the scrolling of the background element. This could be due to the absence of a specific class or CSS rule that prevents the background from scrolling when the modal is active.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The user experience is negatively impacted as the background scrolling can be distracting and confusing.
**Cause**: The current implementation of the modal does not follow the expected behavior where the background should remain static while the modal is open. This could be due to the lack of a proper event listener or a CSS property that locks the background scrolling.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: There is no clear indication or documentation on how to disable the background scrolling when the modal is open.
**Cause**: The Carbon Design System documentation or the package itself might not provide a straightforward way or clear instructions on how to disable the background scrolling. This could be due to the absence of a feature or a lack of detailed documentation.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the background element scrolls when the modal is open, which is not the expected behavior. This is caused by the lack of a mechanism to disable background scrolling, the absence of a proper event listener or CSS rule, and the lack of clear documentation on how to achieve the desired behavior. To fix this, the Carbon Design System could implement a feature similar to Bootstrap's `modal-open` class, which disables background scrolling when the modal is active. Additionally, providing clear documentation on how to use this feature would improve the user experience.
