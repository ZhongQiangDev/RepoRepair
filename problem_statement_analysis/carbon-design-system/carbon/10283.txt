Let me analyze the date picker accessibility issue based on the provided information.

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Keyboard navigation doesn't work when the calendar is opened by clicking the calendar icon
**Cause**: This appears to be a focus management issue. When the calendar is opened via the icon click, the focus is likely not being properly transferred to the calendar widget, preventing keyboard interaction.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Inconsistent behavior between two different ways of opening the same calendar
**Cause**: The component is handling focus management differently based on the trigger method (input field click vs. calendar icon click). This suggests there might be different event handlers or focus management logic for these two interaction paths.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Potential violation of WCAG 2.1 keyboard accessibility guidelines
**Cause**: The calendar icon interaction path doesn't maintain proper keyboard operability, which is required by WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard) and 2.1.2 (No Keyboard Trap).

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The core issue revolves around improper focus management in the date picker component. When opened via the calendar icon, the component fails to properly transfer keyboard focus to the calendar widget, making it impossible to navigate using arrow keys. This creates an inconsistent user experience between the two opening methods and violates accessibility guidelines. The main technical fix would likely involve:
1. Standardizing the focus management between both opening methods
2. Ensuring proper focus transfer to the calendar widget regardless of how it's opened
3. Implementing consistent keyboard navigation handlers for both interaction paths

This appears to be a significant accessibility bug that needs to be addressed to ensure equal access for keyboard users.
