### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: When the calendar is opened by clicking on the calendar icon, it is impossible to select a date using the keyboard arrows.
**Cause**: The focus management is not correctly set up when the calendar is opened via the icon click. The calendar's date grid does not receive focus, preventing keyboard navigation.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Keyboard navigation works fine when the calendar is opened by clicking on the input field.
**Cause**: When the calendar is opened via the input field, the focus is correctly transferred to the date grid, enabling keyboard navigation. This indicates that the focus handling logic is different or missing when the calendar is opened via the icon.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The calendar icon click does not trigger the same focus behavior as the input field click.
**Cause**: The event handlers for the calendar icon click and the input field click are likely not synchronized. The icon click may not trigger the necessary focus event on the date grid, whereas the input field click does.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issue is related to focus management within the date picker component. When the calendar is opened via the icon, the focus is not correctly transferred to the date grid, preventing keyboard navigation. This is likely due to differences in the event handling logic between the icon click and the input field click. Ensuring consistent focus behavior across both methods of opening the calendar should resolve the issue.
