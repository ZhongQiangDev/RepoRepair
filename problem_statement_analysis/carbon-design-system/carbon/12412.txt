Based on the GitHub problem description and images provided, I'll analyze the issues related to the RadioButton implementation:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing read-only state implementation for RadioButton component
**Cause**: The current implementation doesn't include a read-only state property and its associated styles, as shown in the design specifications. This is evident from the acceptance criteria which specifically requests adding a prop for read-only functionality.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Lack of playground controls for different states
**Cause**: The component doesn't have controls in the playground to demonstrate and test different states (enabled, disabled, read-only), making it difficult for developers to verify the component's behavior in various scenarios.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: Missing RTL (Right-to-Left) testing support
**Cause**: The component lacks RTL tests for the read-only class property, which is necessary for ensuring proper functionality in right-to-left language contexts.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: Absence of default story implementation
**Cause**: There's no default story implementation that developers can easily copy and paste, making it more time-consuming to implement the component in new projects.

### Answer 5
**Wrong Behavior**: Component not properly coded in /package/react
**Cause**: Based on the acceptance criteria, the component needs to be implemented in the correct location (/package/react) to maintain proper project structure and organization.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The RadioButton component requires several important implementations and improvements:
1. Addition of read-only state functionality and styling
2. Implementation of playground controls for state testing
3. Integration of RTL testing support
4. Creation of a default story for easy implementation
5. Proper component placement in the project structure

These issues primarily stem from incomplete implementation of the component's features and testing infrastructure. The acceptance criteria clearly outline these requirements, and addressing each point will result in a more robust and user-friendly RadioButton component.
