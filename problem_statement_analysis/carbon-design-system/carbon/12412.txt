### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The read-only radio button does not visually differentiate itself from the editable radio button.
**Cause**: The current implementation lacks a distinct visual style for the read-only state, making it indistinguishable from the editable state. This can confuse users who may not realize that the radio button is read-only.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The spacing and structure of the read-only radio button do not match the design specifications.
**Cause**: The implementation may not adhere to the specified spacing and structure guidelines for read-only components. This can lead to inconsistencies in the user interface, affecting the overall design integrity.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The color and typography for the read-only radio button do not align with the design guidelines.
**Cause**: The current implementation may not use the correct color variables and typography styles for the read-only state. This can result in a mismatch with the overall theme and make the read-only state less noticeable or confusing.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop are missing.
**Cause**: The implementation lacks the necessary Right-to-Left (RTL) tests for the read-only class. This can lead to potential issues when the component is used in RTL languages, affecting the user experience for those users.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues identified include the lack of distinct visual styles for the read-only state, incorrect spacing and structure, mismatched color and typography, and missing RTL tests. Addressing these issues will ensure that the read-only radio button is visually distinct, adheres to design specifications, matches the overall theme, and functions correctly in RTL languages.
