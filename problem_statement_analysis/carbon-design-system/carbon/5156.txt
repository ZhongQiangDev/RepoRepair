### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onChange` event is not being fired when interacting with the SelectableTile component.
**Cause**: The `onChange` prop is not being properly handled within the SelectableTile component. It seems that the component is only set up to handle `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` events, but not `onChange`. This could be due to a missing implementation or incorrect event binding within the component's code.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The console logs only show `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` events, but no `onChange` events.
**Cause**: The SelectableTile component might not be passing the `onChange` prop down to the underlying DOM element or event handler. This could be due to a missing or incorrect prop forwarding mechanism within the component.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The SelectableTile component does not behave as expected according to the documentation.
**Cause**: There might be a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation of the SelectableTile component. The documentation suggests that `onChange` should be fired, but the current implementation does not support this. This could be due to an outdated documentation or a bug in the component's code.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue is that the `onChange` event is not being fired when interacting with the SelectableTile component. This could be due to a missing implementation of the `onChange` prop within the component, incorrect event binding, or a discrepancy between the documentation and the actual implementation. To fix this issue, the SelectableTile component needs to be updated to properly handle the `onChange` prop and ensure that it is passed down to the underlying DOM element or event handler. Additionally, the documentation should be reviewed and updated if necessary to reflect the actual behavior of the component.
