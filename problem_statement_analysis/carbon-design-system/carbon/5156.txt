Based on the provided GitHub issue description and code samples, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `onChange` event handler is not firing when the SelectableTile is clicked or interacted with via keyboard, while `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` events are working.
**Cause**: Looking at the code, the `onChange` handler is properly defined but there appears to be a disconnect in the component's internal event propagation. The component is likely not properly propagating the selection state change to trigger the `onChange` event after handling the click or keyboard events.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The SelectableTile's selection state is not being updated despite user interactions.
**Cause**: The `selected` prop is set to `{false}` statically in the code, but there's no state management to toggle this value. Without proper state management to update the `selected` prop, the tile remains unselected regardless of user interaction.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The component's behavior differs from what's documented in the Carbon Design System storybook.
**Cause**: There's a version mismatch or potential regression in the Carbon components being used (carbon-components@10.9.2 and carbon-components-react@7.9.2). The storybook documentation might be reflecting behavior from a different version than what's being implemented.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issue stems from three interconnected problems: 1) The `onChange` event handler is not being triggered despite being properly defined, 2) The selection state is not being managed properly due to static `selected` prop value, and 3) There's a potential version mismatch between the implementation and documentation. To fix these issues, the component needs proper state management for the `selected` prop, and the internal event propagation mechanism needs to be reviewed to ensure `onChange` is triggered appropriately after selection state changes. Additionally, upgrading to the latest version of Carbon components might resolve any version-specific issues.
