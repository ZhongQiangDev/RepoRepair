Based on the GitHub issue description and the provided information, I'll analyze the wrong behaviors and their causes:

### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The aria-label attribute on the Toggle component is not being read by screen readers despite being marked as required.
**Cause**: There appears to be an implementation issue in the Toggle component where the aria-label, although accepted as a prop, is not properly being applied to the underlying HTML element that screen readers interact with.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: Users have to provide the same label information multiple times (labelText, labelA/labelB, and aria-label) to achieve both visual and accessible labeling.
**Cause**: The component design doesn't have a unified labeling strategy, instead splitting labeling functionality across multiple props without proper coordination between them. This leads to redundant prop requirements and potential inconsistencies.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The labelA and labelB props are hidden from screen readers, reducing accessibility.
**Cause**: The implementation likely uses CSS visibility or similar techniques to show/hide these labels visually without proper consideration for screen reader accessibility. The labels might be implemented in a way that excludes them from the accessibility tree.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: No default variant exists for showing labels next to toggles in an accessible way.
**Cause**: The component design focuses primarily on the compact toggle implementation, lacking flexibility in layout options that would better serve different use cases while maintaining accessibility.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The Toggle component has several accessibility-related issues stemming from its implementation. The main problems center around improper handling of ARIA attributes, inconsistent labeling mechanisms, and hidden screen reader content. The component needs a redesign that:
1. Properly implements aria-label support
2. Consolidates labeling strategy to avoid redundancy
3. Ensures all labels are accessible to screen readers
4. Provides flexible layout options with built-in accessibility
These issues collectively violate WCAG 2.1 SC 3.3.2, which requires proper labeling of form controls.
