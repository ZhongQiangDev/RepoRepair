### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `aria-label` provided to the `Toggle` component is not being read by the screen reader.
**Cause**: The `aria-label` attribute is not being correctly applied to the toggle element in the DOM. This could be due to the implementation of the `Toggle` component not properly forwarding the `aria-label` prop to the relevant DOM element.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The `labelA` and `labelB` props are hidden to screen readers.
**Cause**: These props are likely used to visually display labels for the toggle states but are not exposed to screen readers. This could be because they are not associated with the toggle element in a way that is accessible to assistive technologies.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The `labelText` prop is not a required prop, but it is the only way to label a toggle that is read by screen readers.
**Cause**: The `Toggle` component may not have a clear and consistent way to handle accessibility labels. The `aria-label` is expected to be the standard way to provide accessibility labels, but it is not functioning as intended. This could be due to a lack of proper implementation or documentation on how to use the `aria-label` with the `Toggle` component.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The main issues are that the `aria-label` is not being read by screen readers, the `labelA` and `labelB` props are hidden to screen readers, and the `labelText` prop is the only way to label a toggle that is read by screen readers. These issues are likely due to the `Toggle` component not properly forwarding the `aria-label` prop to the relevant DOM element, not associating the `labelA` and `labelB` props with the toggle element in a way that is accessible to assistive technologies, and not having a clear and consistent way to handle accessibility labels. To fix these issues, the `Toggle` component should be updated to properly forward the `aria-label` prop to the relevant DOM element, associate the `labelA` and `labelB` props with the toggle element in a way that is accessible to assistive technologies, and provide clear and consistent documentation on how to use the `aria-label` with the `Toggle` component.
