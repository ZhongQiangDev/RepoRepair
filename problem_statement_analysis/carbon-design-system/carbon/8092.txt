### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning icon is not properly aligned with the text inside the select component.
**Cause**: The padding or margin settings for the warning icon might be incorrect, causing it to be misaligned with the text. The image shows that the icon is not centered vertically with the text "Choose an option."

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The spacing between the warning icon and the dropdown arrow is inconsistent.
**Cause**: The spacing between the warning icon and the dropdown arrow is not uniform across different states. The image shows that the spacing is 8px in one state and 16px in another, which can cause visual inconsistency.

### Answer 3
**Wrong Behavior**: The warning message is not clearly visible or distinguishable.
**Cause**: The warning message color (text-01) might not provide enough contrast against the background, making it difficult to read. Additionally, the placement of the warning message might not be intuitive, leading to confusion for the user.

### Answer 4
**Wrong Behavior**: The icon fill and inner fill colors might not be visually distinct.
**Cause**: The icon fill (support-03) and icon inner fill (black) might not provide enough contrast, making the warning icon less noticeable. This can lead to the warning state being overlooked by the user.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The select component's warning state has several issues that need to be addressed. The warning icon needs proper alignment with the text, consistent spacing with the dropdown arrow, and better color contrast for both the warning message and the icon. Fixing these issues will improve the visual clarity and user experience of the warning state in the select component.
