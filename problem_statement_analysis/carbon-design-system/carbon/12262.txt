### Answer 1
**Wrong Behavior**: The `headers` attribute value "expand" does not reference a valid `id` in the document.
**Cause**: The `headers` attribute in the `<td>` element is set to "expand," but there is no corresponding `id="expand"` in the document. This causes the accessibility checker to flag the issue because the `headers` attribute should reference an `id` that exists in the document to properly associate the header with the table cell.

### Answer 2
**Wrong Behavior**: The table component may be missing some `id` elements that affect accessibility.
**Cause**: The table structure may not have unique `id` attributes for certain elements, such as headers or rows, which are necessary for assistive technologies to correctly interpret the table structure. This can lead to confusion for users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

### Conclusion
**Summary**: The primary issues identified are the incorrect use of the `headers` attribute and the potential lack of necessary `id` elements in the table structure. The `headers` attribute in the `<td>` element references an `id` that does not exist in the document, which violates accessibility standards. Additionally, the table may be missing some `id` elements that are crucial for assistive technologies to properly interpret the table. Addressing these issues by ensuring all `headers` attributes reference valid `id`s and adding necessary `id` elements to the table structure will improve accessibility.
