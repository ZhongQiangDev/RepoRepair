Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The issue occurs when `--runxfail` is used, causing skip location reporting to point to the internal pytest implementation rather than the actual test location.

The problem is in the condition that checks whether to update the skip location. Currently, it checks `skipped_by_mark_key` which is always True by default, but it should only update the location if we're not using `--runxfail`.

Here's the fix:

```python
### src/_pytest/skipping.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    elif (
        item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True)
        and rep.skipped
        and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple
    ):
=======
    elif (
        not item.config.option.runxfail
        and item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True)
        and rep.skipped
        and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple
    ):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a check for `not item.config.option.runxfail` to ensure we only modify the skip location when `--runxfail` is not being used. This preserves the original skip location reporting behavior when running normally, while preventing interference when `--runxfail` is active.

The change ensures that:
1. When running without `--runxfail`, skip locations will point to the test definition
2. When running with `--runxfail`, the skip location reporting remains unmodified
3. The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing behavior for all other cases
