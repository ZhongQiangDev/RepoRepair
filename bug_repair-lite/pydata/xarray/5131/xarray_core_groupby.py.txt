Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `__repr__` method of the `GroupBy` class where there is a trailing whitespace in the first line of output. Looking at the code, I can locate this in the `__repr__` method around line 400.

Here's the fix to remove the trailing whitespace:

```python
### xarray/core/groupby.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __repr__(self):
        return "{}, grouped over {!r} \n{!r} groups with labels {}.".format(
            self.__class__.__name__,
            self._unique_coord.name,
            self._unique_coord.size,
            ", ".join(format_array_flat(self._unique_coord, 30).split()),
        )
=======
    def __repr__(self):
        return "{}, grouped over {!r}\n{!r} groups with labels {}.".format(
            self.__class__.__name__,
            self._unique_coord.name,
            self._unique_coord.size,
            ", ".join(format_array_flat(self._unique_coord, 30).split()),
        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix removes the trailing space before `\n` in the format string. This will resolve the flake8 warning about trailing whitespace while maintaining the same functional output, just without the extra space that was causing issues with the doctests.

The change is minimal but important - we simply removed the space between `{!r}` and `\n` in the format string. This ensures that:

1. The flake8 linter won't complain about trailing whitespace
2. The doctest output will match exactly
3. The functionality remains exactly the same
4. The output is still readable and properly formatted

This change aligns with both the flake8 requirements and doctest expectations while maintaining clean git diffs.
