Based on the issue description, the bug is that the Pipeline class doesn't implement `__len__`, which is needed to support the indexing operation `pipe[:len(pipe)]`. The fix is to add a `__len__` method to the Pipeline class that returns the number of steps.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sklearn/pipeline.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @property
    def _pairwise(self):
        # check if first estimator expects pairwise input
        return getattr(self.steps[0][1], '_pairwise', False)


=======
    @property
    def _pairwise(self):
        # check if first estimator expects pairwise input
        return getattr(self.steps[0][1], '_pairwise', False)

    def __len__(self):
        """Returns the length of the Pipeline"""
        return len(self.steps)

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the `__len__` method to the Pipeline class, which simply returns the length of the steps list. This enables operations like `pipe[:len(pipe)]` to work correctly.

The placement is after the `_pairwise` property and before the FeatureUnion class definition, maintaining the same level of indentation as other Pipeline class methods.

This change allows users to get the length of a pipeline and use it in slicing operations, which is the functionality requested in the issue.
