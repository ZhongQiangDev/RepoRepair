Based on the issue description, the bug occurs in the `_sparse_fit` method of `BaseLibSVM` class when handling empty support vectors. The error happens because `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class` is dividing by zero when there are no support vectors.

Here's the fix that handles the empty support vectors case:

```python
### sklearn/svm/base.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)
        dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,
                                     dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)
        self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
            (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
            (n_class, n_SV))
=======
        if n_SV == 0:
            # Handle empty support vectors case
            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix((n_class, n_SV))
        else:
            dual_coef_indices = np.tile(np.arange(n_SV), n_class)
            dual_coef_indptr = np.arange(0, dual_coef_indices.size + 1,
                                       dual_coef_indices.size / n_class)
            self.dual_coef_ = sp.csr_matrix(
                (dual_coef_data, dual_coef_indices, dual_coef_indptr),
                (n_class, n_SV))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Checks if there are any support vectors (n_SV == 0)
2. If there are no support vectors, creates an empty sparse matrix with the correct dimensions
3. Otherwise proceeds with the original logic for non-empty support vectors

The fix prevents the ZeroDivisionError by handling the empty case explicitly, while maintaining the expected behavior of returning an empty sparse matrix when there are no support vectors.
