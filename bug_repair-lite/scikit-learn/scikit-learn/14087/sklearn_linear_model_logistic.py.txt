Based on the issue description and error trace, the bug occurs in the LogisticRegressionCV class when refit=False. The error happens because the code tries to access best_indices[i] for coefs_paths indexing, but the dimensions don't match when using multinomial mode.

The fix needs to handle the multinomial case properly when refit=False by adjusting how the coefficients are averaged across folds.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                if self.multi_class == 'ovr':
                    w = np.mean([coefs_paths[i, best_indices[i], :]
                                 for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)
                else:
                    w = np.mean([coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]
                                 for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)

                if multi_class == 'ovr':
                    w = np.mean([coefs_paths[i, best_indices[i], :]
                                 for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)
                else:
                    w = np.mean([coefs_paths[i, :, best_indices[i], :]
                                 for i in range(len(folds))], axis=0)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:

1. Changes `self.multi_class` to `multi_class` to be consistent with the rest of the code
2. Most importantly, fixes the indexing for the multinomial case by using `coefs_paths[i, :, best_indices[i], :]` instead of `coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]`

The original code was incorrectly trying to index the first dimension with ':' which caused the "too many indices for array" error. The fix properly indexes the folds first with i, then gets all classes with ':' before applying the best_indices selection.

This matches the shape of coefs_paths which is (n_folds, n_classes, n_Cs, n_features) in the multinomial case.
