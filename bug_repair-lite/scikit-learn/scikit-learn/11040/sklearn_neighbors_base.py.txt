Based on the issue description, the bug is that the `n_neighbors` parameter validation is missing for float values, which causes a TypeError when trying to use float values like `n_neighbors=3.0`. This occurs in both the constructor and the `kneighbors()` method.

The fix needs to be added in the `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors()` method and `NeighborsBase.__init__()` to validate that `n_neighbors` is an integer.

Here are the necessary edits:

```python
### sklearn/neighbors/base.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __init__(self, n_neighbors=None, radius=None,
                 algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, metric='minkowski',
                 p=2, metric_params=None, n_jobs=1):

        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
        self.radius = radius
        self.algorithm = algorithm
=======
    def __init__(self, n_neighbors=None, radius=None,
                 algorithm='auto', leaf_size=30, metric='minkowski',
                 p=2, metric_params=None, n_jobs=1):

        if n_neighbors is not None and not isinstance(n_neighbors, (int, np.integer)):
            raise TypeError("n_neighbors does not take float values, got %r"
                          % n_neighbors)
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
        self.radius = radius
        self.algorithm = algorithm
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```python
### sklearn/neighbors/base.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if n_neighbors is None:
            n_neighbors = self.n_neighbors

        if X is not None:
=======
        if n_neighbors is None:
            n_neighbors = self.n_neighbors
            
        if not isinstance(n_neighbors, (int, np.integer)):
            raise TypeError("n_neighbors does not take float values, got %r"
                          % n_neighbors)

        if X is not None:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:

1. Add validation in the constructor to ensure n_neighbors is an integer when provided
2. Add validation in kneighbors() method to ensure n_neighbors is an integer when provided
3. Use consistent error messaging for both checks

The error message is clear and helpful, telling users that float values are not accepted for n_neighbors. We also need to import numpy for the np.integer type check, but that's already imported at the top of the file.

This will catch float values early with a clear error message rather than letting them propagate to a less clear TypeError later in the execution.
