I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when a note tag (like "FIXME", "XXX", "TODO") consists entirely of punctuation characters (like "???"), it's not being detected by the fixme pattern in the `process_tokens` method of the `EncodingChecker` class.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `open` method where the regex pattern is constructed. The current implementation escapes each note tag using `re.escape()`, but there's an issue with how the pattern is being matched later.

In the `process_tokens` method, the code is converting the comment text to lowercase before matching with `self._fixme_pattern.search("#" + comment_text.lower())`. This works fine for alphanumeric tags, but when a tag consists entirely of punctuation (like "???"), the lowercase conversion doesn't affect it, but the pattern matching fails.

## Fix

The issue is in the regex pattern construction. We need to ensure that punctuation-only tags are properly matched. The problem is that the regex is looking for word boundaries (`\b`) which don't work correctly with punctuation-only strings.

Here's the fix:

```python
### pylint/checkers/misc.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        notes = "|".join(re.escape(note) for note in self.config.notes)
        if self.config.notes_rgx:
            regex_string = rf"#\s*({notes}|{self.config.notes_rgx})\b"
        else:
            regex_string = rf"#\s*({notes})\b"
=======
        notes = "|".join(re.escape(note) for note in self.config.notes)
        if self.config.notes_rgx:
            regex_string = rf"#\s*({notes}|{self.config.notes_rgx})(?:\b|(?=\s|$))"
        else:
            regex_string = rf"#\s*({notes})(?:\b|(?=\s|$))"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the regex pattern to match either a word boundary (`\b`) OR a position followed by whitespace or the end of the string (`(?=\s|$)`). This ensures that punctuation-only tags like "???" will be properly matched.

The `(?=\s|$)` is a positive lookahead assertion that checks if the position is followed by whitespace or the end of the string, which works for punctuation characters where word boundaries don't apply.
