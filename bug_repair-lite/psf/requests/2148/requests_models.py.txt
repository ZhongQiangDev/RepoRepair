Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in the `iter_content` method of the Response class where socket errors are not being properly caught and wrapped in requests exceptions. The error occurs when reading chunks from the raw response stream.

Here's the fix that wraps socket errors in a ConnectionError exception:

```python
### requests/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            try:
                # Special case for urllib3.
                try:
                    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
                        yield chunk
                except IncompleteRead as e:
                    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)
                except DecodeError as e:
                    raise ContentDecodingError(e)
            except AttributeError:
=======
            try:
                # Special case for urllib3.
                try:
                    for chunk in self.raw.stream(chunk_size, decode_content=True):
                        yield chunk
                except IncompleteRead as e:
                    raise ChunkedEncodingError(e)
                except DecodeError as e:
                    raise ContentDecodingError(e)
                except socket.error as e:
                    raise ConnectionError(e)
            except AttributeError:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds a new except clause to catch socket.error exceptions
2. Wraps them in a ConnectionError exception which is more appropriate for the requests library
3. Maintains the existing error handling for IncompleteRead and DecodeError

We also need to add the socket import and ConnectionError to the imports at the top of the file:

```python
### requests/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from .exceptions import (
    HTTPError, RequestException, MissingSchema, InvalidURL,
    ChunkedEncodingError, ContentDecodingError)
=======
import socket
from .exceptions import (
    HTTPError, RequestException, MissingSchema, InvalidURL,
    ChunkedEncodingError, ContentDecodingError, ConnectionError)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that socket errors are properly caught and wrapped in requests exceptions, providing a more consistent error handling experience for users of the library.
