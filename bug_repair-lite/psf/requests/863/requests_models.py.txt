Based on the issue description, the bug is in the Request class's handling of hooks in the `__init__` method. Currently, when a list of hook functions is passed in the hooks dictionary, it wraps that list in another list unnecessarily, making the hooks uncallable.

Looking at the code, the issue is in how hooks are registered in `__init__`. The fix needs to handle both single hook functions and lists of hook functions properly.

Here's the fix:

```python
### requests/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        hooks = hooks or {}

        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)
=======
        hooks = hooks or {}

        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            if hasattr(v, '__iter__') and not isinstance(v, (str, bytes)):
                for hook in v:
                    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)
            else:
                self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Checks if the hook value is iterable (like a list) but not a string/bytes
2. If it is iterable, iterates through each hook function and registers them individually
3. If it's not iterable (i.e. a single function), registers it directly

This allows both single hook functions and lists of hook functions to work properly. For example:

```python
# This will now work:
hooks = {
    'response': [hook1, hook2, hook3],
    'pre_request': single_hook
}
request = Request(url='...', hooks=hooks)
```

The fix maintains proper indentation and handles both single hooks and multiple hooks per event type correctly.
