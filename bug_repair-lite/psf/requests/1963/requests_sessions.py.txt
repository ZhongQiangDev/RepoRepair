Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `Session.resolve_redirects` method which incorrectly copies the original request for each redirect, causing the HTTP method to be incorrectly preserved when it should be changed (e.g., when a 303 redirect changes POST to GET).

However, I notice that the `resolve_redirects` method is not shown in the provided code segment. The issue mentions it's part of `SessionRedirectMixin` which appears to be inherited by the `Session` class but is not shown in the file.

Without seeing the actual `resolve_redirects` implementation, I cannot provide the exact fix. The complete fix would need to:

1. Track the current request method through the redirect chain
2. Update the method appropriately based on redirect status codes (e.g., 303 changes to GET)
3. Use the current request's method rather than always copying from the original request

Could you please provide the code containing the `resolve_redirects` method implementation? This would likely be in a mixin or parent class file. Once I can see that code, I can provide the specific *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit needed to fix this issue.

The fix would likely involve modifying how the request is copied and ensuring the HTTP method is properly updated based on the redirect status code, particularly for 303 redirects which should convert any method to GET for subsequent requests.
