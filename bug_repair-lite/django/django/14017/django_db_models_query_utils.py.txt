Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when trying to combine a Q object with an Exists object using the & operator in the order `Q() & Exists(...)`. The error shows that the Q class's `_combine()` method strictly checks if the other operand is a Q instance, which prevents it from working with Exists objects.

However, `Exists(...) & Q()` works because the Exists class likely has proper handling for Q objects in its `__rand__` method. To make the operation commutative, we need to modify the Q class to handle Exists objects in the `_combine()` method.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/models/query_utils.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _combine(self, other, conn):
        if not isinstance(other, Q):
            raise TypeError(other)

        # If the other Q() is empty, ignore it and just use `self`.
        if not other:
            _, args, kwargs = self.deconstruct()
            return type(self)(*args, **kwargs)
        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.
        elif not self:
            _, args, kwargs = other.deconstruct()
            return type(other)(*args, **kwargs)
=======
    def _combine(self, other, conn):
        if hasattr(other, 'resolve_expression'):
            obj = type(self)()
            obj.connector = conn
            obj.add(self, conn)
            obj.add(other, conn)
            return obj
        elif not isinstance(other, Q):
            raise TypeError(other)

        # If the other Q() is empty, ignore it and just use `self`.
        if not other:
            _, args, kwargs = self.deconstruct()
            return type(self)(*args, **kwargs)
        # Or if this Q is empty, ignore it and just use `other`.
        elif not self:
            _, args, kwargs = other.deconstruct()
            return type(other)(*args, **kwargs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Checks if the other operand has a `resolve_expression` method (which both Q and Exists objects have)
2. If it does, creates a new Q object combining both operands without type checking
3. If not, falls back to the original behavior of requiring a Q instance

This change allows Q objects to be combined with Exists objects in either order while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code that combines Q objects with each other.

The fix makes the & operator commutative for Q-Exists pairs by allowing any object that has a `resolve_expression` method to be combined with a Q object, which includes both Q and Exists objects.
