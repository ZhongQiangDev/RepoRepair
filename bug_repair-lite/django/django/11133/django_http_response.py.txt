Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `HttpResponse` class's content handling, specifically when dealing with memoryview objects. The current implementation doesn't properly handle memoryview objects, causing them to be converted to their string representation rather than their actual content.

The fix needs to be in the `make_bytes` method of the `HttpResponseBase` class, where we should add special handling for memoryview objects. Here's the fix:

```python
### django/http/response.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def make_bytes(self, value):
        """Turn a value into a bytestring encoded in the output charset."""
        # Per PEP 3333, this response body must be bytes. To avoid returning
        # an instance of a subclass, this function returns `bytes(value)`.
        # This doesn't make a copy when `value` already contains bytes.

        # Handle string types -- we can't rely on force_bytes here because:
        # - Python attempts str conversion first
        # - when self._charset != 'utf-8' it re-encodes the content
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            return bytes(value)
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return bytes(value.encode(self.charset))
        # Handle non-string types.
        return str(value).encode(self.charset)

        if isinstance(value, (bytes, memoryview)):
            return bytes(value)
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return bytes(value.encode(self.charset))
        # Handle non-string types.
        return str(value).encode(self.charset)

```

This fix:
1. Adds `memoryview` to the check for bytes-like objects
2. Uses `bytes(value)` to properly convert the memoryview to bytes, which will preserve the actual content rather than converting it to a string representation

The fix ensures that when a memoryview object is passed to HttpResponse, it will be properly converted to bytes, maintaining the actual content rather than converting it to a string representation of the memoryview object.

This addresses the issue shown in the example where `HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))` was incorrectly outputting `b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'` instead of the expected `b'My Content'`.
