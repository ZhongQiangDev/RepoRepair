Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `has_key` method of `FileBasedCache`. The issue is a race condition where the file could be deleted between checking its existence with `os.path.exists()` and opening it with `open()`. This can happen especially when multiple threads try to access an expired cache entry simultaneously, since `_is_expired()` deletes expired files.

To fix this, we should handle the `FileNotFoundError` exception that could occur when opening the file, similar to how it's handled in other methods like `get()` and `delete()`. Here's the fix:

```python
### django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def has_key(self, key, version=None):
        fname = self._key_to_file(key, version)
        if os.path.exists(fname):
            with open(fname, "rb") as f:
                return not self._is_expired(f)
        return False
=======
    def has_key(self, key, version=None):
        fname = self._key_to_file(key, version)
        try:
            with open(fname, "rb") as f:
                return not self._is_expired(f)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix:
1. Removes the `os.path.exists()` check since it's redundant and prone to race conditions
2. Wraps the file operations in a try-except block to handle `FileNotFoundError`
3. Returns `False` if the file doesn't exist or can't be opened

This approach is more robust because it:
- Eliminates the race condition window between existence check and file open
- Handles the case where the file is deleted by another thread/process
- Matches the error handling pattern used in other methods of the class
- Is more efficient by avoiding an extra filesystem check (`exists()`)
