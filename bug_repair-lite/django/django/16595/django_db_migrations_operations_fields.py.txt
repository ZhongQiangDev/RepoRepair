Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `AlterField.reduce()` method where it doesn't handle the case of multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations on the same field. The optimizer should be able to reduce multiple `AlterField` operations into just the last one since it represents the final state.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if isinstance(operation, RemoveField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
            operation
        ):
            return [operation]
        elif (
            isinstance(operation, RenameField)
            and self.is_same_field_operation(operation)
            and self.field.db_column is None
        ):
            return [
                operation,
                AlterField(
                    model_name=self.model_name,
                    name=operation.new_name,
                    field=self.field,
                ),
            ]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)
=======
    def reduce(self, operation, app_label):
        if isinstance(operation, RemoveField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
            operation
        ):
            return [operation]
        elif (
            isinstance(operation, RenameField)
            and self.is_same_field_operation(operation)
            and self.field.db_column is None
        ):
            return [
                operation,
                AlterField(
                    model_name=self.model_name,
                    name=operation.new_name,
                    field=self.field,
                ),
            ]
        elif isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(
            operation
        ):
            return [operation]
        return super().reduce(operation, app_label)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new condition to check if the operation is an `AlterField` on the same field. If so, it returns just the later operation since it represents the final desired state of the field. This matches the behavior seen when an `AddField` is followed by `AlterField` operations.

The fix allows the optimizer to reduce multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations on the same field into just the last one, which is more efficient and matches the expected behavior described in the issue.
