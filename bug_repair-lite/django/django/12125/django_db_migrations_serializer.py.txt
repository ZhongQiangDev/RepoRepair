Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `_serialize_path` method of `DeconstructableSerializer` class in django/db/migrations/serializer.py. The method doesn't properly handle inner classes when serializing paths, causing it to incorrectly reference inner classes as if they were top-level classes.

The fix needs to modify `_serialize_path` to preserve the full path for inner classes while still handling the django.db.models special case. Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/migrations/serializer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @staticmethod
    def _serialize_path(path):
        module, name = path.rsplit(".", 1)
        if module == "django.db.models":
            imports = {"from django.db import models"}
            name = "models.%s" % name
        else:
            imports = {"import %s" % module}
            name = path
        return name, imports
=======
    @staticmethod
    def _serialize_path(path):
        # Split on the last occurrence of "." that's before any inner class dots
        parts = path.split('.')
        for i in range(len(parts)-1, 0, -1):
            module = '.'.join(parts[:i])
            name = '.'.join(parts[i:])
            if module == "django.db.models":
                imports = {"from django.db import models"}
                name = "models.%s" % name
                break
            elif not any(c.isupper() for c in module.split('.')[-1]):
                imports = {"import %s" % module}
                name = path
                break
        return name, imports
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Splits the path into parts and iterates from right to left
2. Looks for the appropriate module/name split point by checking if:
   - It's the django.db.models special case
   - The last component of the potential module doesn't contain uppercase letters (indicating it's not a class name)
3. Preserves the full path including inner class names while still handling the django.db.models special case correctly

For example:
- For `test1.models.Thing.State`, it will import `test1.models` and keep the full `test1.models.Thing.State` path
- For `django.db.models.CharField`, it will still convert to `models.CharField` as before

This should fix the issue where inner class paths were being incorrectly truncated in the migration files.
