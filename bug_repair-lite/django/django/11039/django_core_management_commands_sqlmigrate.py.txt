Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is only set based on `migration.atomic` without considering whether the database connection supports transactional DDL (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`).

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations
        self.output_transaction = migration.atomic

        # Make a plan that represents just the requested migrations and show SQL
=======
        # Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations and if the
        # database supports transactional DDL
        self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl

        # Make a plan that represents just the requested migrations and show SQL
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Adds a check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` in conjunction with `migration.atomic`
2. Only sets `self.output_transaction` to True if both conditions are met
3. Maintains proper indentation (8 spaces before each line)
4. Adds a more descriptive comment explaining both conditions

This change ensures that BEGIN/COMMIT statements are only added when both:
- The migration is marked as atomic
- The database actually supports transactional DDL

This addresses the issue where sqlmigrate was incorrectly wrapping migrations in transactions for databases that don't support transactional DDL.
