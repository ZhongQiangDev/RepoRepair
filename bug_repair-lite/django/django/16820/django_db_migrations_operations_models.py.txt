Based on the issue description, the problem is related to transitioning from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes` to remove deprecation warnings. Looking at the code, the `AlterIndexTogether` class needs to be modified to handle this transition.

The fix should modify the `AlterIndexTogether` class to convert `index_together` tuples into proper index objects that can be used with the newer `indexes` attribute. Here's the proposed fix:

```python
### django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):
    """
    Change the value of index_together to the target one.
    Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.
    """

    option_name = "index_together"

    def __init__(self, name, index_together):
        super().__init__(name, index_together)
=======
class AlterIndexTogether(AlterTogetherOptionOperation):
    """
    Change the value of index_together to the target one.
    Input value of index_together must be a set of tuples.
    """

    option_name = "index_together"

    def __init__(self, name, index_together):
        super().__init__(name, index_together)
        self._deprecated = True

    def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):
        model_state = state.models[app_label, self.name_lower]
        if self.option_name in model_state.options:
            # Convert index_together to indexes
            indexes = []
            for fields in normalize_together(self.option_value):
                indexes.append(models.Index(fields=list(fields), name=f"idx_{'_'.join(fields)}"))
            model_state.options['indexes'] = indexes
            del model_state.options[self.option_name]
        state.reload_model(app_label, self.name_lower, delay=True)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Marks the operation as deprecated with `self._deprecated = True`
2. Overrides `state_forwards` to convert `index_together` tuples into proper `Index` objects
3. Removes the old `index_together` option and replaces it with the new `indexes` option
4. Automatically generates index names based on the field names

This will help remove the deprecation warnings by transitioning from the old `index_together` format to the new `indexes` format during migration squashing.
