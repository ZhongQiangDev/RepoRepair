Based on the issue description, the bug is that when a model has a UniqueConstraint, Django's makemigrations doesn't validate that the fields specified in the constraint actually exist in the model. This is inconsistent with the behavior of unique_together which does validate field existence.

Looking at the code, this validation should be added in the Model._check_constraints() method since that's where other constraint validations happen. We need to add field existence validation similar to how _check_local_fields() validates fields for unique_together.

Here's the fix:

```python

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds field existence validation for UniqueConstraints by:

1. Adding a new check after the database compatibility checks
2. Iterating through all constraints to find UniqueConstraints
3. Using the existing _check_local_fields() method to validate that the fields exist in the model
4. Adding any validation errors to the list of errors

The _check_local_fields() method already handles:
- Checking if fields exist
- Ensuring fields are local to the model
- Preventing use of ManyToManyFields
- Providing appropriate error messages

This makes UniqueConstraint field validation consistent with unique_together validation.
