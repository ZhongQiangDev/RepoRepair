Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in the `iter_modules_and_files()` function where `Path.resolve()` is encountering embedded null bytes when resolving paths. The issue specifically mentions problems with pathlib's handling of certain paths, particularly around system paths like `/Users`.

The fix should handle potential null bytes more gracefully by using `os.path` operations instead of `pathlib` for critical path resolution. Here's the proposed fix:

```python
### django/utils/autoreload.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    results = set()
    for filename in itertools.chain(sys_file_paths, extra_files):
        if not filename:
            continue
        path = Path(filename)
        try:
            resolved_path = path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # The module could have been removed, don't fail loudly if this
            # is the case.
            continue
        results.add(resolved_path)
    return frozenset(results)

    results = set()
    for filename in itertools.chain(sys_file_paths, extra_files):
        if not filename:
            continue
        try:
            # Use os.path instead of pathlib to avoid null byte issues
            real_path = os.path.realpath(filename)
            abs_path = os.path.abspath(real_path)
            # Convert back to Path object only after resolving
            resolved_path = Path(abs_path)
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError):
            # Handle both missing files and invalid paths (including null bytes)
            continue
        results.add(resolved_path)
    return frozenset(results)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Replaces `Path.resolve()` with `os.path.realpath()` and `os.path.abspath()` which are more robust against path issues
2. Only converts to a Path object after resolving the path using os.path functions
3. Catches ValueError in addition to FileNotFoundError to handle null byte errors
4. Maintains the same interface by returning Path objects in the results set

The change should resolve the intermittent "ValueError: embedded null byte" errors while maintaining compatibility with the rest of the autoreloader code that expects Path objects.
