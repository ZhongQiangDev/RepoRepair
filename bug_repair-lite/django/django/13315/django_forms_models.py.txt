Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be related to duplicate options appearing in form fields when using `limit_choices_to` with Q objects on ForeignKey fields involving joins. The issue likely stems from how the queryset is filtered in the `apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield` function.

The current implementation uses `complex_filter()` which may not properly handle deduplication when dealing with joins. We should modify the queryset to ensure uniqueness by adding `.distinct()` after applying the filter.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/forms/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield(formfield):
    """Apply limit_choices_to to the formfield's queryset if needed."""
    if hasattr(formfield, 'queryset') and hasattr(formfield, 'get_limit_choices_to'):
        limit_choices_to = formfield.get_limit_choices_to()
        if limit_choices_to is not None:
            formfield.queryset = formfield.queryset.complex_filter(limit_choices_to)
=======
def apply_limit_choices_to_to_formfield(formfield):
    """Apply limit_choices_to to the formfield's queryset if needed."""
    if hasattr(formfield, 'queryset') and hasattr(formfield, 'get_limit_choices_to'):
        limit_choices_to = formfield.get_limit_choices_to()
        if limit_choices_to is not None:
            formfield.queryset = formfield.queryset.complex_filter(limit_choices_to).distinct()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds `.distinct()` after applying the complex filter to ensure that duplicate entries are removed from the queryset. This is particularly important when dealing with queries that involve joins, as these can sometimes produce duplicate results when filtering with Q objects.

The `.distinct()` call will ensure that only unique records are returned, regardless of how the joins and filters are applied, thus preventing duplicate options from appearing in the form field.
