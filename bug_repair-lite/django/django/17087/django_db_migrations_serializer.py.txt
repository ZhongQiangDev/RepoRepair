Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `FunctionTypeSerializer.serialize()` method where it doesn't properly handle class methods from nested classes. When serializing a class method from a nested class (like `Capability.default` inside `Profile`), it's not including the parent class name in the path.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/migrations/serializer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            klass = self.value.__self__
            module = klass.__module__
            return "%s.%s.%s" % (module, klass.__name__, self.value.__name__), {
                "import %s" % module
            }
=======
            klass = self.value.__self__
            module = klass.__module__
            # Get the full qualified name including parent classes
            class_path = klass.__qualname__
            return "%s.%s.%s" % (module, class_path, self.value.__name__), {
                "import %s" % module
            }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change uses `__qualname__` instead of `__name__` to get the full qualified name of the class, which includes any parent classes. For the example in the issue, this would correctly generate `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default` instead of `appname.models.Capability.default`.

The `__qualname__` attribute was introduced in Python 3.3 specifically to handle nested class names. It contains the dot-separated path of the class from the module's global scope, which is exactly what we need in this case.

This fix ensures that class methods from nested classes are properly serialized with their complete path, allowing them to be correctly used as default values in model fields.
