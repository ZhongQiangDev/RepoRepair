Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `RenameModel` operation where it doesn't handle the case when a model already has a custom `db_table` defined. In such cases, it should be a no-op since the table name isn't actually changing.

The fix needs to be made in the `database_forwards` method of the `RenameModel` class. We need to check if the old and new table names are the same before performing any operations.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):
        new_model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.new_name)
        if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, new_model):
            old_model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.old_name)
            # Move the main table
            schema_editor.alter_db_table(
                new_model,
                old_model._meta.db_table,
                new_model._meta.db_table,
            )
=======
    def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):
        new_model = to_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.new_name)
        if self.allow_migrate_model(schema_editor.connection.alias, new_model):
            old_model = from_state.apps.get_model(app_label, self.old_name)
            # Skip table rename if old and new tables are identical
            old_db_table = old_model._meta.db_table
            new_db_table = new_model._meta.db_table
            if old_db_table != new_db_table:
                # Move the main table
                schema_editor.alter_db_table(
                    new_model,
                    old_db_table,
                    new_db_table,
                )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a check to compare the old and new table names before attempting to rename the table. If they're the same (which would be the case when a custom `db_table` is defined), it skips the table rename operation.

The rest of the method should continue executing to handle related fields and M2M tables, as those still need to be updated even if the main table name doesn't change.

This fix prevents unnecessary table recreation in SQLite and avoids dropping/recreating foreign key constraints in PostgreSQL when the table name isn't actually changing.
