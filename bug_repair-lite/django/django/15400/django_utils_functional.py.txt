Based on the issue description, the bug is that `SimpleLazyObject` is missing the `__radd__` implementation, which is needed for reverse addition operations (when the lazy object is on the right side of the + operator).

The fix needs to be added to the `SimpleLazyObject` class in django/utils/functional.py. Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to implement the `__radd__` method as suggested in the issue:

```python
### django/utils/functional.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            # We have to use SimpleLazyObject, not self.__class__, because the
            # latter is proxied.
            result = SimpleLazyObject(self._setupfunc)
            memo[id(self)] = result
            return result
        return copy.deepcopy(self._wrapped, memo)


=======
    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            # We have to use SimpleLazyObject, not self.__class__, because the
            # latter is proxied.
            result = SimpleLazyObject(self._setupfunc)
            memo[id(self)] = result
            return result
        return copy.deepcopy(self._wrapped, memo)

    def __radd__(self, other):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            self._setup()
        return other + self._wrapped

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the `__radd__` method to the `SimpleLazyObject` class, implementing it exactly as suggested in the issue. The implementation:

1. Checks if the wrapped object is not yet initialized
2. If not initialized, calls `_setup()` to initialize it
3. Returns the result of adding the other object to the wrapped object

This allows the `SimpleLazyObject` to properly handle cases where it appears on the right side of the + operator, like in expressions such as `5 + lazy_object`.

The indentation matches the class's existing method indentation (8 spaces for method definitions within the class), maintaining consistency with the codebase's style.
