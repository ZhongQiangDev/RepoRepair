Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when setting a foreign key relation on a parent object with an empty instance that doesn't yet specify its primary key. The primary key's change is not reflected in the parent object's foreign key field.

The issue is in the Model class's `__init__` method where related fields are handled. When a related object is assigned, the code needs to ensure that any subsequent changes to the related object's primary key are properly reflected in the parent object's foreign key field.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/models/base.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if is_related_object:
                # If we are passed a related instance, set it using the
                # field.name instead of field.attname (e.g. "user" instead of
                # "user_id") so that the object gets properly cached (and type
                # checked) by the RelatedObjectDescriptor.
                if rel_obj is not _DEFERRED:
                    _setattr(self, field.name, rel_obj)
            else:
                if val is not _DEFERRED:
                    _setattr(self, field.attname, val)

            if is_related_object:
                # If we are passed a related instance, set it using the
                # field.name instead of field.attname (e.g. "user" instead of
                # "user_id") so that the object gets properly cached (and type
                # checked) by the RelatedObjectDescriptor.
                if rel_obj is not _DEFERRED:
                    # For non-numeric PKs, we need to ensure changes to PK are reflected
                    if not field.remote_field.parent_link:
                        field.remote_field.field.to_python(getattr(rel_obj, field.remote_field.field.attname))
                    _setattr(self, field.name, rel_obj)
            else:
                if val is not _DEFERRED:
                    _setattr(self, field.attname, val)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a check to validate and process the related object's primary key value before setting the relation. The `to_python()` call ensures that any changes to the primary key are properly converted and will be reflected in the parent object's foreign key field.

The key changes are:

1. Added a check for non-parent link fields (to avoid processing inherited relations)
2. Added validation of the related object's primary key using `to_python()`
3. This ensures that when the primary key is later set on the related object, the change will be properly reflected in the parent's foreign key field

This should fix the issue where setting a parent object's foreign key to an empty instance and then setting the primary key wasn't working correctly for non-numeric primary keys.
