Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `handle` method where `exec()` is called without providing a globals dictionary, causing variables defined in the executed code to not be properly scoped. This leads to the `NameError: name 'django' is not defined` error when trying to access imported modules within functions.

Here's the fix using SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```python
### django/core/management/commands/shell.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def handle(self, **options):
        # Execute the command and exit.
        if options['command']:
            exec(options['command'])
            return

        # Execute stdin if it has anything to read and exit.
        # Not supported on Windows due to select.select() limitations.
        if sys.platform != 'win32' and not sys.stdin.isatty() and select.select([sys.stdin], [], [], 0)[0]:
            exec(sys.stdin.read())
            return
=======
    def handle(self, **options):
        # Set up a dictionary to serve as the environment for the shell
        imported_objects = {}

        # Execute the command and exit.
        if options['command']:
            exec(options['command'], imported_objects)
            return

        # Execute stdin if it has anything to read and exit.
        # Not supported on Windows due to select.select() limitations.
        if sys.platform != 'win32' and not sys.stdin.isatty() and select.select([sys.stdin], [], [], 0)[0]:
            exec(sys.stdin.read(), imported_objects)
            return
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix:
1. Creates an `imported_objects` dictionary to serve as the globals namespace
2. Passes this dictionary as the second argument to both `exec()` calls
3. This ensures that imports and variable definitions within the executed code are properly scoped and accessible within functions

This matches the behavior of the interactive Python shell where imports and variables are properly maintained in the global namespace. The fix allows the example code from the issue to work correctly, as the `django` import will be properly scoped and accessible within the `f()` function.
