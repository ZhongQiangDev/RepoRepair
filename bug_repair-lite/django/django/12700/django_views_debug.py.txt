Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `cleanse_setting` method of `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class. The current implementation only handles dictionaries recursively but doesn't handle other iterables like lists, which means sensitive data in nested lists remains uncleansed.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/views/debug.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def cleanse_setting(self, key, value):
        """
        Cleanse an individual setting key/value of sensitive content. If the
        value is a dictionary, recursively cleanse the keys in that dictionary.
        """
        try:
            if self.hidden_settings.search(key):
                cleansed = self.cleansed_substitute
            elif isinstance(value, dict):
                cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}
            else:
                cleansed = value
        except TypeError:
            # If the key isn't regex-able, just return as-is.
            cleansed = value

        if callable(cleansed):
            cleansed = CallableSettingWrapper(cleansed)

        return cleansed
=======
    def cleanse_setting(self, key, value):
        """
        Cleanse an individual setting key/value of sensitive content. If the
        value is a dictionary or iterable, recursively cleanse the keys and values.
        """
        try:
            if self.hidden_settings.search(key):
                cleansed = self.cleansed_substitute
            elif isinstance(value, dict):
                cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}
            elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
                cleansed = [self.cleanse_setting(key, v) for v in value]
            else:
                cleansed = value
        except TypeError:
            # If the key isn't regex-able, just return as-is.
            cleansed = value

        if callable(cleansed):
            cleansed = CallableSettingWrapper(cleansed)

        return cleansed
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The changes:
1. Added handling for list and tuple types using `isinstance(value, (list, tuple))`
2. For lists/tuples, recursively cleanse each value while maintaining the same key context
3. Updated the docstring to reflect that we now handle iterables as well
4. Maintained proper indentation and structure of the original code

This fix will now properly cleanse sensitive data in nested lists and tuples, addressing the issue shown in the example where sensitive data in nested structures was being exposed.
