Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `MultiWidget` class's `id_for_label` method. The issue states that the method automatically appends '_0' to label IDs, which is not always desired behavior. The suggestion is to remove this method entirely since child classes like `ChoiceWidget` can implement their own ID handling.

Here's the fix to remove the `id_for_label` method from `MultiWidget`:

```python
### django/forms/widgets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def id_for_label(self, id_):
        if id_:
            id_ += '_0'
        return id_

    def value_from_datadict(self, data, files, name):
=======
    def value_from_datadict(self, data, files, name):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit removes the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class entirely. By removing this method, the class will inherit the default `id_for_label` implementation from the base `Widget` class, which simply returns the ID as-is without modification.

This change allows subclasses like `ChoiceWidget` to handle their own ID formatting as needed through their own `id_for_label` implementations, rather than forcing all `MultiWidget` subclasses to append '_0' to their IDs.
