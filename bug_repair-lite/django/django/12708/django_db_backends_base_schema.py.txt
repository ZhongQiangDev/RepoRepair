I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue occurs when trying to delete an `index_together` if there's also a `unique_together` on the same fields. The error happens in the `_delete_composed_index` method, which finds both the unique constraint and the index constraint when it's only expecting to find one.

Looking at the error message:
> ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one.

The problem is in the `_delete_composed_index` method. When it tries to find constraints for the columns, it doesn't exclude unique constraints when looking for indexes (or vice versa). This causes it to find both constraints when it's only expecting one.

## Fix

We need to modify the `_delete_composed_index` method to properly filter constraints based on the type we're looking for:

```python
### django/db/backends/base/schema.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
            model, columns, exclude=meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names,
            **constraint_kwargs
        )
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))
=======
    def _delete_composed_index(self, model, fields, constraint_kwargs, sql):
        meta_constraint_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.constraints}
        meta_index_names = {constraint.name for constraint in model._meta.indexes}
        columns = [model._meta.get_field(field).column for field in fields]
        
        # Filter constraints based on type - if we're looking for an index, exclude unique constraints and vice versa
        exclusions = meta_constraint_names | meta_index_names
        if constraint_kwargs.get('index'):
            constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
                model, columns, exclude=exclusions, index=True, unique=False
            )
        elif constraint_kwargs.get('unique'):
            constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
                model, columns, exclude=exclusions, unique=True
            )
        else:
            constraint_names = self._constraint_names(
                model, columns, exclude=exclusions, **constraint_kwargs
            )
            
        if len(constraint_names) != 1:
            raise ValueError("Found wrong number (%s) of constraints for %s(%s)" % (
                len(constraint_names),
                model._meta.db_table,
                ", ".join(columns),
            ))
        self.execute(self._delete_constraint_sql(sql, model, constraint_names[0]))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the `_delete_composed_index` method to be more specific about the type of constraint it's looking for. When looking for an index, it explicitly excludes unique constraints, and when looking for a unique constraint, it explicitly looks for unique constraints. This prevents the method from finding both types when we only want one.
