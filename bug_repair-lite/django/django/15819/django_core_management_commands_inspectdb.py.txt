Based on the issue description, the bug is that Django's `inspectdb` command doesn't generate `related_name` parameters for foreign key fields that point to the same model, which causes reverse accessor name clashes.

The fix needs to be implemented in the part where foreign key fields are generated. Looking at the code, this happens in the `handle_inspection` method where it processes relations. We need to modify the code to add `related_name` when a relation points to the same table.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                        rel_to = (
                            "self"
                            if ref_db_table == table_name
                            else table2model(ref_db_table)
                        )
                        if rel_to in known_models:
                            field_type = "%s(%s" % (rel_type, rel_to)
                        else:
                            field_type = "%s('%s'" % (rel_type, rel_to)
=======
                        rel_to = (
                            "self"
                            if ref_db_table == table_name
                            else table2model(ref_db_table)
                        )
                        if rel_to == "self":
                            extra_params["related_name"] = "%s_%s" % (att_name, table_name.lower())
                        if rel_to in known_models:
                            field_type = "%s(%s" % (rel_type, rel_to)
                        else:
                            field_type = "%s('%s'" % (rel_type, rel_to)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a `related_name` parameter when a foreign key or one-to-one field references the same table (self-reference). The `related_name` is constructed using the field name and table name to ensure uniqueness.

For example, if you have a table "Person" with two self-referencing fields "manager" and "assistant", it will generate:

```python
manager = models.ForeignKey('self', related_name='manager_person', ...)
assistant = models.ForeignKey('self', related_name='assistant_person', ...)
```

This prevents the reverse accessor clash mentioned in the issue by giving each relation a unique related name.
