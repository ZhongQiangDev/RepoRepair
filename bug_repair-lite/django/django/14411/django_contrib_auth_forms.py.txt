Based on the issue description, the bug is related to the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` having a label with a 'for' attribute pointing to a non-labelable element, since the widget just renders text rather than an input element.

However, in the provided code segment from `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`, I don't see the actual `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` class definition - I only see the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class that uses this widget. The bug would be in the widget class implementation.

Since the actual widget code is not provided in the snippets, I cannot generate a specific SEARCH/REPLACE edit. The fix would need to be in the widget class implementation, likely removing the 'for' attribute from the label rendering.

If you could provide the code for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` class (which might be in another file), I could generate the specific edit needed to fix this issue. The fix would likely involve modifying how the widget renders its template to either:

1. Remove the 'for' attribute from the label element entirely
2. Or change the widget to render an actual form control that can be properly labeled

Could you please provide the code for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` class?
