Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `deserialize_db_from_string` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`. The issue is that when deserializing objects with foreign key relationships, saving them without a transaction can cause integrity errors if objects are saved in the wrong order.

The fix is to wrap the deserialization and saving in a transaction, similar to how the `loaddata` command handles it. Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix this:

```python
### django/db/backends/base/creation.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def deserialize_db_from_string(self, data):
        """
        Reload the database with data from a string generated by
        the serialize_db_to_string() method.
        """
        data = StringIO(data)
        for obj in serializers.deserialize("json", data, using=self.connection.alias):
            obj.save()
=======
    def deserialize_db_from_string(self, data):
        """
        Reload the database with data from a string generated by
        the serialize_db_to_string() method.
        """
        data = StringIO(data)
        from django.db import transaction
        with transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):
            for obj in serializers.deserialize("json", data, using=self.connection.alias):
                obj.save()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Imports the transaction module from django.db
2. Wraps the deserialization and saving in a transaction.atomic() block
3. Ensures all objects are saved atomically, preventing integrity errors from foreign key constraints

The transaction ensures that either all objects are saved successfully or none are saved at all, maintaining database consistency regardless of the order in which objects with foreign key relationships are processed.
