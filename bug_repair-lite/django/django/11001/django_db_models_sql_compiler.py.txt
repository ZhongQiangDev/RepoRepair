I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is in the `get_order_by` method of the `SQLCompiler` class. When using multiline `RawSQL` expressions in `order_by`, the compiler incorrectly identifies duplicate ordering clauses.

The problem occurs because the regular expression `self.ordering_parts` is applied to the SQL string that may contain newlines. When it extracts the "without_ordering" part, it only captures a single line of the SQL statement (the line containing "ASC" or "DESC"). This causes different `RawSQL` expressions with identical last lines to be incorrectly identified as duplicates, resulting in some ordering clauses being removed.

The issue can be fixed by replacing newlines with spaces in the SQL string before applying the regular expression, as suggested in the issue description.

## Fix

```python
### django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)
=======
            sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split())
            without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix replaces all whitespace (including newlines) with a single space before applying the regular expression. This ensures that multiline SQL statements are properly handled when checking for duplicate ordering clauses.
