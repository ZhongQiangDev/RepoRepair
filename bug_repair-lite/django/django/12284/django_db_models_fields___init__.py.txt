Based on the issue description, the bug is in how `get_FOO_display()` handles choices in inherited models. The issue occurs when a child model extends the choices of its parent model - the display method doesn't properly handle the additional choices.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `Field` class's `contribute_to_class()` method. When a field with choices is added to a model, it creates a `get_FOO_display` method, but this method doesn't properly handle inheritance of choices.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.choices is not None:
            if not hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name):
                setattr(
                    cls,
                    'get_%s_display' % self.name,
                    partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self),
                )
=======
        if self.choices is not None:
            # Always recreate the display method to handle inheritance properly
            setattr(
                cls,
                'get_%s_display' % self.name,
                partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self),
            )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix removes the check for whether the display method already exists and always creates it. This ensures that when a child model overrides the choices, the display method will use the updated choices rather than inheriting the parent's method that uses the old choices.

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `if not hasattr()` check that prevented overriding existing display methods
2. Always set the display method to ensure it uses the current field's choices

This allows child models to properly override their parent's choices and have the display method work correctly with the new choices.
