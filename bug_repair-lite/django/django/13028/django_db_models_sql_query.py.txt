Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when filtering on a field named "filterable" in Django's query system. The error message indicates that Django is incorrectly interpreting the field name "filterable" as a special flag rather than a regular field name.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `check_filterable()` method in django/db/models/sql/query.py. This method checks if expressions can be used in WHERE clauses by looking at a `filterable` attribute. However, it's incorrectly interpreting field names that happen to be "filterable" as this special attribute.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/models/sql/query.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def check_filterable(self, expression):
        """Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause."""
        if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):
            raise NotSupportedError(
                expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '
                'clause.'
            )
        if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):
            for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():
                self.check_filterable(expr)
=======
    def check_filterable(self, expression):
        """Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause."""
        if hasattr(expression, 'filterable') and not isinstance(expression, Field):
            if not expression.filterable:
                raise NotSupportedError(
                    expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '
                    'clause.'
                )
        if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):
            for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():
                self.check_filterable(expr)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:

1. Adds a check to see if the expression is a Field instance before checking the filterable attribute
2. Only raises the error if the expression has an explicit filterable=False attribute and is not a Field

This prevents Django from misinterpreting field names that happen to be "filterable" as the special filterable flag, while maintaining the original functionality for non-Field expressions that have the filterable attribute set to False.

The fix allows models to have fields named "filterable" while still maintaining Django's ability to restrict certain expressions from being used in WHERE clauses.
