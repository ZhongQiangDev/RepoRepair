Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in the migration autodetector's handling of unique_together constraints when converting a ForeignKey field to a ManyToManyField. The error occurs because the unique_together constraint needs to be removed before changing the field type.

The fix needs to be in the `generate_altered_fields()` method of `MigrationAutodetector` class, where we should handle the unique_together removal before field type changes.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    # We cannot alter between m2m and concrete fields
                    self._generate_removed_field(app_label, model_name, field_name)
                    self._generate_added_field(app_label, model_name, field_name)
=======
                    # We cannot alter between m2m and concrete fields
                    # First remove any unique_together containing this field
                    old_model_state = self.from_state.models[app_label, old_model_name]
                    unique_together = old_model_state.options.get("unique_together", None)
                    if unique_together:
                        for unique_fields in unique_together:
                            if field_name in unique_fields:
                                self.add_operation(
                                    app_label,
                                    operations.AlterUniqueTogether(
                                        name=model_name,
                                        unique_together=None,
                                    ),
                                )
                                break
                    # Then handle the field change
                    self._generate_removed_field(app_label, model_name, field_name)
                    self._generate_added_field(app_label, model_name, field_name)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:

1. Checks if there's a unique_together constraint containing the field being altered
2. If found, adds an operation to remove the unique_together constraint before changing the field
3. Then proceeds with the field type change operations

The fix ensures that unique_together constraints are properly removed before attempting to change a field from ForeignKey to ManyToManyField, which prevents the "Found wrong number of constraints" error.

This matches the workaround described in the issue where removing unique_together first, then changing the field type worked. But now it's handled automatically in a single migration.
