Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is added after `AddIndex` operation that includes the `_order` field, which hasn't been created yet. The fix needs to ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is generated before any index operations that reference the `_order` field.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the order of operations being generated in `_detect_changes()` method. The `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` is called after `generate_added_indexes()`, which causes the dependency issue.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/db/migrations/autodetector.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.generate_altered_unique_together()
        self.generate_altered_index_together()
        self.generate_added_indexes()
        self.generate_added_constraints()
        self.generate_altered_db_table()
        self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()
=======
        self.generate_altered_unique_together()
        self.generate_altered_index_together()
        self.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()
        self.generate_added_indexes()
        self.generate_added_constraints()
        self.generate_altered_db_table()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change moves `generate_altered_order_with_respect_to()` before `generate_added_indexes()` and `generate_added_constraints()`. This ensures that the `_order` field is created before any indexes that might reference it are created.

The fix works because:
1. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation creates the `_order` field
2. By moving it before index operations, we ensure the field exists before any indexes try to use it
3. This maintains proper dependency order while still preserving all functionality

This matches Django's operation dependency system where field creation must happen before index creation that references those fields.
