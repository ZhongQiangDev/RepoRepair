Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in the technical_404_response function in django/views/debug.py. The issue states that when DEBUG is True and Http404 is raised in a path converter's to_python method, it doesn't result in a proper technical response with debug information.

The problem is that the function doesn't properly handle the case where the exception doesn't have the expected structure in its args. When Http404 is raised from a path converter, it may not have the 'tried' and 'path' information in its args[0] dictionary.

Here's the fix that will make the function handle Http404 exceptions more gracefully:

```python
### django/views/debug.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    try:
        error_url = exception.args[0]['path']
    except (IndexError, TypeError, KeyError):
        error_url = request.path_info[1:]  # Trim leading slash

    try:
        tried = exception.args[0]['tried']
    except (IndexError, TypeError, KeyError):
        tried = []
    else:
        if (not tried or (                  # empty URLconf
            request.path == '/' and
            len(tried) == 1 and             # default URLconf
            len(tried[0]) == 1 and
            getattr(tried[0][0], 'app_name', '') == getattr(tried[0][0], 'namespace', '') == 'admin'
        )):
            return default_urlconf(request)
=======
    # Handle both dictionary-style and string-style Http404 exceptions
    if exception.args and isinstance(exception.args[0], dict):
        error_url = exception.args[0].get('path', request.path_info[1:])
        tried = exception.args[0].get('tried', [])
    else:
        error_url = request.path_info[1:]  # Trim leading slash
        tried = []

    if (not tried or (                  # empty URLconf
        request.path == '/' and
        len(tried) == 1 and             # default URLconf
        len(tried[0]) == 1 and
        getattr(tried[0][0], 'app_name', '') == getattr(tried[0][0], 'namespace', '') == 'admin'
    )):
        return default_urlconf(request)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Consolidates the two separate try-except blocks into a single more elegant solution
2. Uses dict.get() with defaults instead of try-except for cleaner code
3. Properly handles both dictionary-style Http404 exceptions (from URL resolver) and string-style Http404 exceptions (from path converters)
4. Maintains the same functionality for standard URL resolution failures while adding support for path converter Http404s

The fix will ensure that when Http404 is raised from a path converter's to_python method, Django will still display a proper technical 404 page with debug information when DEBUG=True, rather than showing a generic server error message.
