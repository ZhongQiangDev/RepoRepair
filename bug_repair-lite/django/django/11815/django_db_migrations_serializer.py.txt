Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `EnumSerializer` class in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`. The current implementation serializes the enum using its value instead of its name, which causes issues with translations since the value can change based on the language.

Here's the fix that changes the serialization to use the enum name instead of its value:

```python
### django/db/migrations/serializer.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def serialize(self):
        enum_class = self.value.__class__
        module = enum_class.__module__
        v_string, v_imports = serializer_factory(self.value.value).serialize()
        imports = {'import %s' % module, *v_imports}
        return "%s.%s(%s)" % (module, enum_class.__name__, v_string), imports
=======
    def serialize(self):
        enum_class = self.value.__class__
        module = enum_class.__module__
        name = self.value.name
        imports = {'import %s' % module}
        return "%s.%s['%s']" % (module, enum_class.__name__, name), imports
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Uses `self.value.name` to get the enum member's name (e.g., 'GOOD') instead of its value
2. Changes the serialization format from `Status(value)` to `Status['name']`
3. Removes the value serialization since we're using the name directly
4. Simplifies the imports since we don't need to serialize the value anymore

This fix ensures that migrations will use the enum member's name (which is constant) rather than its value (which can be translated), resolving the issue with translations breaking migrations.
