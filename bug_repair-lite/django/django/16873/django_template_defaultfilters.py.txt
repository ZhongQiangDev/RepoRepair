Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `join` filter implementation in `django/template/defaultfilters.py`. The issue is that when `autoescape` is off, the joining string (`arg`) is still being escaped when it shouldn't be.

The current implementation always calls `conditional_escape(arg)` regardless of the `autoescape` parameter. When `autoescape` is off, we should not escape the joining string.

Here's the fix:

```python
### django/template/defaultfilters.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
@register.filter(is_safe=True, needs_autoescape=True)
def join(value, arg, autoescape=True):
    """Join a list with a string, like Python's ``str.join(list)``."""
    try:
        if autoescape:
            value = [conditional_escape(v) for v in value]
        data = conditional_escape(arg).join(value)
    except TypeError:  # Fail silently if arg isn't iterable.
        return value
    return mark_safe(data)
=======
@register.filter(is_safe=True, needs_autoescape=True)
def join(value, arg, autoescape=True):
    """Join a list with a string, like Python's ``str.join(list)``."""
    try:
        if autoescape:
            value = [conditional_escape(v) for v in value]
            arg = conditional_escape(arg)
        data = arg.join(value)
    except TypeError:  # Fail silently if arg isn't iterable.
        return value
    return mark_safe(data)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key changes are:
1. Moved the `conditional_escape(arg)` inside the `if autoescape:` block
2. Only escape the joining string (`arg`) when `autoescape` is True

This change ensures that when `autoescape` is off, neither the list items nor the joining string will be escaped, which matches the expected behavior described in the issue.

The test case `test_join02` should now pass since the joining string `<br/>` will no longer be escaped to `&lt;br/&gt;` when `autoescape` is off.
