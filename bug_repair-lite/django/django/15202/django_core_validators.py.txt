Based on the issue description, the bug is in the URLValidator class where a ValueError is being raised from urlsplit() instead of being caught and converted to a ValidationError. The issue occurs when an invalid IPv6 URL is provided.

The fix should modify the try-except block in the URLValidator.__call__() method to catch ValueError and convert it to a ValidationError. Here's the fix:

```python
### django/core/validators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                try:
                    scheme, netloc, path, query, fragment = urlsplit(value)
                except ValueError:  # for example, "Invalid IPv6 URL"
                    raise ValidationError(self.message, code=self.code, params={'value': value})
=======
                try:
                    scheme, netloc, path, query, fragment = urlsplit(value)
                except (ValueError, ValidationError):  # for example, "Invalid IPv6 URL"
                    raise ValidationError(self.message, code=self.code, params={'value': value})
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that both ValueError and ValidationError exceptions from urlsplit() are caught and properly converted to a ValidationError with the appropriate message. This maintains consistent error handling behavior for invalid URLs, including malformed IPv6 addresses.

The fix is minimal but addresses the core issue by:
1. Adding ValidationError to the list of caught exceptions
2. Maintaining the same error message and code handling
3. Preserving the existing comment for clarity

This ensures that forms.URLField().clean() will consistently raise ValidationError instead of ValueError when given invalid URLs, which is the expected behavior for Django form fields.
