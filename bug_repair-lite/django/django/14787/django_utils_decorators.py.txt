Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when using `method_decorator` with a function decorator that expects the wrapped function to have standard function attributes like `__name__`. The issue is in the `_multi_decorate` function where we create a `bound_method` using `partial` but don't preserve the original function's attributes.

The fix is to update the `bound_method` with the original method's attributes before applying decorators. Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```python
### django/utils/decorators.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))
        for dec in decorators:
            bound_method = dec(bound_method)
        return bound_method(*args, **kwargs)
=======
        bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))
        # Preserve the original method's attributes on the partial object
        update_wrapper(bound_method, method)
        for dec in decorators:
            bound_method = dec(bound_method)
        return bound_method(*args, **kwargs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` after creating the partial object but before applying decorators. This ensures that the partial object has all the necessary attributes from the original method, such as `__name__`, `__module__`, etc.

The fix addresses the specific error in the issue where `AttributeError: 'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__name__'` was occurring. Now when decorators like the `logger` example try to access `func.__name__`, they will find the attribute properly copied from the original method.
