Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when passing empty lists/arrays to WCS transformations like `wcs.wcs_pix2world([], [], 0)`. The error suggests there's an issue handling empty arrays in the `_array_converter` method.

Looking at the code, I found that the `_array_converter` method needs to handle empty arrays properly. Here's the fix:

```python
### astropy/wcs/wcs.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            try:
                axes = np.broadcast_arrays(*axes)
            except ValueError:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Coordinate arrays are not broadcastable to each other")

            xy = np.hstack([x.reshape((x.size, 1)) for x in axes])
=======
            # Handle empty arrays
            if all(len(x) == 0 for x in axes):
                return [np.array([]) for _ in range(self.naxis)]
                
            try:
                axes = np.broadcast_arrays(*axes)
            except ValueError:
                raise ValueError(
                    "Coordinate arrays are not broadcastable to each other")

            xy = np.hstack([x.reshape((x.size, 1)) for x in axes]) 
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a check for empty arrays before attempting to broadcast and reshape them. If all input arrays are empty, it returns a list of empty numpy arrays matching the number of axes in the WCS.

The fix allows empty arrays to be handled gracefully rather than raising an error. This matches the expected behavior described in the issue where `wcs.wcs_pix2world([], [], 0)` should return empty lists/arrays rather than failing.

The proper indentation is maintained in the fix to match the surrounding code context.
