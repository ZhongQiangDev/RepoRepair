Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `from_file()` method of the `Config` class. The issue is that the method always opens files in text mode, but some file loaders (like `tomllib.load`) require binary mode.

The fix is to add a `mode` parameter to `from_file()` that allows specifying the file mode, defaulting to text mode for backward compatibility.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix this:

    ) -> bool:

        :param filename: The path to the data file. This can be an
            absolute path or relative to the config root path.

```

This change:
1. Adds a new `mode` parameter with default value `""`
2. Updates the docstring to document the new parameter and show an example with `tomllib`
3. Modifies the `open()` call to use the specified mode, prefixed with "r" for read mode
4. Maintains backward compatibility since the default empty mode string results in text mode

This allows users to specify binary mode when needed (e.g., for TOML files) while keeping the existing text mode behavior as the default.
