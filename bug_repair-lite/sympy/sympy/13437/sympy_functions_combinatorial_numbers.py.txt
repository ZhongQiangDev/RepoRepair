Based on the issue description, the bug is that `bell(n).limit(n,oo)` evaluates to `bell(oo)` instead of infinity. This needs to be fixed by implementing limit evaluation for the Bell numbers function.

The fix requires adding a `_eval_limit` method to the `bell` class to handle limits properly. The Bell numbers grow super-exponentially, so the limit as n approaches infinity should be infinity.

Here's the proposed fix:

```python
### sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _eval_rewrite_as_Sum(self, n, k_sym=None, symbols=None):
        from sympy import Sum
        if (k_sym is not None) or (symbols is not None):
            return self

        # Dobinski's formula
        if not n.is_nonnegative:
            return self
        k = Dummy('k', integer=True, nonnegative=True)
        return 1 / E * Sum(k**n / factorial(k), (k, 0, S.Infinity))

            return self

        # Dobinski's formula
        if not n.is_nonnegative:
            return self
        k = Dummy('k', integer=True, nonnegative=True)
        return 1 / E * Sum(k**n / factorial(k), (k, 0, S.Infinity))

    def _eval_limit(self, x, xlim, dir='+'):
        from sympy import oo
        if x.free_symbols and xlim == oo:
            return oo
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the `_eval_limit` method to the `bell` class. When evaluating the limit of `bell(n)` as n approaches infinity, it returns infinity (`oo`). The check `x.free_symbols` ensures we only handle limits involving the function's variable.

The fix follows the pattern used for other similar functions like Fibonacci numbers, where limits to infinity are properly evaluated. This makes the behavior consistent across all such number-theoretic functions in SymPy.
