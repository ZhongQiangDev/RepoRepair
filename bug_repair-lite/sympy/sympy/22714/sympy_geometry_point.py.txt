Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when trying to create a Point2D with `evaluate(False)` using `sp.S('Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))')`. The error message indicates that it's incorrectly detecting imaginary coordinates when they are actually real integers.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `Point.__new__` method where it checks for imaginary coordinates. The check `if any(a.is_number and im(a) for a in coords)` is too aggressive - it's checking if coordinates are imaginary before they are properly evaluated.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/geometry/point.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if any(a.is_number and im(a) for a in coords):
            raise ValueError('Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.')
        if not all(isinstance(a, Expr) for a in coords):
            raise TypeError('Coordinates must be valid SymPy expressions.')
=======
        if not all(isinstance(a, Expr) for a in coords):
            raise TypeError('Coordinates must be valid SymPy expressions.')
        if evaluate and any(a.is_number and im(a) for a in coords):
            raise ValueError('Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix moves the imaginary coordinate check after the expression type check and only performs it when `evaluate=True`. This allows unevaluated expressions to pass through without triggering the imaginary coordinate check prematurely.

The key changes are:
1. Reordered the checks so type checking happens first
2. Added `evaluate and` condition to the imaginary check so it only runs when evaluation is enabled

This should allow `sp.S('Point2D(Integer(1),Integer(2))')` to work properly with `evaluate(False)` since the imaginary coordinate check will be skipped in that case.
