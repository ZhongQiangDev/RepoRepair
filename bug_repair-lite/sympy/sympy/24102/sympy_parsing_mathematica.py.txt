Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in the new `parse_mathematica` function's handling of Greek characters like 'Î»'. The issue shows that while the old `mathematica` function could handle these characters, the new `parse_mathematica` function fails with a syntax error.

However, in the provided code segment, I don't see the actual `parse_mathematica` function implementation - only the deprecated `mathematica` function is shown. Without seeing the implementation of `parse_mathematica`, I cannot provide a specific fix.

To properly fix this issue, I would need to see:

1. The implementation of `parse_mathematica` function
2. The lexer/parser code that handles character parsing
3. Any character mapping or translation tables used by the parser

Could you please provide the relevant code sections that contain the `parse_mathematica` implementation and related parsing logic? This would allow me to identify exactly where the Greek character handling is failing and provide appropriate *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to fix the issue.

The fix would likely involve either:
1. Adding proper Unicode character handling in the lexer/parser
2. Adding Greek character mappings to the parser's symbol table
3. Fixing character encoding issues in the parsing pipeline

Please share the additional code sections so I can provide a specific fix.
