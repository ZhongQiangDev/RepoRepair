Based on the issue description, the problem appears to be that trigonometric simplification is not working properly for rational number arguments. Specifically, expressions like `sin(Rational(1,50))*sin(Rational(1,25)) + cos(Rational(1,50))*cos(Rational(1,25))` are not being simplified to `cos(Rational(1,50) - Rational(1,25))`.

Looking at the code in sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py, the issue seems to be in the `_trigsimp` function where it's not properly handling rational number arguments in trigonometric expressions. The function needs to be modified to handle rational numbers in the same way it handles symbolic expressions.

Here's the proposed fix:

```python
### sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def _trigsimp(expr, deep=False):
    # protect the cache from non-trig patterns; we only allow
    # trig patterns to enter the cache
    if expr.has(*_trigs):
        return __trigsimp(expr, deep)
    return expr
=======
def _trigsimp(expr, deep=False):
    # protect the cache from non-trig patterns; we only allow
    # trig patterns to enter the cache
    if expr.has(*_trigs):
        # Convert rational numbers in trig arguments to symbols temporarily
        from sympy import Symbol, solve
        subs_dict = {}
        for func in expr.atoms(*_trigs):
            if func.args[0].is_Rational:
                sym = Symbol('_temp_%s' % len(subs_dict))
                subs_dict[sym] = func.args[0]
                expr = expr.subs(func.args[0], sym)
        
        # Perform simplification
        result = __trigsimp(expr, deep)
        
        # Substitute back the rational numbers
        for sym, val in subs_dict.items():
            result = result.subs(sym, val)
        return result
    return expr
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:

1. Temporarily converts rational numbers in trigonometric arguments to symbols
2. Performs the normal trigonometric simplification
3. Substitutes the original rational numbers back

This allows the simplification rules to work on the symbolic form first, which has better support for trigonometric identities, and then restores the rational numbers afterward. This should enable simplifications like `cos(x-y)` to work even when x and y are rational numbers.

The fix preserves the existing behavior for purely symbolic expressions while adding support for rational number arguments. It should resolve the issue shown in the example where `sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + cos(1/50)*cos(1/25)` wasn't being simplified to `cos(1/50 - 1/25)`.
