Based on the issue description and the code, the bug appears to be in the `coth` class's `eval` method where there's a typo in the variable name. The error occurs when trying to access `cotm` which is undefined - it should be `cothm` instead.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:
=======
                    if cothm is S.ComplexInfinity:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The bug occurs in the `eval` method where it's checking if the cotangent value is complex infinity. The variable `cothm` was correctly defined a few lines above with `cothm = coth(m)`, but then incorrectly referenced as `cotm` in the conditional check.

This fix ensures we're using the correct variable name `cothm` that was previously defined, which should resolve the NameError that was occurring when evaluating coth(log(tan(x))) for certain integral values.
