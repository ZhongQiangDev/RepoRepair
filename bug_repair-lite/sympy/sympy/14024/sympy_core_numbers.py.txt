Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in how Integer/Rational numbers handle exponentiation with negative exponents. The issue shows that `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` gives inconsistent results when `a` is a Symbol vs when it's a concrete number.

The key problem is in the `_eval_power` method of the Integer class. When handling negative exponents, it's not properly handling the sign of the base. Let's fix this in the Integer class:

```python
### sympy/core/numbers.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if expt.is_negative:
            # invert base and change sign on exponent
            ne = -expt
            if self.is_negative:
                if expt.q != 1:
                    return -(S.NegativeOne)**((expt.p % expt.q) /
                            S(expt.q))*Rational(1, -self)**ne
                else:
                    return (S.NegativeOne)**ne*Rational(1, -self)**ne
            else:
                return Rational(1, self.p)**ne

        if expt.is_negative:
            # invert base and change sign on exponent
            ne = -expt
            if self.is_negative:
                if expt.q != 1:
                    return -(S.NegativeOne)**((expt.p % expt.q) /
                            S(expt.q))*Rational(1, -self)**ne
                else:
                    return S.NegativeOne**expt*Rational(1, -self)**ne
            else:
                return Rational(1, self.p)**ne
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix changes how we handle the sign factor when raising a negative number to a negative exponent. Instead of `(S.NegativeOne)**ne`, we use `S.NegativeOne**expt` to maintain consistency with the symbolic case.

This change ensures that `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` evaluates consistently whether `a` is a Symbol or a concrete number. The sign handling is now aligned with how SymPy handles symbolic expressions.

The key difference is that in the original code, the negative sign was being handled with the inverted exponent (`ne`), while in the fixed version we use the original exponent (`expt`), which preserves the correct sign behavior.
