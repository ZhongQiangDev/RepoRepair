Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `_entry` method of the `BlockMatrix` class. The current implementation incorrectly handles block matrix element access by not properly tracking which block we're in when accessing elements.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _entry(self, i, j, **kwargs):
        # Find row entry
        for row_block, numrows in enumerate(self.rowblocksizes):
            if (i < numrows) != False:
                break
            else:
                i -= numrows
        for col_block, numcols in enumerate(self.colblocksizes):
            if (j < numcols) != False:
                break
            else:
                j -= numcols
        return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][i, j]
=======
    def _entry(self, i, j, **kwargs):
        # Find row entry
        row_block = 0
        row_offset = i
        for numrows in self.rowblocksizes:
            if row_offset < numrows:
                break
            row_offset -= numrows
            row_block += 1
        
        # Find column entry    
        col_block = 0
        col_offset = j
        for numcols in self.colblocksizes:
            if col_offset < numcols:
                break
            col_offset -= numcols
            col_block += 1
            
        if row_block >= self.blockshape[0] or col_block >= self.blockshape[1]:
            raise IndexError("Block index out of range")
            
        return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][row_offset, col_offset]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix makes several important changes:

1. Properly tracks both the block index and the offset within that block separately
2. Uses clearer variable names (row_offset/col_offset instead of reusing i/j)
3. Adds bounds checking to prevent accessing invalid blocks
4. Maintains proper offsets when accessing the inner block matrix

The original code had issues with the logic for determining which block to access and didn't properly maintain the relative position within each block. The new implementation correctly tracks both the block position and the relative position within each block, which fixes the issue described where C[i,0] was incorrectly simplified to A[i,0].

This fix will ensure that when accessing elements of a BlockMatrix, it properly determines which block contains the element and correctly calculates the relative position within that block.
