Based on the issue description, the bug is in the pretty printing of `Product` expressions, where there are two main issues:
1. There is an empty line at the bottom of the ∏ symbol that makes it look asymmetric
2. The ∏ symbol is too wide

Looking at the code, this is handled in the `_print_Product` method. Let's fix these issues by:

1. Removing the extra empty line by adjusting the sign lines
2. Making the ∏ symbol thinner by reducing the width calculation

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            width = (func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 2
            sign_lines = []
            sign_lines.append(corner_chr + (horizontal_chr*width) + corner_chr)
            for i in range(func_height + 1):
                sign_lines.append(vertical_chr + (' '*width) + vertical_chr)

            pretty_sign = stringPict('')
            pretty_sign = prettyForm(*pretty_sign.stack(*sign_lines))
=======
            width = (func_height + 1) * 3 // 2  # Reduced width ratio
            sign_lines = []
            sign_lines.append(corner_chr + (horizontal_chr*width) + corner_chr)
            for i in range(func_height):  # Removed +1 to eliminate extra line
                sign_lines.append(vertical_chr + (' '*width) + vertical_chr)

            pretty_sign = stringPict('')
            pretty_sign = prettyForm(*pretty_sign.stack(*sign_lines))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Reduces the width calculation from `(func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 2` to `(func_height + 1) * 3 // 2` to make the ∏ symbol thinner
2. Changes `range(func_height + 1)` to `range(func_height)` to remove the extra empty line at the bottom

The result will be a more compact and symmetric product symbol that better matches the style of other mathematical notations.
