Based on the issue description, the problem is that in the pretty printing of a Sum expression with an additional term, the additional term is not properly aligned with the summation variable. Looking at the code, this is handled in the `_print_Sum` method of the `PrettyPrinter` class.

The issue appears to be that the baseline of the pretty form is not being set correctly. The baseline should be adjusted to align the summation variable with any additional terms. Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2
=======
        prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2 + 1
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adjusts the baseline by adding 1 to properly align the summation variable with additional terms.

The fix increases the baseline position by 1 unit, which will move the summation variable up slightly to align with any additional terms that appear after the sum. This addresses the alignment issue shown in the example where `x` and `+ 3` were not properly aligned.

The change is minimal but effective - it maintains all the existing pretty printing logic while just tweaking the vertical positioning to achieve proper alignment.
