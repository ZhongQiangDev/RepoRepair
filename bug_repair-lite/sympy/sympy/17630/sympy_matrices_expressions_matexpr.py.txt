Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when multiplying a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks multiple times. The error shows that after the first multiplication, the ZeroMatrix blocks are converted to Zero objects which don't have the required 'cols' attribute.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the ZeroMatrix class implementation. The ZeroMatrix class needs to maintain its type through operations rather than being converted to a simple Zero scalar.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _entry(self, i, j, **kwargs):
        return S.Zero

    def __nonzero__(self):
        return False

    __bool__ = __nonzero__
=======
    def _entry(self, i, j, **kwargs):
        return S.Zero

    def __nonzero__(self):
        return False

    __bool__ = __nonzero__

    def _eval_power(self, exp):
        if exp.is_zero:
            from .identity import Identity
            return Identity(self.rows)
        return self

    def _eval_mul(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, MatrixExpr):
            if self.cols != other.rows:
                raise ShapeError("Matrices %s, %s are not aligned" % (self, other))
            return ZeroMatrix(self.rows, other.cols)
        return self * other

    def _eval_rmul(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, MatrixExpr):
            if other.cols != self.rows:
                raise ShapeError("Matrices %s, %s are not aligned" % (other, self))
            return ZeroMatrix(other.rows, self.cols)
        return other * self
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds proper matrix multiplication handling for ZeroMatrix by:

1. Adding `_eval_mul` to handle left multiplication, ensuring the result stays as a ZeroMatrix with proper dimensions
2. Adding `_eval_rmul` to handle right multiplication, ensuring the result stays as a ZeroMatrix with proper dimensions 
3. Adding `_eval_power` to handle matrix powers properly

The key is that these methods ensure that operations with ZeroMatrix maintain the ZeroMatrix type rather than degrading to a scalar Zero. This preserves the matrix dimensions and required matrix attributes like 'cols' and 'rows'.

This should fix the issue where multiple multiplications of a BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks fails. The ZeroMatrix blocks will now maintain their matrix nature through the multiplication operations.
