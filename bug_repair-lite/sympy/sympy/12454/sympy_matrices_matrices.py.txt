From the issue description, the bug occurs in the `is_upper()` method when checking if a matrix is upper triangular. The problem is that the method tries to access indices beyond the matrix dimensions for tall matrices (more rows than columns).

The issue occurs because the code iterates over `range(i)` for each row `i`, but for tall matrices this can exceed the number of columns. For example, with a 4x2 matrix, when i=3 it tries to access column index 2 which is out of bounds.

The fix is to limit the inner loop to only iterate up to the minimum of i and the number of columns. Here's the edit:

```python
### sympy/matrices/matrices.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return all(self[i, j].is_zero
                   for i in range(1, self.rows)
                   for j in range(i))
=======
        return all(self[i, j].is_zero
                   for i in range(1, self.rows)
                   for j in range(min(i, self.cols)))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that we never try to access column indices beyond the matrix dimensions. For a 4x2 matrix:

- When i=1: j ranges from 0 to min(1,2)=1 
- When i=2: j ranges from 0 to min(2,2)=2
- When i=3: j ranges from 0 to min(3,2)=2

So it will properly check all elements below the diagonal without trying to access invalid indices.

The fix maintains the original behavior for square matrices while properly handling tall matrices by limiting the column indices to valid values.
