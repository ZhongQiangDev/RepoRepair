Based on the issue statement, the bug occurs in the `_TR56` helper function used by `TR6` when trying to compare a complex number `I` with 0 using `<`. The error occurs specifically in this line:

```python
if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
```

When `rv.exp` is the complex number `I`, this comparison is invalid and raises the TypeError.

Here's the fix that checks for complex numbers before attempting the comparison:

```python
### sympy/simplify/fu.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
            return rv
        if (rv.exp > max) == True:
            return rv
=======
        # Skip complex exponents
        if rv.exp.is_complex:
            return rv
        # Compare real exponents 
        if rv.exp.is_real:
            if (rv.exp < 0) == True:
                return rv
            if (rv.exp > max) == True:
                return rv
=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:

1. Adds a check for complex exponents using `is_complex` and skips the transformation if the exponent is complex
2. Only performs the comparison operations when we know the exponent is real using `is_real`
3. Maintains the same behavior for real exponents while preventing invalid complex number comparisons

This will prevent the TypeError when trying to compare complex numbers like `I` while preserving the original functionality for real exponents.

The fix handles the original issue case `cos(x)**I` by detecting that `I` is complex and returning the expression unchanged rather than attempting invalid comparisons.
