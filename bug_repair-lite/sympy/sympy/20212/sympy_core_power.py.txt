Based on the issue statement, the bug is in the `Pow` class's evaluation of `0**-oo`. According to the documentation, it should return `zoo` (ComplexInfinity) but currently returns 0.

Looking at the code, this case should be handled in the `__new__` method of the `Pow` class. The issue is that there isn't a specific case handling `0**-oo`. Let's add this case:

```python
### sympy/core/power.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if e is S.ComplexInfinity:
                return S.NaN
            if e is S.Zero:
                return S.One
            elif e is S.One:
                return b
            elif e == -1 and not b:
                return S.ComplexInfinity
=======
            if e is S.ComplexInfinity:
                return S.NaN
            if e is S.Zero:
                return S.One
            elif e is S.One:
                return b
            elif e == -1 and not b:
                return S.ComplexInfinity
            elif b.is_zero:
                if e.is_negative and e.is_infinite:
                    return S.ComplexInfinity
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds a specific case to handle when the base is 0 and the exponent is negative infinity. In this case, it returns ComplexInfinity (zoo) as specified in the documentation.

The fix works by:
1. Checking if the base is zero using `b.is_zero`
2. Checking if the exponent is both negative and infinite using `e.is_negative and e.is_infinite`
3. Returning `S.ComplexInfinity` in this case, which is SymPy's representation of zoo

This matches the documentation which states that `0**-oo` should return `zoo` even though it's technically an indeterminate form, as it's convenient when the base is positive.
