Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when trying to convert a BlockDiagMatrix with a single matrix element back to a regular Matrix. The error occurs in the `_entry` method of BlockMatrix class when trying to access elements of a single matrix block.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the BlockDiagMatrix class where it doesn't properly handle the case of a single matrix. The `_entry` method inherited from BlockMatrix assumes a block structure, but for a single matrix we should just return the element directly.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _entry(self, i, j, **kwargs):
        # Find row entry
        for row_block, numrows in enumerate(self.rowblocksizes):
            if (i < numrows) != False:
                break
            else:
                i -= numrows
        for col_block, numcols in enumerate(self.colblocksizes):
            if (j < numcols) != False:
                break
            else:
                j -= numcols
        return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][i, j]
=======
    def _entry(self, i, j, **kwargs):
        # Special case for single matrix
        if len(self.args) == 1:
            return self.args[0][i, j]
            
        # Find row entry
        for row_block, numrows in enumerate(self.rowblocksizes):
            if (i < numrows) != False:
                break
            else:
                i -= numrows
        for col_block, numcols in enumerate(self.colblocksizes):
            if (j < numcols) != False:
                break
            else:
                j -= numcols
        return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][i, j]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a special case for when BlockDiagMatrix contains only one matrix. In that case, we directly access the elements from that single matrix instead of trying to handle it as a block structure. This should resolve the "TypeError: 'One' object is not subscriptable" error when converting a single-matrix BlockDiagMatrix to a regular Matrix.

The fix works because:
1. It checks if there's only one matrix in the BlockDiagMatrix using `len(self.args) == 1`
2. If true, it directly returns the element from that matrix using `self.args[0][i, j]`
3. Otherwise, it falls back to the original block matrix element access logic

This maintains the existing functionality for multi-matrix BlockDiagMatrix while fixing the single-matrix case.
