Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `atoms()` method of the `Basic` class. The issue states that `expr.atoms()` should return objects with no args instead of subclasses of `Atom`. Currently, it returns all instances of `Atom` subclasses, but it should only return objects that have no `.args`.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/core/basic.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if types:
            types = tuple(
                [t if isinstance(t, type) else type(t) for t in types])
        else:
            types = (Atom,)
        result = set()
        for expr in preorder_traversal(self):
            if isinstance(expr, types):
                result.add(expr)
        return result

        if types:
            types = tuple(
                [t if isinstance(t, type) else type(t) for t in types])
            result = set()
            for expr in preorder_traversal(self):
                if isinstance(expr, types):
                    result.add(expr)
            return result
        else:
            result = set()
            for expr in preorder_traversal(self):
                if not expr.args:
                    result.add(expr)
            return result
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the `atoms()` method to:

1. Keep the existing behavior when specific types are provided as arguments (e.g., `expr.atoms(Symbol)` will still return all symbols)

2. Change the default behavior (when no types are specified) to return only objects that have no `.args`, rather than all instances of `Atom` subclasses

The fix ensures that `expr.atoms()` returns true leaf nodes (nodes with no arguments) rather than all instances of the `Atom` class. This matches the issue description that states "the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`".

The change is backward compatible for cases where specific types are provided, but changes the default behavior to be more logically consistent with what constitutes a leaf node in the expression tree.
