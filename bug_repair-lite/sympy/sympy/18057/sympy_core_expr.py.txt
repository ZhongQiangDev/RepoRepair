Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `__eq__` method of the `Expr` class where it attempts to evaluate reprs by passing them through `sympify()`, which can lead to unsafe eval of arbitrary strings.

The fix is to modify the `__eq__` method to avoid evaluating unknown objects' reprs. Here's the edit:

```python
### sympy/core/expr.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __eq__(self, other):
        try:
            other = sympify(other)
            if not isinstance(other, Expr):
                return False
        except (SympifyError, SyntaxError):
            return False
        # check for pure number expr
        if  not (self.is_Number and other.is_Number) and (
                type(self) != type(other)):
            return False
        a, b = self._hashable_content(), other._hashable_content()
        if a != b:
            return False
        # check number *in* an expression
        for a, b in zip(a, b):
            if not isinstance(a, Expr):
                continue
            if a.is_Number and type(a) != type(b):
                return False
        return True
=======
    def __eq__(self, other):
        # Don't attempt to sympify unknown objects since their repr 
        # could be malicious
        if not isinstance(other, Basic):
            return False
        if not isinstance(other, Expr):
            return False
        # check for pure number expr
        if not (self.is_Number and other.is_Number) and (
                type(self) != type(other)):
            return False
        a, b = self._hashable_content(), other._hashable_content()
        if a != b:
            return False
        # check number *in* an expression
        for a, b in zip(a, b):
            if not isinstance(a, Expr):
                continue
            if a.is_Number and type(a) != type(b):
                return False
        return True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:

1. Removes the unsafe `sympify()` call that could evaluate arbitrary strings
2. Adds a type check to only compare against Basic/Expr objects
3. Maintains the same equality comparison logic for valid SymPy expressions

The fix prevents the security issue by avoiding evaluation of unknown objects' string representations while preserving the intended equality comparison behavior for valid SymPy expressions.
