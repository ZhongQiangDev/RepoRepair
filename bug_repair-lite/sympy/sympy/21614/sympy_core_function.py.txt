Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `Derivative` class's `_eval_derivative` method, where it's not properly handling the derivative's `kind` attribute. The issue shows that for a matrix symbol `A`, `Derivative(A, x).kind` incorrectly returns `UndefinedKind` when it should preserve the kind from the expression being differentiated.

Let's fix this by adding proper kind handling in the `_eval_derivative` method:

```python
### sympy/core/function.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _eval_derivative(self, v):
        # If v (the variable of differentiation) is not in
        # self.variables, we might be able to take the derivative.
        if v not in self._wrt_variables:
            dedv = self.expr.diff(v)
            if isinstance(dedv, Derivative):
                return dedv.func(dedv.expr, *(self.variable_count + dedv.variable_count))
            # dedv (d(self.expr)/dv) could have simplified things such that the
            # derivative wrt things in self.variables can now be done. Thus,
            # we set evaluate=True to see if there are any other derivatives
            # that can be done. The most common case is when dedv is a simple
            # number so that the derivative wrt anything else will vanish.
            return self.func(dedv, *self.variables, evaluate=True)
        # In this case v was in self.variables so the derivative wrt v has
        # already been attempted and was not computed, either because it
        # couldn't be or evaluate=False originally.
        variable_count = list(self.variable_count)
        variable_count.append((v, 1))
        return self.func(self.expr, *variable_count, evaluate=False)

            dedv = self.expr.diff(v)
            if isinstance(dedv, Derivative):
                result = dedv.func(dedv.expr, *(self.variable_count + dedv.variable_count))
                if hasattr(self.expr, 'kind'):

            result = self.func(dedv, *self.variables, evaluate=True)
            if hasattr(self.expr, 'kind'):
                result = result.copy_kind_from(self.expr)
            return result
        # In this case v was in self.variables so the derivative wrt v has
        # already been attempted and was not computed, either because it

        variable_count = list(self.variable_count)
        variable_count.append((v, 1))
        result = self.func(self.expr, *variable_count, evaluate=False)
        if hasattr(self.expr, 'kind'):
            result = result.copy_kind_from(self.expr)
        return result

```

This fix adds proper handling of the `kind` attribute by:

1. Checking if the expression being differentiated has a `kind` attribute
2. If it does, copying that kind to the resulting derivative using `copy_kind_from`
3. Doing this for all three return paths in the method

This ensures that matrix derivatives preserve their matrix kind information, fixing the issue where `Derivative(A, x).kind` was returning `UndefinedKind` instead of the proper `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`.

The fix assumes the existence of a `copy_kind_from` method on expressions that have kinds. If this method doesn't exist, we would need to add that as well, but based on the context it seems this functionality should already be available since the `Integral` case works correctly.
