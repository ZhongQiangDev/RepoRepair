Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `partitions()` function where it reuses the same dictionary object for each partition instead of creating a new copy. This can lead to incorrect results when trying to store or process multiple partitions at once.

The fix is to yield a copy of the dictionary instead of the original. We need to modify the two `yield` statements in the function that return the partition dictionary. Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/utilities/iterables.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if size:
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms
    else:
        yield ms
=======
    if size:
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
    else:
        yield ms.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And for the second yield statement later in the function:

```python
### sympy/utilities/iterables.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if size:
            yield sum(ms.values()), ms
        else:
            yield ms
=======
        if size:
            yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
        else:
            yield ms.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that each yielded partition is an independent copy of the dictionary, preventing the issue where modifications to one partition affect others. This fixes the problem mentioned in the issue where `list(partitions())` would give incorrect results due to dictionary reuse.

The performance impact of making these copies should be minimal compared to the benefit of having correct behavior, as dictionary copying in Python is relatively efficient for small dictionaries (which these partition dictionaries typically are).
