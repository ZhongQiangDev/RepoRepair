Based on the issue description, the bug is in the inverse trigonometric function handling in the LaTeX printer. The issue states that `acsc` and `asec` are not properly handled when using `inv_trig_style="full"` because they are not included in the `inv_trig_table` list.

The fix is to add `"acsc"` and `"asec"` to the `inv_trig_table` list in the `_print_Function` method. Here's the edit:

```python
### sympy/printing/latex.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acot"]
=======
            inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acsc", "asec", "acot"]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will make the LaTeX printer handle `acsc` and `asec` functions the same way as other inverse trigonometric functions, converting them to `arccsc` and `arcsec` respectively when `inv_trig_style="full"` is used.

The fix matches what was suggested in the issue description and will allow the LaTeX printer to properly format all inverse trigonometric functions consistently.
