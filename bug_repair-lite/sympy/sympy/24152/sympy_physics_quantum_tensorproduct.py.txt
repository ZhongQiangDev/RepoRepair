Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method of the `TensorProduct` class. The issue occurs when expanding tensor products with scalar factors, where the expansion stops incomplete because it doesn't properly handle cases where the TensorProduct constructor returns a Mul of commutative factors and a TensorProduct.

Here's the fix using the SEARCH/REPLACE format:

```python
### sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                for aa in args[i].args:
                    tp = TensorProduct(*args[:i] + (aa,) + args[i + 1:])
                    add_args.append(tp)
                break
=======
                for aa in args[i].args:
                    tp = TensorProduct(*args[:i] + (aa,) + args[i + 1:])
                    c_part, nc_part = tp.args_cnc()
                    if len(nc_part)==1 and isinstance(nc_part[0], TensorProduct):
                        nc_part = (nc_part[0]._eval_expand_tensorproduct(), )
                    add_args.append(Mul(*c_part)*Mul(*nc_part))
                break
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:

1. Splits the tensor product into commutative and non-commutative parts using `args_cnc()`
2. Checks if there's exactly one non-commutative part and if it's a TensorProduct
3. If so, recursively expands that TensorProduct
4. Combines the commutative and non-commutative parts back together with proper multiplication

This ensures that scalar factors are properly handled during expansion and prevents the incomplete expansion issue described in the bug report.

The fix matches the proposed solution in the issue, addressing the case where TensorProduct constructor returns a Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..)) by properly handling the commutative and non-commutative parts separately.
