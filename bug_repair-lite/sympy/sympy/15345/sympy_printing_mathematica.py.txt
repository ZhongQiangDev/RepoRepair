Based on the issue description, the bug is that the `mathematica_code()` function outputs `Max(2, x)` instead of the expected Mathematica syntax `Max[x,2]` when given `Max(x,2)` as input.

Looking at the code, the issue is that there's no specific handling for the `Max` function in the `known_functions` dictionary. Additionally, the default function printing in `_print_Function` uses parentheses instead of square brackets for unknown functions.

Here's the fix - we need to add `Max` to the `known_functions` dictionary:

```python
### sympy/printing/mathematica.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    "conjugate": [(lambda x: True, "Conjugate")],

}
=======
    "conjugate": [(lambda x: True, "Conjugate")],
    "Max": [(lambda x: True, "Max")],
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds `Max` to the list of known functions. When the printer encounters `Max(x,2)`, it will now use the proper Mathematica syntax with square brackets: `Max[x,2]`.

The fix works because:
1. The `_print_Function` method checks if the function name is in `known_functions`
2. When it finds `Max` in the dictionary, it uses the format `"%s[%s]"` with square brackets
3. The arguments are properly stringified and joined with commas

This will ensure that `mathematica_code(Max(x,2))` outputs `'Max[x,2]'` as expected.
