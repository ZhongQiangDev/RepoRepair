Based on the issue description, the bug is in the Intersection class implementation where it's not properly handling duplicates in the input arguments. The issue shows that `Intersection({1},{1},{x})` incorrectly returns `EmptySet()` when it should return `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated.

The fix needs to be in the `__new__` method of the Intersection class to remove duplicates at instantiation. Here's the edit:

```python
### sympy/sets/sets.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        evaluate = kwargs.get('evaluate', global_evaluate[0])

        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)

        # Reduce sets using known rules
        if evaluate:
            args = list(cls._new_args_filter(args))
            return simplify_intersection(args)

        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))

        obj = Basic.__new__(cls, *args)
        obj._argset = frozenset(args)
        return obj
=======
    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        evaluate = kwargs.get('evaluate', global_evaluate[0])

        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)

        # Remove duplicates while preserving order
        args = list(dict.fromkeys(args))

        # Reduce sets using known rules
        if evaluate:
            args = list(cls._new_args_filter(args))
            return simplify_intersection(args)

        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))

        obj = Basic.__new__(cls, *args)
        obj._argset = frozenset(args)
        return obj
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:

1. Adds `args = list(dict.fromkeys(args))` to remove duplicates while preserving order before evaluation
2. Keeps the original ordering and evaluation logic intact
3. Ensures that duplicate sets are removed at instantiation time

This will prevent the incorrect evaluation of `Intersection({1},{1},{x})` to `EmptySet()` since the duplicate `{1}` will be removed before evaluation, leaving only `Intersection({1},{x})` to be evaluated properly.

The use of `dict.fromkeys()` is a clean and efficient way to remove duplicates while preserving order in Python 3.7+. This approach is better than using a set since sets don't preserve order and we want to maintain the original ordering as much as possible before the final ordering is applied.
