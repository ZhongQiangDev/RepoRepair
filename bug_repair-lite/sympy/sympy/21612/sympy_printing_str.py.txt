Based on the issue description, the bug is in the parsing of fractions in LaTeX expressions, where the denominator is missing proper parentheses. The issue is not directly in the StrPrinter code shown, but rather in how fractions are handled in the LaTeX parsing.

The issue states that `"\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"` is incorrectly parsed to `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)` when it should be `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`.

Looking at the code provided, this appears to be a parsing issue rather than a printing issue. The StrPrinter code shown is responsible for converting SymPy expressions to strings, but not for parsing LaTeX expressions.

The actual bug would likely be in the LaTeX parsing code (sympy/parsing/latex.py), which is not shown in the provided code. Without seeing that code, I cannot generate the specific search/replace edits needed.

To properly fix this issue, we would need to see the LaTeX parsing code that handles fraction expressions. The fix would likely involve ensuring proper parenthesization of denominators when parsing nested fractions.

Could you please provide the relevant code from sympy/parsing/latex.py, particularly the parts that handle fraction parsing? This would allow me to generate the specific search/replace edits needed to fix the issue.
