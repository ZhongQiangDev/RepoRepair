Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in the Identity matrix class where summing all elements returns 0 instead of n (the size of the matrix). The issue occurs because the Identity matrix's elements are not being properly handled when summed.

The fix needs to be in the `Identity` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`. We need to add a method to properly handle the sum of all elements. The sum of an Identity matrix should be equal to its size (n) since it has 1's on the diagonal and 0's elsewhere.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _eval_determinant(self):
        return S.One







=======
    def _eval_determinant(self):
        return S.One

    def _eval_sum(self):
        return self.rows







>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a `_eval_sum()` method to the Identity class that returns the number of rows (which is equal to n for an Identity matrix), properly handling the sum of all elements. This works because an Identity matrix has exactly n ones (one in each diagonal position) and all other elements are zero, so the sum of all elements equals n.

The fix ensures that when SymPy evaluates the sum of all elements in an Identity matrix, it correctly returns n instead of 0. This matches the mathematical property that the sum of all elements in an n√ón identity matrix equals n.
