From the issue description, the bug is that when lambdifying a tuple with one element, the generated code is missing the comma after the element, causing it to be interpreted as just parentheses around a value rather than a tuple.

Looking at the code, this is happening in the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class which is responsible for generating the Python code. However, this class is not shown in the provided file. The issue is likely in the printer implementation.

Since we don't have access to the printer code, we can work around this in the `lambdify` function by explicitly handling single-element tuples before passing them to the printer.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sympy/utilities/lambdify.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if cse == True:
        from sympy.simplify.cse_main import cse as _cse
        cses, _expr = _cse(expr, list=False)
    elif callable(cse):
        cses, _expr = cse(expr)
    else:
        cses, _expr = (), expr
=======
    # Handle single-element tuples explicitly
    if isinstance(expr, (list, tuple)) and len(expr) == 1:
        expr = (expr[0],)  # Force trailing comma

    if cse == True:
        from sympy.simplify.cse_main import cse as _cse
        cses, _expr = _cse(expr, list=False)
    elif callable(cse):
        cses, _expr = cse(expr)
    else:
        cses, _expr = (), expr
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix explicitly converts single-element sequences to tuples with a trailing comma before they get processed by the printer. This ensures that when the printer generates code for the tuple, it will maintain the proper tuple syntax with the comma.

The fix works by:
1. Checking if the expression is a list/tuple with exactly one element
2. If so, creating a new tuple with a trailing comma using Python's tuple syntax
3. Letting the rest of the processing continue as normal

This should resolve the issue where `lambdify([], tuple([1]))` was generating `return (1)` instead of `return (1,)`.
