Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `_set_lim` method of the `Axis` class. The issue is that when setting axis limits with shared axes, the `xlim_changed` callback is not emitted for the shared axes because `emit=False` is passed when updating them.

The fix is to move the callback processing outside of the `if emit:` block so that callbacks are always triggered regardless of the emit flag. Here's the edit:

```python
### lib/matplotlib/axis.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if emit:
            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
            # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
            for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
                if other is not self:
                    other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                                   emit=False, auto=auto)
=======
        # Process callbacks regardless of emit flag
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        if emit:
            # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
            for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
                if other is not self:
                    other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                                   emit=False, auto=auto)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `xlim_changed` callback is always processed when limits are changed, while still preventing infinite recursion by using `emit=False` when propagating changes to shared axes.

The fix moves the callback processing outside the `emit` condition while keeping the shared axis updates inside it. This way:

1. The callback is always triggered when limits change
2. The shared axis updates still use `emit=False` to prevent recursion
3. Each axis will process its own callbacks when its limits are changed

This addresses the issue while maintaining the necessary recursion prevention.
