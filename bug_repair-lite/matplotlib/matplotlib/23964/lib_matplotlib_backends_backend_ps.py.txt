Based on the issue description, the bug occurs when trying to save a figure with a text label containing an empty line using the PostScript backend. The error occurs because `curr_stream` can be None when processing empty lines, causing an unpacking error.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `draw_text` method of the `RendererPS` class in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py`. When processing text with empty lines using TTF fonts, `curr_stream` can be None but is still appended to the stream list.

Here's the fix:

```python
### lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            # append the last entry
            stream.append(curr_stream)
=======
            # append the last entry if it exists
            if curr_stream:
                stream.append(curr_stream)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a check to only append `curr_stream` to the stream list if it is not None. This prevents the TypeError when trying to unpack a None value later when iterating through the stream.

The fix matches the suggestion in the issue that adding "if curr_stream:" would resolve the bug. This handles cases where text contains empty lines, which previously caused the None value to be appended to the stream list.
