Based on the issue description, the bug appears to be in the `option_desc_re` regex pattern in sphinx/domains/std.py. The current regex is too restrictive and doesn't accept valid option syntax like `[enable=]PATTERN`.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sphinx/domains/std.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
# RE for option descriptions
option_desc_re = re.compile(r'((?:/|--|-|\+)?[^\s=[]+)(=?\s*.*)')
=======
# RE for option descriptions
option_desc_re = re.compile(r'(\[?(?:/|--|-|\+)?[^\s=\]]+\]?)(=?\s*.*)')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds `\[?` and `\]?` to optionally allow square brackets around the option name
2. Adjusts the character class to exclude `]` as well as spaces and equals signs
3. Maintains the existing capture groups for the option name and arguments

The modified regex will now accept:
- Standard options like `-opt`, `--opt`, `/opt`, `+opt` 
- Options with square brackets like `[enable=]`
- Options with arguments like `--opt=value` or `-opt value`

This preserves backward compatibility while adding support for the `[enable=]PATTERN` syntax that was previously working in older Sphinx versions.
