Based on the issue description, the problem is that index entries with special characters like @, £, and ← are being split into two separate "Symbols" sections in the index - one before and one after the alphabetical entries. This happens because of how the sorting and grouping logic handles non-alphabetical characters.

The bug is in the `keyfunc3` function where it determines the grouping key for index entries. The current logic puts all non-alphabetical characters under "Symbols", but doesn't ensure they're grouped together consistently.

Here's the fix:

```python
### sphinx/environment/adapters/indexentries.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if v[2] is None:
                # now calculate the key
                if k.startswith('\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):
                    k = k[1:]
                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()
                if letter.isalpha() or letter == '_':
                    return letter
                else:
                    # get all other symbols under one heading
                    return _('Symbols')
            else:
                return v[2]

            if v[2] is None:
                # now calculate the key
                if k.startswith('\N{RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK}'):
                    k = k[1:]
                letter = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', k[0])[0].upper()
                if letter.isalpha():
                    return letter
                else:
                    # get all symbols (including _) under one heading
                    # and ensure they sort before letters
                    return '\0' + _('Symbols')
            else:
                # Ensure custom categories also maintain consistent ordering
                return '\0' + v[2] if not v[2][0:1].isalpha() else v[2]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix makes the following changes:

1. Removes the special handling of underscore (_) to group it with symbols instead of as a letter
2. Adds a '\0' prefix to the 'Symbols' category key to ensure it always sorts before alphabetical entries
3. Applies the same prefix logic to custom category keys that don't start with letters

This ensures that:
- All non-alphabetical characters (including @, £, ←, and _) are grouped into a single Symbols section
- The Symbols section always appears before the alphabetical entries
- There won't be multiple Symbols sections in different places in the index
- Custom categories maintain consistent ordering

The '\0' prefix works because it's the lowest possible character value, ensuring the Symbols section will always sort first.
