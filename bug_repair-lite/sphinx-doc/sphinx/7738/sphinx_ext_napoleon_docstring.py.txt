Based on the issue description, the bug is in the `_escape_args_and_kwargs` method of the `GoogleDocstring` class in `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py`. The issue is that trailing underscores are being escaped with a backslash, which is causing them to appear visibly in the HTML output.

The fix is to remove the special handling of trailing underscores since they don't need escaping. Here's the edit:

```python
### sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _escape_args_and_kwargs(self, name: str) -> str:
        if name.endswith('_'):
            name = name[:-1] + r'\_'

        if name[:2] == '**':
            return r'\*\*' + name[2:]
        elif name[:1] == '*':
            return r'\*' + name[1:]
        else:
            return name
=======
    def _escape_args_and_kwargs(self, name: str) -> str:
        if name[:2] == '**':
            return r'\*\*' + name[2:]
        elif name[:1] == '*':
            return r'\*' + name[1:]
        else:
            return name
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit removes the special handling of trailing underscores while keeping the escaping of `*` and `**` prefixes which are still needed for proper rendering of argument names. The trailing underscore doesn't need escaping since it's not a special character in reStructuredText.
