Based on the issue description, the bug is that the `members` variable in the module template contains imported members even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to False. Looking at the code, this occurs in the `generate_autosummary_content()` function where `ns['members']` is populated with `dir(obj)` without filtering out imported members.

Here's the fix - we need to modify the code to filter out imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is False:

```python
### sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if doc.objtype == 'module':
        ns['members'] = dir(obj)
        ns['functions'], ns['all_functions'] = \
            get_members(obj, {'function'}, imported=imported_members)
        ns['classes'], ns['all_classes'] = \
            get_members(obj, {'class'}, imported=imported_members)
        ns['exceptions'], ns['all_exceptions'] = \
            get_members(obj, {'exception'}, imported=imported_members)
        ns['attributes'], ns['all_attributes'] = \
            get_module_attrs(ns['members'])
=======
    if doc.objtype == 'module':
        all_members = dir(obj)
        if not imported_members:
            # Filter out imported members
            members = []
            for member in all_members:
                try:
                    value = safe_getattr(obj, member)
                    if getattr(value, '__module__', None) == obj.__name__:
                        members.append(member)
                except AttributeError:
                    continue
        else:
            members = all_members
            
        ns['members'] = members
        ns['functions'], ns['all_functions'] = \
            get_members(obj, {'function'}, imported=imported_members)
        ns['classes'], ns['all_classes'] = \
            get_members(obj, {'class'}, imported=imported_members)
        ns['exceptions'], ns['all_exceptions'] = \
            get_members(obj, {'exception'}, imported=imported_members)
        ns['attributes'], ns['all_attributes'] = \
            get_module_attrs(members)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Gets all members using `dir(obj)`
2. When `imported_members` is False, filters the members list to only include members that belong to the module itself by checking their `__module__` attribute
3. When `imported_members` is True, keeps all members as before
4. Updates `ns['members']` with the filtered list
5. Uses the filtered members list for getting attributes

This change will ensure that imported members are not included in the template when `autosummary_imported_members` is False, which matches the expected behavior described in the issue.
