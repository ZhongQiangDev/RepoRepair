The issue is that certain TypeScript keywords like `infer` and `type` are being incorrectly highlighted as keywords when followed by an alphabetic character. This is likely due to the regex pattern used for these keywords not correctly excluding cases where they are followed by an alphabetic character.

To fix this, we need to adjust the regex pattern for these specific keywords to ensure they are only treated as keywords when they are not followed by an alphabetic character.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###components/prism-typescript.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		// keywords that have to be followed by an identifier
		// eslint-disable-next-line regexp/no-dupe-characters-character-class
		/\b(?:asserts|infer|interface|module|namespace|type)(?!\s*[^\s_${}*a-zA-Z\xA0-\uFFFF])/
=======
		// keywords that have to be followed by an identifier
		// eslint-disable-next-line regexp/no-dupe-characters-character-class
		/\b(?:asserts|infer|interface|module|namespace|type)(?!\s*[a-zA-Z\xA0-\uFFFF])/
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the regex pattern to ensure that `infer`, `interface`, `module`, `namespace`, and `type` are only treated as keywords when they are not followed by an alphabetic character. This should resolve the incorrect highlighting issue.
