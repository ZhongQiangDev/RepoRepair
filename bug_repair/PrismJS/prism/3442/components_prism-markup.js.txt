The issue is that the quotes inside the HTML attribute values are being highlighted as punctuation. To fix this, we need to adjust the regex pattern for the `attr-value` inside the `tag` definition so that it doesn't treat the quotes as punctuation.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###components/prism-markup.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
'attr-value': {
	pattern: /=\s*(?:"[^"]*"|'[^']*'|[^\s'">=]+)/,
	inside: {
		'punctuation': [
			{
				pattern: /^=/,
				alias: 'attr-equals'
			},
			/"|'/
		]
	}
},
=======
'attr-value': {
	pattern: /=\s*(?:"[^"]*"|'[^']*'|[^\s'">=]+)/,
	inside: {
		'punctuation': /^=/,
		'attr-equals': /^=/,
		'entity': Prism.languages.markup['entity']
	}
},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the quotes from being treated as punctuation inside the `attr-value` pattern. The quotes will now be treated as part of the attribute value, which should resolve the highlighting issue.
