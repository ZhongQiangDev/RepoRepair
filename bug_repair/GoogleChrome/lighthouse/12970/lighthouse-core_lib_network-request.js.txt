The issue is that local resources (`file:///`) are being highlighted as render-blocking resources, which is incorrect since they are blocked from loading. To fix this, we need to ensure that local resources are not considered as render-blocking resources in the Lighthouse audit.

The relevant code segment is in `network-request.js`, specifically where the `NetworkRequest` class is defined. We need to modify the logic that determines whether a resource is render-blocking.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * @param {NetworkRequest} record
   * @return {boolean}
   */
  static isNonNetworkRequest(record) {
    // The 'protocol' field in devtools a string more like a `scheme`
    return URL.isNonNetworkProtocol(record.protocol);
  }
=======
  /**
   * @param {NetworkRequest} record
   * @return {boolean}
   */
  static isNonNetworkRequest(record) {
    // The 'protocol' field in devtools a string more like a `scheme`
    return URL.isNonNetworkProtocol(record.protocol) || record.url.startsWith('file://');
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that any resource with a `file://` URL is considered a non-network request and thus will not be flagged as a render-blocking resource.
