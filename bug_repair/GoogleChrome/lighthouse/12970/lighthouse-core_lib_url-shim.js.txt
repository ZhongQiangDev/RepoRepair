The issue is that Lighthouse is incorrectly flagging local resources (`file://`) as render-blocking resources. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `file:` protocol is excluded from being considered as a render-blocking resource.

The relevant code segment is in `lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js`, specifically in the `allowedProtocols` array and the `isProtocolAllowed` method. We need to add `file:` to the `allowedProtocols` array and adjust the `isProtocolAllowed` method to handle `file:` protocol appropriately.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const allowedProtocols = [
  'https:', 'http:', 'chrome:', 'chrome-extension:',
];
=======
const allowedProtocols = [
  'https:', 'http:', 'chrome:', 'chrome-extension:', 'file:',
];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Determine if the url has a protocol that we're able to test
   * @param {string} url
   * @return {boolean}
   */
  static isProtocolAllowed(url) {
    try {
      const parsed = new URL(url);
      return allowedProtocols.includes(parsed.protocol);
    } catch (e) {
      return false;
    }
  }
=======
  /**
   * Determine if the url has a protocol that we're able to test
   * @param {string} url
   * @return {boolean}
   */
  static isProtocolAllowed(url) {
    try {
      const parsed = new URL(url);
      if (parsed.protocol === 'file:') {
        return false; // Exclude file protocol from being considered render-blocking
      }
      return allowedProtocols.includes(parsed.protocol);
    } catch (e) {
      return false;
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that local resources (`file://`) are not incorrectly flagged as render-blocking resources by Lighthouse.
