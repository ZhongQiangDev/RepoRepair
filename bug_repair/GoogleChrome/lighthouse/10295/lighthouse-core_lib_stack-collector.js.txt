The error `version.match is not a function` suggests that the `version` property is not a string, but rather a different type (possibly `null` or `undefined`) when the `match` function is called on it. This can happen if the version detection logic in the `detectLibraries` function is not correctly handling cases where the version is not detected.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `version` property is only accessed as a string when it is not `null` or `undefined`. We can add a check to ensure that `version` is a string before calling the `match` function on it.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      if (result) {
        libraries.push({
          id: lib.id,
          name: name,
          version: result.version,
          npm: lib.npm,
        });
      }
=======
      if (result) {
        const version = result.version;
        libraries.push({
          id: lib.id,
          name: name,
          version: typeof version === 'string' ? version : null,
          npm: lib.npm,
        });
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that the `version` property is only set to the detected version if it is a string. If it is not a string (e.g., `null` or `undefined`), it will be set to `null`. This should prevent the `version.match is not a function` error from occurring.
