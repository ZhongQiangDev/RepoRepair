The issue is that the audit is flagging `mailto:` links as failing the `rel="noopener"` check, even though these links should be exempt from this requirement. The audit should ignore `mailto:` links when checking for `rel="noopener"`.

To fix this, we need to modify the audit logic to exclude `mailto:` links from the failing anchors list.

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      .filter(anchor => {
        // Ignore href's that are not real links
        return !anchor.href || !anchor.href.toLowerCase().startsWith('javascript:');
      })
=======
      .filter(anchor => {
        // Ignore href's that are not real links or are mailto links
        return (!anchor.href || 
                anchor.href.toLowerCase().startsWith('javascript:') || 
                anchor.href.toLowerCase().startsWith('mailto:'));
      })
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `mailto:` links are not included in the list of failing anchors, thus preventing the audit from flagging them incorrectly.
