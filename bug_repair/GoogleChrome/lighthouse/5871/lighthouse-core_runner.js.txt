The issue described is that the user agent mentioned in the Lighthouse report's runtime settings does not match the actual user agent used in the test requests. This discrepancy can be confusing, especially when comparing the logs from the web server.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the user agent used in the test requests matches the one reported in the Lighthouse runtime settings. This can be achieved by updating the user agent string in the `Driver` class, which is responsible for setting up the browser environment for the test.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/runner.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const Driver = require('./gather/driver.js');
=======
const Driver = require('./gather/driver.js');

// Update the user agent in the Driver class to match the one used in the test requests
Driver.prototype.setUserAgent = function(userAgent) {
  this.userAgent = userAgent;
};

// Ensure the user agent is set correctly when gathering artifacts from the browser
static async _gatherArtifactsFromBrowser(requestedUrl, runnerOpts, connection) {
  if (!runnerOpts.config.passes) {
    throw new Error('No browser artifacts are either provided or requested.');
  }

  const driver = runnerOpts.driverMock || new Driver(connection);
  const gatherOpts = {
    driver,
    requestedUrl,
    settings: runnerOpts.config.settings,
  };

  // Set the user agent to match the one used in the test requests
  driver.setUserAgent(artifacts.UserAgent);

  const artifacts = await GatherRunner.run(runnerOpts.config.passes, gatherOpts);
  return artifacts;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that the user agent used in the test requests is set correctly in the `Driver` class, which should resolve the discrepancy between the reported user agent and the actual user agent used in the test requests.
