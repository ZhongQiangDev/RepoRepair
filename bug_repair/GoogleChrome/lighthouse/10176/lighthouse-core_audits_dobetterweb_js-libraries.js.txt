The issue described is related to duplicated stack packs and the visibility of experimental entries in the `js-libraries` audit. To address these issues, we need to make changes in the `js-libraries.js` file to handle the duplication and visibility of experimental entries.

### Fix for Duplicated Stack Packs

To fix the duplicated stack packs, we need to ensure that each stack pack has a unique identifier. This can be achieved by adding an `id` property to the stack packs and then filtering out duplicates based on this `id`.

### Fix for Hiding Experimental Entries

To hide the experimental entries from the user, we can add a condition to filter out entries that are marked as experimental before displaying them in the audit results.

Here are the necessary changes:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const libDetails = artifacts.Stacks
  .filter(stack => stack.detector === 'js')
  .map(stack => ({
    name: stack.name,
    version: stack.version,
    npm: stack.npm,
  }));
=======
const libDetails = artifacts.Stacks
  .filter(stack => stack.detector === 'js' && !stack.experimental) // Filter out experimental entries
  .reduce((acc, stack) => {
    if (!acc.find(item => item.id === stack.id)) { // Ensure unique stack packs
      acc.push({
        id: stack.id,
        name: stack.name,
        version: stack.version,
        npm: stack.npm,
      });
    }
    return acc;
  }, []);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Explanation

1. **Filtering Out Experimental Entries**: The `filter` method now includes a condition to exclude entries that have the `experimental` property set to `true`.
2. **Ensuring Unique Stack Packs**: The `reduce` method is used to create an array of unique stack packs based on the `id` property. If a stack pack with the same `id` is already in the array, it is not added again.

These changes should resolve the issues of duplicated stack packs and the visibility of experimental entries in the `js-libraries` audit.
