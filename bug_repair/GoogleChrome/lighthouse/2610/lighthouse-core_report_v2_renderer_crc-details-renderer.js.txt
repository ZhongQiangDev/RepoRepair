The issue described is that the sizes listed under the Critical Request Chain in Lighthouse are incorrect and all listed as the same size, which doesn't match the actual sizes. The problem seems to be in how the `transferSize` is being calculated and displayed for each node in the critical request chain.

The bug is likely in the `createSegment` method where the `transferSize` is being calculated. It appears that the `transferSize` is being accumulated incorrectly, leading to all nodes showing the same size.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `transferSize` for each node is calculated correctly based on its own request's `transferSize` and not accumulated from the parent.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return {
      node,
      isLastChild,
      hasChildren,
      startTime,
      transferSize: transferSize + node.request.transferSize,
      treeMarkers: newTreeMarkers
    };
=======
    return {
      node,
      isLastChild,
      hasChildren,
      startTime,
      transferSize: node.request.transferSize, // Use the node's own transferSize
      treeMarkers: newTreeMarkers
    };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to ensure that the `transferSize` is displayed correctly in the `createChainNode` method:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      const span2 = dom.createElement('span', 'crc-node__chain-duration');
      span2.textContent = Util.formatBytesToKB(details.longestChain.transferSize);
=======
      const span2 = dom.createElement('span', 'crc-node__chain-duration');
      span2.textContent = Util.formatBytesToKB(segment.node.request.transferSize); // Use the segment's transferSize
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should ensure that each node in the critical request chain displays its correct `transferSize`.
