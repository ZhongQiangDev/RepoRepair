The issue described is related to Lighthouse reporting a potential saving of 53 KB for an image that is already 54 KB in size. This suggests that Lighthouse might be calculating the potential savings incorrectly, possibly due to how it determines the natural size of the image or how it calculates the savings based on the displayed size versus the natural size.

To address this, we need to ensure that the natural size of the image is correctly determined and that the potential savings are calculated accurately. The `determineNaturalSize` function is responsible for fetching the natural width and height of the image, and the `afterPass` method calculates the potential savings.

Let's make sure that the `determineNaturalSize` function is correctly fetching the natural size and that the potential savings are calculated based on the correct values.

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/image-elements.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  async fetchElementWithSizeInformation(driver, element) {
    const url = JSON.stringify(element.src);
    try {
      // We don't want this to take forever, 250ms should be enough for images that are cached
      driver.setNextProtocolTimeout(250);
      /** @type {{naturalWidth: number, naturalHeight: number}} */
      const size = await driver.evaluateAsync(`(${determineNaturalSize.toString()})(${url})`);
      return Object.assign(element, size);
    } catch (_) {
      // determineNaturalSize fails on invalid images, which we treat as non-visible
      return element;
    }
  }

      driver.setNextProtocolTimeout(250);
      /** @type {{naturalWidth: number, naturalHeight: number}} */
      const size = await driver.evaluateAsync(`(${determineNaturalSize.toString()})(${url})`);
      // Ensure the natural size is correctly assigned
      return Object.assign(element, {
        naturalWidth: size.naturalWidth,
        naturalHeight: size.naturalHeight,
        resourceSize: Math.min(size.naturalWidth * size.naturalHeight * 3 / 8, element.resourceSize)
      });
    } catch (_) {
      // determineNaturalSize fails on invalid images, which we treat as non-visible
      return element;
    }
  }

      // Calculate potential savings based on the difference between the resource size and the calculated size
      const potentialSavings = Math.max(0, element.resourceSize - (element.naturalWidth * element.naturalHeight * 3 / 8));
      element.potentialSavings = potentialSavings;

```

These changes ensure that the natural size of the image is correctly fetched and that the potential savings are calculated based on the difference between the resource size and the calculated size. This should help address the issue of Lighthouse reporting incorrect potential savings.
