The issue is that the audit is reporting a false positive when the `short_name` is missing from the manifest. The audit should not report a failure if the `short_name` is not present, as it is not a required field.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the audit only checks the length of `short_name` if it is present. If it is not present, the audit should pass.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      const manifestValue = manifest.short_name.value || manifest.name.value || '';
      isShortNameShortEnough = manifestValue && manifestValue.length <= suggestedLength;

      if (!isShortNameShortEnough) {
        debugString = `${suggestedLength} chars is the suggested maximum homescreen label length`;
        debugString += ` (Found: ${manifestValue.length} chars).`;
      }
=======
      const manifestValue = manifest.short_name.value;
      isShortNameShortEnough = !manifestValue || (manifestValue && manifestValue.length <= suggestedLength);

      if (!isShortNameShortEnough && manifestValue) {
        debugString = `${suggestedLength} chars is the suggested maximum homescreen label length`;
        debugString += ` (Found: ${manifestValue.length} chars).`;
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
