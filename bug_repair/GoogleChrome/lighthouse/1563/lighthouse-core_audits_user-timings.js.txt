The issue is that the current implementation of `filterTrace` does not filter out irrelevant user timing marks, such as those injected by Google Ads. To address this, we need to add a filtering mechanism that excludes specific user timing marks based on their names.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    tabTrace.processEvents.filter(evt => {
      if (!evt.cat.includes('blink.user_timing')) {
        return false;
      }

      // reject these "userTiming" events that aren't really UserTiming, by nuking ones with frame data (or requestStart)
      // https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q=trace_event.*?user_timing&sq=package:chromium&type=cs
      return evt.name !== 'requestStart' &&
          evt.name !== 'navigationStart' &&
          evt.name !== 'paintNonDefaultBackgroundColor' &&
          evt.args.frame === undefined;
    })
=======
    tabTrace.processEvents.filter(evt => {
      if (!evt.cat.includes('blink.user_timing')) {
        return false;
      }

      // reject these "userTiming" events that aren't really UserTiming, by nuking ones with frame data (or requestStart)
      // https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q=trace_event.*?user_timing&sq=package:chromium&type=cs
      if (evt.name === 'requestStart' ||
          evt.name === 'navigationStart' ||
          evt.name === 'paintNonDefaultBackgroundColor' ||
          evt.args.frame !== undefined) {
        return false;
      }

      // Exclude irrelevant user timing marks, such as those injected by Google Ads
      if (evt.name.startsWith('goog_') || evt.name.startsWith('ad_')) {
        return false;
      }

      return true;
    })
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new condition to the filter function that excludes user timing marks starting with 'goog_' or 'ad_', which are likely to be injected by Google Ads. This should help in filtering out irrelevant user timing marks and provide a more accurate performance analysis.
