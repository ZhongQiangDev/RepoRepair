The issue described is related to the `String.replace` method and how it handles special characters like `$` in the replacement string. The problem arises when the replacement string contains `$` characters, which have special meaning in the context of `String.replace`. To fix this, we need to ensure that any `$` characters in the replacement string are properly escaped.

However, the provided code snippet does not show the actual usage of `String.replace` that might be causing the issue. Based on the issue description, it seems that the `String.replace` method is used somewhere in the codebase to inject JavaScript content into a page, and this injection is breaking due to unescaped `$` characters.

Since the provided code snippet does not show the problematic `String.replace` usage, I will assume that the issue might be in a different part of the codebase. Nonetheless, I will provide a general solution for escaping `$` characters in a replacement string used with `String.replace`.

Here is a hypothetical fix assuming the `String.replace` usage is somewhere in the codebase:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-renderer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const replacementString = 'console.log("$");';
=======
const replacementString = 'console.log("$");'.replace(/\$/g, '$$');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that any `$` characters in the replacement string are properly escaped by replacing each `$` with `$$`, which is the correct way to escape `$` in the context of `String.replace`.

If the actual problematic code is not in the provided snippet, you should search for any usage of `String.replace` in your codebase where the replacement string is dynamically generated and might contain `$` characters. Then apply the same fix as shown above.
