The issue described is that the audit is erroneously reporting that compression is missing even though gzip compression is enabled. The audit is likely not correctly identifying that the resource is already compressed.

The problem seems to be in the `audit_` method where it checks for uncompressed responses. The `uncompressedResponses` array should only contain resources that are not compressed, but it appears to be including resources that are already compressed.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the audit correctly identifies resources that are already compressed and excludes them from the `uncompressedResponses` array.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const uncompressedResponses = artifacts.ResponseCompression;

    const results = [];
    uncompressedResponses.forEach(record => {
      const originalSize = record.resourceSize;
      const gzipSize = record.gzipSize;
      const gzipSavings = originalSize - gzipSize;

      // we require at least 10% savings off the original size AND at least 1400 bytes
      // if the savings is smaller than either, we don't care
      if (1 - gzipSize / originalSize < IGNORE_THRESHOLD_IN_PERCENT ||
          gzipSavings < IGNORE_THRESHOLD_IN_BYTES
      ) {
        return;
      }
=======
    const uncompressedResponses = artifacts.ResponseCompression.filter(record => {
      // Check if the resource is already compressed by comparing originalSize and gzipSize
      return record.resourceSize !== record.gzipSize;
    });

    const results = [];
    uncompressedResponses.forEach(record => {
      const originalSize = record.resourceSize;
      const gzipSize = record.gzipSize;
      const gzipSavings = originalSize - gzipSize;

      // we require at least 10% savings off the original size AND at least 1400 bytes
      // if the savings is smaller than either, we don't care
      if (1 - gzipSize / originalSize < IGNORE_THRESHOLD_IN_PERCENT ||
          gzipSavings < IGNORE_THRESHOLD_IN_BYTES
      ) {
        return;
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `uncompressedResponses` array only includes resources that are not already compressed, thus preventing the audit from erroneously reporting that compression is missing.
