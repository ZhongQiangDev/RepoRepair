The issue seems to be related to the JavaScript code being improperly sanitized or formatted when it's inlined into the HTML report. The error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token" suggests that there might be an issue with the JavaScript code being inserted into the HTML. The second error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'generatedTime' of undefined" suggests that the report JSON might not be properly formatted or might be missing some required properties.

To address these issues, we need to ensure that the JavaScript code is properly sanitized and that the report JSON is correctly formatted. Here are the steps to fix the issue:

1. Ensure that the JavaScript code is properly sanitized when it's inlined into the HTML.
2. Ensure that the report JSON is correctly formatted and contains all required properties.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const sanitizedJavascript = REPORT_JAVASCRIPT.replace(/<\//g, '\\u003c/');
=======
const sanitizedJavascript = REPORT_JAVASCRIPT.replace(/</g, '\\u003c').replace(/>/g, '\\u003e');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that both `<` and `>` characters are properly escaped in the JavaScript code, which should prevent the "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token" error.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the report JSON is correctly formatted. Here is another *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const sanitizedJson = JSON.stringify(reportAsJson).replace(/</g, '\\u003c');
=======
const sanitizedJson = JSON.stringify(reportAsJson, null, 2).replace(/</g, '\\u003c').replace(/>/g, '\\u003e');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that the report JSON is properly formatted and that both `<` and `>` characters are properly escaped, which should prevent the "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'generatedTime' of undefined" error.
