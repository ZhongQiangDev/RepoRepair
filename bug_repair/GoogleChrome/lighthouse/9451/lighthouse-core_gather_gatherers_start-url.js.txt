The issue described is that Lighthouse reports the start URL does not load offline, but the desktop version of the page is loaded instead. This suggests that the `_attemptStartURLFetch` method is not correctly identifying whether the start URL is being served from the service worker when offline.

To address this, we need to ensure that the `_attemptStartURLFetch` method correctly checks if the start URL is being served from the service worker and handles the case where the page is loaded from the disk cache or not served by the service worker at all.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Try to `fetch(start_url)`, return true if fetched by SW
   * Resolves when we have a matched network request
   * @param {Driver} driver
   * @param {string} startUrl
   * @return {Promise<{statusCode: number, explanation: string}>}
   */
  _attemptStartURLFetch(driver, startUrl) {
    // TODO(phulce): clean up this setTimeout once the response has happened
    // Wait up to 3s to get a matched network request from the fetch() to work
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise(resolve =>
      setTimeout(
        () => resolve({statusCode: -1, explanation: 'Timed out waiting for fetched start_url.'}),
        3000
      )
    );

    const fetchPromise = new Promise(resolve => {
      driver.on('Network.responseReceived', onResponseReceived);

      /** @param {LH.Crdp.Network.ResponseReceivedEvent} responseEvent */
      function onResponseReceived(responseEvent) {
        const {response} = responseEvent;
        // ignore mismatched URLs
        if (response.url !== startUrl) return;
        driver.off('Network.responseReceived', onResponseReceived);

        if (!response.fromServiceWorker && !response.fromDiskCache) {
          return resolve({
            statusCode: -1,
            explanation: 'Unable to fetch start URL via service worker or disk cache.',
          });
        }
        // Successful SW-served or disk cache fetch of the start_URL
        return resolve({statusCode: response.status});
      }
    });

    return driver
      .evaluateAsync(`window.location = '${startUrl}'`)
      .then(() => Promise.race([fetchPromise, timeoutPromise]));
  }

    return driver
      .evaluateAsync(`window.location = '${startUrl}'`)
      .then(() => Promise.race([fetchPromise, timeoutPromise]));
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `_attemptStartURLFetch` method checks both `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` flags to determine if the start URL is being served offline correctly. If neither flag is true, it will report that the start URL cannot be fetched via the service worker or disk cache.
