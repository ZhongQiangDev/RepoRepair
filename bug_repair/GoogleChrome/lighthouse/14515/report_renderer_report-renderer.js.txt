To address the issue of including emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor in the report meta block, we need to modify the `report-renderer.js` file. Specifically, we need to update the `devices` tooltip to include these additional details.

Here is the proposed *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
### report/renderer/report-renderer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
CPU/Memory Power: 595
CPU throttling: 4x slowdown (Simulated)
Axe version: 4.4.1
=======
CPU/Memory Power: 595
CPU throttling: 4x slowdown (Simulated)
Axe version: 4.4.1
Emulated screen dimensions: 1080x1920
Device scale factor: 2.625
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit assumes that the emulated screen dimensions and device scale factor values are hardcoded for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, these values should be dynamically fetched from the device configuration or settings.
