The issue is that the user timing marks are showing negative numbers, which indicates that the `navigationStartTime` is not being set correctly or is being used incorrectly when calculating the `startTime` for the user timing marks. The negative values suggest that the `navigationStartTime` is greater than the `startTime` of the user timing marks.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `navigationStartTime` is correctly set and used when calculating the `startTime` for the user timing marks. Specifically, we should ensure that `navigationStartTime` is only used for adjusting the `startTime` if it is defined and is less than the `startTime` of the user timing marks.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  userTimings.forEach(ut => {
    ut.startTime -= navigationStartTime;
    if (!ut.isMark) {
      ut.endTime -= navigationStartTime;
      ut.duration = ut.duration;
    }
  });
=======
  userTimings.forEach(ut => {
    if (navigationStartTime && ut.startTime >= navigationStartTime) {
      ut.startTime -= navigationStartTime;
      if (!ut.isMark) {
        ut.endTime -= navigationStartTime;
        ut.duration = ut.duration;
      }
    }
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `navigationStartTime` is only subtracted from `ut.startTime` if `navigationStartTime` is defined and `ut.startTime` is greater than or equal to `navigationStartTime`, preventing negative values for `ut.startTime`.
