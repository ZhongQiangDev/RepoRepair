The issue described is related to the rendering of lists in Markdown when there are spaces between them. The current implementation requires two spaces after a list before starting another list for correct rendering. This behavior is not standard in Markdown specifications and seems to be a quirk in the current implementation.

To fix this, we need to adjust the list parsing logic so that it correctly handles lists separated by any number of blank lines, not just two.

```javascript
###lib/marked.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
block.list = edit(block.list)
  .replace(/bull/g, block.bullet)
  .replace('hr', '\\n+(?=\\1?(?:(?:- *){3,}|(?:_ *){3,}|(?:\\* *){3,})(?:\\n+|$))')
  .replace('def', '\\n+(?=' + block.def.source + ')')
  .getRegex();
=======
block.list = edit(block.list)
  .replace(/bull/g, block.bullet)
  .replace('hr', '\\n+(?=\\1?(?:(?:- *){3,}|(?:_ *){3,}|(?:\\* *){3,})(?:\\n+|$))')
  .replace('def', '\\n+(?=' + block.def.source + ')')
  .replace('(?=\\n{2,}(?! )(?!\1bull )\\n*)', '(?=\\n+(?! )(?!\1bull )\\n*)') // Adjust to allow any number of blank lines
  .getRegex();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the regular expression used to match lists so that it allows for any number of blank lines between lists, rather than requiring exactly two. This should resolve the issue where lists are not rendered correctly when separated by only one blank line.
