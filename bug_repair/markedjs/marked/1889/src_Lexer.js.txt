The issue described is that lines with only spaces are being removed in code blocks, which can cause problems in certain programming languages or real-time editing scenarios. The root cause is the first line of the `blockTokens` function, which removes lines with only spaces using a regular expression.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the line that trims lines with only spaces from the `blockTokens` function. Here's the required *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
### src/Lexer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  blockTokens(src, tokens = [], top = true) {
    src = src.replace(/^ +$/gm, '');
=======
  blockTokens(src, tokens = [], top = true) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit removes the line that trims lines with only spaces, thus preserving them in code blocks.
