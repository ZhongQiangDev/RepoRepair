The issue described is related to the need to escape parentheses `(` with a backslash `\` in order for them to be properly rendered in the markdown output. This suggests that the current regex patterns used for parsing inline content are not correctly handling unescaped parentheses.

To fix this, we need to adjust the regex pattern for the `text` rule in the `inline` grammar to properly handle unescaped parentheses. Specifically, we need to ensure that parentheses are treated as regular text unless they are part of a link or other special syntax.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/marked.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
inline.text = /^(`+|[^`])[\s\S]*?(?=[\\<!\[`*]|\b_| {2,}\n|$)/
=======
inline.text = /^(`+|[^`])[\s\S]*?(?=[\\<!\[`*]|\(|\)|\b_| {2,}\n|$)/
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the `inline.text` regex to include `(` and `)` as characters that can terminate a text segment, ensuring that unescaped parentheses are treated as regular text rather than special syntax. This should resolve the issue where parentheses need to be escaped with a backslash to be properly rendered.
