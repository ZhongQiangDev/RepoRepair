The issue described is that the strikethrough markdown (`~~`) is not rendering correctly in certain cases. Specifically, the text `~~67890~` and `~13579~` are not being rendered as strikethrough. This suggests that the current implementation of the `del` method in the `Tokenizer` class is not handling these cases properly.

To fix this, we need to adjust the regular expression used in the `del` method to correctly match and handle these cases.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/Tokenizer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  del(src) {
    const cap = this.rules.inline.del.exec(src);
    if (cap) {
      return {
        type: 'del',
        raw: cap[0],
        text: cap[1]
      };
    }
  }
=======
  del(src) {
    const cap = this.rules.inline.del.exec(src);
    if (cap) {
      return {
        type: 'del',
        raw: cap[0],
        text: cap[1].replace(/^~~|~~$/g, '').replace(/^~|~$/g, '')
      };
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
1. The `del` method is modified to include additional logic to handle cases where the strikethrough markdown is not correctly matched.
2. The `text` property is updated to remove the leading and trailing `~~` or `~` characters using the `replace` method with appropriate regular expressions.
3. This ensures that the text inside the strikethrough markdown is correctly extracted and rendered.
