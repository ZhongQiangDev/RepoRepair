The issue described is that when a fenced code block follows a list and contains a blank line, it is not correctly recognized as a code block. This behavior is due to how the `list` method in the `Tokenizer` class handles the parsing of list items and their contents.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the blank lines within a fenced code block are properly handled and not prematurely ending the list item.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/Tokenizer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if (line.search(/[^ ]/) >= indent || !line.trim()) { // Dedent if possible
              itemContents += '\n' + line.slice(indent);
            } else if (!blankLine) { // Until blank line, item doesn't need indentation
              itemContents += '\n' + line;
            } else { // Otherwise, improper indentation ends this item
              break;
            }
=======
            if (line.search(/[^ ]/) >= indent || !line.trim()) { // Dedent if possible
              itemContents += '\n' + line.slice(indent);
            } else if (!blankLine && line.trim().startsWith('```')) { // Handle blank lines within fenced code blocks
              itemContents += '\n' + line;
            } else if (!blankLine) { // Until blank line, item doesn't need indentation
              itemContents += '\n' + line;
            } else { // Otherwise, improper indentation ends this item
              break;
            }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that blank lines within a fenced code block are correctly included in the list item's content, preventing the premature termination of the list item. The check for `line.trim().startsWith('```')` ensures that blank lines within fenced code blocks are handled appropriately.
