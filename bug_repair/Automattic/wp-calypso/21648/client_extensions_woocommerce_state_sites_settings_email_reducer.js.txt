The issue described is that an undecoded entity appears in the "From Name" field when the site title contains an encodable character. The problem seems to be related to the handling of the site title when it is used to populate the "From Name" field. The code provided does not directly handle the population of the "From Name" field, but it does include a function `decodeEntities` which could be relevant.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the site title is properly decoded before it is used to populate the "From Name" field. This likely needs to be done in the part of the code that sets the initial value of the "From Name" field.

Since the provided code segment does not show where the "From Name" field is populated, we need to assume that this happens in a different part of the code. However, we can still make a reasonable guess that the `decodeEntities` function should be used to decode the site title before it is used.

Here is a potential fix assuming that the "From Name" field is populated in a different part of the code:

```javascript
###client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/email/reducer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { decodeEntities } from 'lib/formatting';
=======
import { decodeEntities } from 'lib/formatting';

// Assuming the "From Name" field is populated in this reducer
[ WOOCOMMERCE_EMAIL_SETTINGS_REQUEST_SUCCESS ]: ( state, action ) => {
	const decodedSiteTitle = decodeEntities( action.siteTitle );
	return {
		...state,
		fromName: decodedSiteTitle,
	};
},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This assumes that the "From Name" field is populated in the `WOOCOMMERCE_EMAIL_SETTINGS_REQUEST_SUCCESS` action. If this is not the case, the fix would need to be applied in the correct part of the code where the "From Name" field is actually populated.
