The issue described is that the featured image from the Google library isn't being added correctly, and the post is published without the featured image. The problem seems to be related to the `setImage` function, which is responsible for setting the featured image. The function might not be correctly handling the image data from the Google library.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `setImage` function correctly handles the image data from the Google library and sets it as the featured image. We can do this by modifying the `setImage` function to properly handle the image data.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
setImage = value => {
	this.hideMediaModal();
	this.props.onImageSelected();

	if ( ! value ) {
		return;
	}

	this.props.editPost( this.props.siteId, this.props.postId, {
		featured_image: value.items[ 0 ].ID,
	} );

	stats.recordStat( 'featured_image_set' );
	stats.recordEvent( 'Featured image set' );

	this.props.recordTracksEvent( 'calypso_editor_featured_image_upload', {
		source: 'medialibrary',
		type: 'click',
	} );
};
=======
setImage = value => {
	this.hideMediaModal();
	this.props.onImageSelected();

	if ( ! value || !value.items || !value.items[0] ) {
		return;
	}

	// Ensure the image data is correctly handled for Google library images
	const imageId = value.items[0].ID || value.items[0].googleId;

	this.props.editPost( this.props.siteId, this.props.postId, {
		featured_image: imageId,
	} );

	stats.recordStat( 'featured_image_set' );
	stats.recordEvent( 'Featured image set' );

	this.props.recordTracksEvent( 'calypso_editor_featured_image_upload', {
		source: 'medialibrary',
		type: 'click',
	} );
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that the `setImage` function correctly handles the image data from the Google library by checking for the `googleId` if the `ID` is not available. This should resolve the issue of the featured image not being added correctly.
