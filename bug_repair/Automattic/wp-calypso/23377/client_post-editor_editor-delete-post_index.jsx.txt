The issue described is that after trashing a post, the user is immediately prompted to restore it, which is not the expected behavior. The user expects to see a success message or be redirected somewhere other than the editor with a restore message.

The problem seems to be that the post is being trashed, but the editor is not being redirected or updated to reflect the post's new status. The restore dialog is likely being triggered because the editor is still trying to load the trashed post.

To fix this, we need to ensure that after the post is trashed, the editor is redirected or updated to reflect the post's new status. This can be achieved by adding a redirect or updating the state to reflect the post's new status.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
###client/post-editor/editor-delete-post/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		actions.trash( this.props.site, this.props.post, error => {
			this.setState( { isTrashing: false } );

			if ( this.props.onTrashingPost ) {
				this.props.onTrashingPost( error );
			}
		} );
=======
		actions.trash( this.props.site, this.props.post, error => {
			this.setState( { isTrashing: false } );

			if ( error ) {
				// Handle error if needed
				console.error( 'Error trashing post:', error );
			} else {
				// Redirect or update state to reflect the post's new status
				if ( this.props.onTrashingPost ) {
					this.props.onTrashingPost( error );
				}
				// Redirect to a different page or update the editor state
				// For example, you might want to redirect to the posts list page
				// or update the editor state to show a success message
				// This is just an example, you might need to adjust it based on your application's structure
				window.location.href = '/posts'; // Redirect to posts list page
			}
		} );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
