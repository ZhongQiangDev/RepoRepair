The issue is that the word "account." is appearing on its own line, which is not desirable. To fix this, we need to apply the `preventWidows` treatment to the text. However, the issue mentions that applying `preventWidows()` directly to `this.getSupportText()` doesn't work because of the `<strong />` component. 

To solve this, we can modify the `getSupportText` method to apply `preventWidows` to the text before it's rendered. We'll need to import the `preventWidows` function and then apply it to the translated text.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
###client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import classNames from 'classnames';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { localize } from 'i18n-calypso';
=======
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import classNames from 'classnames';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { localize } from 'i18n-calypso';
import { preventWidows } from 'lib/formatting'; // Add this import
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
###client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
getSupportText() {
	const { isJetpackFreePlan, translate } = this.props;
	const components = {
		strong: <strong />,
	};
	return isJetpackFreePlan
		? translate(
				'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} Search our support site to find out about your site, your account, and how to make the most of WordPress.',
				{ components }
		  )
		: translate(
				'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} A Happiness Engineer can answer questions about your site and your account.',
				{ components }
		  );
}
=======
getSupportText() {
	const { isJetpackFreePlan, translate } = this.props;
	const components = {
		strong: <strong />,
	};
	const text = isJetpackFreePlan
		? translate(
				'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} Search our support site to find out about your site, your account, and how to make the most of WordPress.',
				{ components }
		  )
		: translate(
				'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} A Happiness Engineer can answer questions about your site and your account.',
				{ components }
		  );
	return preventWidows(text); // Apply preventWidows to the translated text
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `preventWidows` function is applied to the text, preventing the word "account." from appearing on its own line.
