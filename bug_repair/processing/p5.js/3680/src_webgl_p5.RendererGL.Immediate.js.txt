The issue described is related to the fill of certain shapes not working properly in WebGL mode. The problem is that the fill is creating a strange fill from the lower extremity of the letter C to the origin (top left of the letter). This is likely due to the way the vertices are being processed and rendered in WebGL mode.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the vertices are processed correctly and that the shape mode is set appropriately for the fill operation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the shape mode is set to `TRIANGLE_FAN` when filling a closed shape.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (this.drawMode === constants.FILL || this.drawMode === constants.TEXTURE) {
    switch (this.immediateMode.shapeMode) {
      case constants.LINE_STRIP:
      case constants.LINES:
      case constants.TRIANGLES:
        this.immediateMode.shapeMode =
          this.isBezier ||
          this.isQuadratic ||
          this.isCurve ||
          this.immediateMode.shapeMode === constants.TRIANGLES
            ? constants.TRIANGLES
            : constants.TRIANGLE_FAN;
        break;
    }
  } else {
    switch (this.immediateMode.shapeMode) {
      case constants.LINE_STRIP:
      case constants.LINES:
        this.immediateMode.shapeMode = constants.LINE_LOOP;
        break;
    }
  }
=======
  if (this.drawMode === constants.FILL || this.drawMode === constants.TEXTURE) {
    switch (this.immediateMode.shapeMode) {
      case constants.LINE_STRIP:
      case constants.LINES:
      case constants.TRIANGLES:
        this.immediateMode.shapeMode =
          this.isBezier ||
          this.isQuadratic ||
          this.isCurve ||
          this.immediateMode.shapeMode === constants.TRIANGLES
            ? constants.TRIANGLES
            : constants.TRIANGLE_FAN;
        break;
      case constants.POLYGON:
        this.immediateMode.shapeMode = constants.TRIANGLE_FAN;
        break;
    }
  } else {
    switch (this.immediateMode.shapeMode) {
      case constants.LINE_STRIP:
      case constants.LINES:
        this.immediateMode.shapeMode = constants.LINE_LOOP;
        break;
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when the shape mode is `POLYGON` and the draw mode is `FILL` or `TEXTURE`, the shape mode is set to `TRIANGLE_FAN`, which should correctly fill the shape without creating the strange fill from the lower extremity of the letter C to the origin.
