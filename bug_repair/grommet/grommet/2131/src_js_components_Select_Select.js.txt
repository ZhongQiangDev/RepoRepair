The issue is that the arrow icon for the Select component is not visible on a dark background. This is likely due to the color of the icon being set to 'brand', which may not have enough contrast against the dark background.

To fix this, we can change the color of the icon to a color that has better contrast against the dark background. We can use the 'control' color from the theme, which is typically a light color that works well on dark backgrounds.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Select/Select.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
              <SelectIcon color='brand' size={size} />
=======
              <SelectIcon color='control' size={size} />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
