The issue described is that the Grommet2 Calendar component is not displaying properly in Internet Explorer 11. The screenshot shows that the calendar is not rendering correctly, with some days missing or not aligned properly.

Given the code snippet provided, it seems that the issue might be related to the styling or the way the calendar is being rendered. Since the issue is specific to IE11, it's likely related to a CSS or JavaScript compatibility issue with that browser.

To address this, we need to ensure that the styles and JavaScript used in the Calendar component are compatible with IE11. This might involve adding polyfills, adjusting CSS properties, or modifying the JavaScript logic to be more compatible with older browsers.

However, the provided code snippet does not include the actual rendering logic or the styles for the Calendar component. Therefore, we need to make an educated guess based on common issues with IE11 and the Calendar component.

One common issue with IE11 is the lack of support for certain CSS properties and JavaScript features. For example, IE11 does not support the `flex` display property, which is commonly used for layout in modern web applications. If the Calendar component is using `flex` for its layout, it might not render correctly in IE11.

To fix this, we can add a polyfill for `flex` or use a different layout method that is compatible with IE11. We can also check if there are any JavaScript features used in the Calendar component that are not supported by IE11 and add polyfills for them.

Here is a potential fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { Box } from '../Box';
import { Button } from '../Button';
import { Keyboard } from '../Keyboard';
import { Heading } from '../Heading';
import { Text } from '../Text';

import { withTheme } from '../hocs';

import StyledCalendar, {
  StyledDay, StyledDayContainer, StyledWeek, StyledWeeks, StyledWeeksContainer,
} from './StyledCalendar';
=======
import { Box } from '../Box';
import { Button } from '../Button';
import { Keyboard } from '../Keyboard';
import { Heading } from '../Heading';
import { Text } from '../Text';

import { withTheme } from '../hocs';

// Add a polyfill for flexbox in IE11
import 'flexboxgrid';

import StyledCalendar, {
  StyledDay, StyledDayContainer, StyledWeek, StyledWeeks, StyledWeeksContainer,
} from './StyledCalendar';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a polyfill for `flexbox` in IE11, which should help ensure that the Calendar component renders correctly in that browser. If there are other JavaScript features used in the Calendar component that are not supported by IE11, we may need to add additional polyfills or modify the code to be more compatible with older browsers.
