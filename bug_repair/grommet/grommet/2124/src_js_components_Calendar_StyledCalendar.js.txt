The issue described is that the Grommet2 Calendar is not displaying properly in Internet Explorer 11. The screenshot shows that the calendar is not rendering correctly, with some elements missing or misaligned. This is likely due to the use of CSS Flexbox properties that are not fully supported in IE11.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the Flexbox properties used in the `StyledDay` and `StyledWeek` components are compatible with IE11. Specifically, the `flex-justify` property is not supported in IE11, and we should use `justify-content` instead.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const StyledWeek = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-justify: between;
`;
=======
export const StyledWeek = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
`;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we should ensure that the `StyledDay` component is also compatible with IE11. The `justify-content` and `align-items` properties should be used instead of any non-standard Flexbox properties.

```javascript
### src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const StyledDay = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
`;
=======
export const StyledDay = styled.div`
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
  -ms-flex-pack: center;
  justify-content: center;
  -ms-flex-align: center;
  align-items: center;
`;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should ensure that the Calendar component is displayed properly in IE11.
