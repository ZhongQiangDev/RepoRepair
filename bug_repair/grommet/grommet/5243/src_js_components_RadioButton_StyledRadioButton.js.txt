The issue is that the background color is being applied to all radio buttons instead of just the checked one. This is likely because the background color is being applied to the `StyledRadioButtonBox` component regardless of whether the radio button is checked or not.

To fix this, we need to conditionally apply the background color only when the radio button is checked. We can do this by checking the `checked` property of the `StyledRadioButtonInput` component and applying the background color only when it is `true`.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const StyledRadioButtonBox = styled.div`
  background-color: ${(props) =>
    normalizeColor(
      props.theme.radioButton.check.background?.color,
      props.theme,
    )};


`;
=======
const StyledRadioButtonBox = styled.div`
  background-color: ${(props) =>
    props.checked
      ? normalizeColor(
          props.theme.radioButton.check.background?.color,
          props.theme,
        )
      : 'transparent'};


`;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit will apply the background color only when the radio button is checked, and set the background color to `transparent` when it is not checked. This should fix the issue of the background color being applied to all radio buttons.
