The issue described is related to the form validation status not updating correctly when dynamically adding and removing required fields. The problem seems to be in how the validation rules and required fields are managed when fields are dynamically added or removed.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the validation rules and required fields are properly updated when a field is removed from the form. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `requiredFields` array is updated when a required field is removed.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Form/Form.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        const index = requiredFields.current.indexOf(name);
        if (required) {
          if (index === -1) requiredFields.current.push(name);
        } else if (index !== -1) requiredFields.current.splice(index, 1);

        if (validateArg || required) {
          if (!validationRulesRef.current[name]) {
            validationRulesRef.current[name] = {};
          }
          validationRulesRef.current[name].field = validateName(
            validateArg,
            required,
          );
          return () => delete validationRulesRef.current[name].field;
        }
=======
        const index = requiredFields.current.indexOf(name);
        if (required) {
          if (index === -1) requiredFields.current.push(name);
        } else if (index !== -1) {
          requiredFields.current.splice(index, 1);
        }

        if (validateArg || required) {
          if (!validationRulesRef.current[name]) {
            validationRulesRef.current[name] = {};
          }
          validationRulesRef.current[name].field = validateName(
            validateArg,
            required,
          );
          return () => {
            delete validationRulesRef.current[name];
            const index = requiredFields.current.indexOf(name);
            if (index !== -1) {
              requiredFields.current.splice(index, 1);
            }
          };
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when a required field is removed, it is also removed from the `requiredFields` array. This should resolve the issue where the form remains invalid even after removing a required field.
