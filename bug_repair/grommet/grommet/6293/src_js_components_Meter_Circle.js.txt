The issue seems to be related to how the `Circle` component is rendering the paths for the meter values. Specifically, the problem might be in the logic that calculates the `endAngle` for each value. The current logic might be causing the angles to overlap or not be calculated correctly, leading to only the last value being rendered.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `endAngle` is calculated correctly for each value, and that the paths are added in the correct order.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      let endAngle;
      if (startValue + value >= max) {
        endAngle = type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360;
      } else {
        endAngle = translateEndAngle(startAngle, anglePer, value);
      }
=======
      let endAngle = translateEndAngle(startAngle, anglePer, value);
      if (startValue + value >= max) {
        endAngle = type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360;
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `endAngle` is calculated first using `translateEndAngle`, and then adjusted if the sum of `startValue` and `value` exceeds the `max` value. This should help in rendering all the values correctly.

Additionally, we should ensure that the paths are added in the correct order. The current logic uses `unshift` to add paths to the beginning of the array, which might cause issues. We can change this to use `push` instead:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        paths.unshift(
          <path
            key={key}
            d={d1}
            fill="none"
            {...stroke}
            strokeWidth={strokeWidth}
            strokeLinecap="round"
            {...hoverProps}
            {...pathRest}
          />,
        );
=======
        paths.push(
          <path
            key={key}
            d={d1}
            fill="none"
            {...stroke}
            strokeWidth={strokeWidth}
            strokeLinecap="round"
            {...hoverProps}
            {...pathRest}
          />,
        );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And similarly for the `pathCaps`:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        pathCaps.unshift(pathCap);
=======
        pathCaps.push(pathCap);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should help in rendering all the values correctly in the `Circle` meter.
