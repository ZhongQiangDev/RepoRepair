The issue statement does not directly indicate a bug in the provided code segments. Instead, it suggests updating the `scratch-vm` dependency to the latest version and mentions implementing a feature related to "run without screen refresh" in custom procedures modal. However, the code provided does not seem to directly relate to these specific tasks.

Given the context, the primary action would be to update the `scratch-vm` dependency version in the `package.json` file. However, since the code provided is from `blocks.jsx`, and there are no direct bugs mentioned in the issue statement related to this file, no direct SEARCH/REPLACE edits are necessary for this file based on the given issue.

If the intention is to update the `scratch-vm` version, the edit would be in the `package.json` file, not in `blocks.jsx`. Here's how you might update the `scratch-vm` version in `package.json`:

```javascript
### package.json
<<<<<<< SEARCH
"scratch-vm": "0.1.0-prerelease.1513627112-prerelease.1513627124",
=======
"scratch-vm": "0.1.0-prerelease.1513710334-prerelease.1513710351",
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Since the issue does not point out any specific bugs in the `blocks.jsx` file, no changes are required in this file based on the provided information. If there are additional requirements or bugs identified later, those would need to be addressed separately.
