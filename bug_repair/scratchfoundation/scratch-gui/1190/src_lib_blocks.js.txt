The issue statement does not directly point to a bug in the provided code segments. Instead, it discusses updating the `scratch-vm` dependency to the latest version and mentions implementing "run without screen refresh" in custom procedures modal, which is a separate task not directly related to the code provided.

However, if we assume that the issue is related to ensuring that the `scratch-vm` dependency is updated and that the code is compatible with the new version, we can focus on updating the version range for the `scratch-vm` dependency in the `package.json` file.

Since the code provided does not include the `package.json` file, I will provide a hypothetical edit for updating the `scratch-vm` version in `package.json`.

```javascript
### package.json
<<<<<<< SEARCH
"scratch-vm": "0.1.0-prerelease.1513627112-prerelease.1513627124",
=======
"scratch-vm": "0.1.0-prerelease.1513710334-prerelease.1513710351",
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit assumes that the `package.json` file contains a line specifying the version of `scratch-vm` and that this line needs to be updated to the latest version mentioned in the issue statement.

If there are specific bugs in the provided code segments related to the issue, they are not mentioned in the issue statement. Therefore, no further edits are provided based on the given information.
