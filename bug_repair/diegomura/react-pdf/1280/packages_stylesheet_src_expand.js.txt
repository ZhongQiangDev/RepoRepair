The issue described is that the `flexBasis` property is not working as expected after upgrading from version 1.6.14 to 2.0.8. The code provided in the issue uses `flexBasis` with percentage values, but the layout does not reflect the intended sizes.

The problem seems to be in the `processFlexBasis` function, which is not correctly handling the percentage values. The function currently splits the value by spaces and returns the third element, which is incorrect for percentage values.

To fix this, we need to modify the `processFlexBasis` function to correctly handle percentage values and return the appropriate numeric value.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const processFlexBasis = (key, value) => {
  if (isNumber(value)) return value;
  const matches = value.split(' ');
  return matches[2];
};
=======
const processFlexBasis = (key, value) => {
  if (isNumber(value)) return value;
  if (typeof value === 'string' && value.endsWith('%')) {
    return parseFloat(value) / 100;
  }
  return value;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit changes the `processFlexBasis` function to check if the value is a string ending with a percentage sign. If it is, it converts the value to a float and divides it by 100 to get the correct numeric value. This should resolve the issue with the `flexBasis` property not working as expected.
