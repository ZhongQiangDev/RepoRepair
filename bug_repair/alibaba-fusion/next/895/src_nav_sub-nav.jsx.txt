The issue is that in `iconOnly` mode, items without an icon are showing a blank space. The code currently adds a placeholder span when there is no icon, which results in the blank space. To fix this, we should not render anything when there is no icon in `iconOnly` mode.

Here is the fix:

```javascript
### src/nav/sub-nav.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            } else if (!iconEl) {
                iconEl = <span className={`${prefix}nav-icon-placeholder`} />;
            }
=======
            } else if (!iconEl) {
                iconEl = null;
            }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
