The issue is that in `iconOnly` mode, items without an icon are still showing a blank space where the icon should be. The code currently adds a placeholder span when `iconOnly` is true and `iconEl` is falsy. However, this placeholder span is still taking up space, causing the blank space issue.

To fix this, we should only render the `iconEl` if it is truthy. If `iconEl` is falsy and `iconOnly` is true, we should not render anything for the icon.

Here is the fix:

```javascript
### src/nav/item.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (iconOnly && !iconEl) {
            iconEl = <span className={`${prefix}nav-icon-placeholder`} />;
        }

        const item = (
            <Menu.Item {...others}>
                {iconEl}
                {children}
            </Menu.Item>
        );
=======
        const item = (
            <Menu.Item {...others}>
                {iconEl && iconEl}
                {children}
            </Menu.Item>
        );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if `iconEl` is falsy, nothing will be rendered for the icon, thus eliminating the blank space.
