The issue is that the `itemRender` function does not support the delete functionality. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `itemRender` function receives the necessary props to handle the delete action.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/upload/card.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                itemRender={itemRender}
=======
                itemRender={(item, index, listProps) => {
                    if (typeof itemRender === 'function') {
                        return itemRender(item, index, { ...listProps, onRemove: listProps.onRemove });
                    }
                    return null;
                }}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `itemRender` function receives the `onRemove` prop, which can be used to handle the delete action. The `itemRender` function will now have access to the `onRemove` function, allowing it to trigger the delete action when needed.
