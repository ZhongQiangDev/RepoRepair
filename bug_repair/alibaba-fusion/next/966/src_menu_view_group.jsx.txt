The issue arises because the `children` prop in the `Group` component is being treated as an array of children, but when there is a single child with a space in the label, it is being split into multiple children, causing the `map` function to fail when it tries to access properties on `undefined`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `children` is always treated as an array, even if it contains a single child. We can achieve this by using `React.Children.toArray` to convert `children` into an array.

Here is the fix:

```javascript
### src/menu/view/group.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        const newChildren = children.map(child => {
            const { className } = child.props;
            const newChildClassName = cx({
                [`${prefix}menu-group-item`]: true,
                [className]: !!className,
            });

            return cloneElement(child, {
                parentMode,
                className: newChildClassName,
            });
        });
=======
        const newChildren = React.Children.toArray(children).map(child => {
            const { className } = child.props;
            const newChildClassName = cx({
                [`${prefix}menu-group-item`]: true,
                [className]: !!className,
            });

            return cloneElement(child, {
                parentMode,
                className: newChildClassName,
            });
        });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `children` is always treated as an array, even if it contains a single child, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
