The issue is about controlling the visibility of the search boxes separately in the Transfer component. The current `showSearch` prop only controls the visibility of both search boxes together. To address this, we need to add new props to control the visibility of the left and right search boxes separately.

Here's the proposed solution:

1. Add new props `leftShowSearch` and `rightShowSearch` to control the visibility of the left and right search boxes separately.
2. Update the `showSearch` prop to be deprecated and use the new props instead.

```typescript
### types/transfer/index.d.ts
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * 是否显示搜索框
     */
    showSearch?: boolean;
=======
    /**
     * 是否显示左侧搜索框
     */
    leftShowSearch?: boolean;

    /**
     * 是否显示右侧搜索框
     */
    rightShowSearch?: boolean;

    /**
     * @deprecated Use `leftShowSearch` and `rightShowSearch` instead.
     */
    showSearch?: boolean;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will allow the user to control the visibility of the search boxes separately, addressing the issue described in the chat and the issue text.
