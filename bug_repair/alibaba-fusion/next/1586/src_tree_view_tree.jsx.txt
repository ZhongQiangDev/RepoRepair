The issue described is that the `selected` property in the `extra` parameter of the `onSelect` callback does not toggle correctly when a node is clicked multiple times. The `selected` value becomes `false` after the first click and does not change thereafter.

The problem seems to be in the `handleSelect` method where the `selected` state is not being updated correctly. Specifically, the `selected` value is not being toggled properly.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/tree/view/tree.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    handleSelect(select, key, node, e) {
        const { multiple, onSelect } = this.props;
        let selectedKeys = [...this.state.selectedKeys];
        if (multiple) {
            this.processKey(selectedKeys, key, select);
        } else {
            selectedKeys = [key];
        }

        if (!('selectedKeys' in this.props)) {
            this.setState({ selectedKeys });
        }
        onSelect(selectedKeys, {
            selectedNodes: this.getNodes(selectedKeys),
            node,
            selected: select,
            event: e,
        });
    }
=======
    handleSelect(key, node, e) {
        const { multiple, onSelect } = this.props;
        let selectedKeys = [...this.state.selectedKeys];
        const isSelected = selectedKeys.includes(key);

        if (multiple) {
            if (isSelected) {
                this.processKey(selectedKeys, key, false);
            } else {
                this.processKey(selectedKeys, key, true);
            }
        } else {
            if (isSelected) {
                selectedKeys = [];
            } else {
                selectedKeys = [key];
            }
        }

        if (!('selectedKeys' in this.props)) {
            this.setState({ selectedKeys });
        }
        onSelect(selectedKeys, {
            selectedNodes: this.getNodes(selectedKeys),
            node,
            selected: !isSelected,
            event: e,
        });
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `selected` value is toggled correctly based on whether the node is already selected or not. The `isSelected` variable checks if the node is currently selected, and then updates the `selectedKeys` array accordingly. The `selected` value in the `extra` parameter is set to the opposite of `isSelected`, ensuring it toggles correctly.
