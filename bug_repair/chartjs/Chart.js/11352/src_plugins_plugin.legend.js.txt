The issue described is related to the incorrect handling of multi-line labels in the legend, where clicking on a label performs the action on the label above it. This is likely due to incorrect positioning or sizing of the hitboxes for the legend items.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the hitboxes for each legend item are correctly calculated and positioned, especially when dealing with multi-line labels. The `_fitCols` method seems to be responsible for calculating the hitboxes for vertical legends, and it might need adjustments to handle multi-line labels properly.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const {itemWidth, itemHeight} = calculateItemSize(boxWidth, labelFont, ctx, legendItem, _itemHeight);
=======
    const {itemWidth, itemHeight} = calculateItemSize(boxWidth, labelFont, ctx, legendItem, _itemHeight);
    // Adjust itemHeight for multi-line labels
    if (typeof legendItem.text === 'string') {
        itemHeight += (legendItem.text.split('\n').length - 1) * fontSize;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adjusts the `itemHeight` for multi-line labels by adding the height of additional lines. This should ensure that the hitboxes are correctly sized and positioned for multi-line labels, fixing the issue where clicking on a label performs the action on the label above it.
