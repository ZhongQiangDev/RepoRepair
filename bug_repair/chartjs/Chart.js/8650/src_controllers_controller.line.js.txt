The issue described is that the rightmost data point in the line chart is getting cropped off. This is likely due to the chart not accounting for the size of the data points when calculating the chart area. The `getMaxOverflow` method in the `LineController` class is responsible for calculating the overflow, which is used to ensure that data points are not cropped. However, it seems that the current implementation might not be sufficient for all cases.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the chart area is adjusted to accommodate the size of the data points, especially the rightmost one. We can do this by increasing the overflow value returned by the `getMaxOverflow` method.

Here is the proposed fix:

```typescript
### src/controllers/controller.line.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * @protected
   */
  getMaxOverflow() {
    const me = this;
    const meta = me._cachedMeta;
    const border = meta.dataset.options.borderWidth || 0;
    const data = meta.data || [];
    if (!data.length) {
      return border;
    }
    const firstPoint = data[0].size();
    const lastPoint = data[data.length - 1].size();
    return Math.max(border, firstPoint, lastPoint) / 2;
  }
=======
  /**
   * @protected
   */
  getMaxOverflow() {
    const me = this;
    const meta = me._cachedMeta;
    const border = meta.dataset.options.borderWidth || 0;
    const data = meta.data || [];
    if (!data.length) {
      return border;
    }
    const firstPoint = data[0].size();
    const lastPoint = data[data.length - 1].size();
    // Increase the overflow to ensure the rightmost data point is not cropped
    return Math.max(border, firstPoint, lastPoint) + 5; // Add a small buffer
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change increases the overflow value by adding a small buffer (5 pixels in this case), which should help ensure that the rightmost data point is not cropped off. You can adjust the buffer size as needed based on the specific requirements and the size of the data points.
