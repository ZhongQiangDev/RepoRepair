The issue described is that the rightmost data point in the line chart is getting cropped off. This is likely due to the chart not accounting for the padding or margin needed to display the last data point fully. To fix this, we need to adjust the chart's layout to ensure there is enough space for the last data point.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/core/core.layouts.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    chartArea.x = x;
    chartArea.y = y;
=======
    // Add padding to the right side to ensure the last data point is not cropped
    const padding = chart.options.layout.padding;
    chartArea.x = x + padding.right;
    chartArea.y = y;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds padding to the right side of the chart area, ensuring that the last data point is not cropped off. The padding value can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the chart.
