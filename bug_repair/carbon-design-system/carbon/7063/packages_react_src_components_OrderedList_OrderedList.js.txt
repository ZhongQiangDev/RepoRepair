The issue described is related to the custom counter reset in the CSS that affects the ordered list in Firefox. The solution involves removing or overriding the `counter-reset: item` style to allow the native ordered list styling to work correctly.

Since the issue is related to the CSS rather than the React component itself, we need to modify the CSS file associated with the `OrderedList` component. However, the provided code segment is from the React component file, not the CSS file. Therefore, we need to locate the relevant CSS file and make the necessary changes there.

Assuming the CSS file is located in the same directory as the React component and is named `_list.scss`, here's how you can modify it:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/_list.scss
<<<<<<< SEARCH
.bx--list--ordered: not(.bx--list--nested) {
  counter-reset: item;
}
=======
.bx--list--ordered: not(.bx--list--nested) {
  /* Remove the custom counter reset to allow native ordered list styling */
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will remove the custom counter reset, allowing the native ordered list styling to work correctly in Firefox. If you need to keep the custom counter reset for other purposes, you can add a conditional class or use a different selector to target only the specific cases where you want to use the native styling.
