The issue arises because the `displayName` of the `children.type` is not being set correctly due to the use of `createComponentToggle`, which wraps the original component with a `FeatureToggle` component. This causes the `displayName` check to fail, leading to the shark fin and offset not being applied.

To fix this, we need to modify the check for the `OverflowMenu` component to account for the `FeatureToggle` wrapper. We can do this by checking if the `displayName` includes `'OverflowMenu'` instead of strictly equaling `'OverflowMenu'`.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/BreadcrumbItem.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
if (
  children.type &&
  children.type.displayName !== undefined &&
  children.type.displayName === 'OverflowMenu'
) {
=======
if (
  children.type &&
  children.type.displayName !== undefined &&
  children.type.displayName.includes('OverflowMenu')
) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the `OverflowMenu` component is correctly identified even when wrapped by `FeatureToggle`, thus applying the shark fin and offset as expected.
