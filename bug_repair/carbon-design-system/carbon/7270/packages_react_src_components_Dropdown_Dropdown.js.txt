The issue described is that the `ref` passed to the `Dropdown` component is not being correctly forwarded to the underlying button element, resulting in `undefined` when trying to access it. The problem lies in how the `ref` is being handled within the `Dropdown` component.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `ref` is correctly forwarded to the button element inside the `ListBox` component. Here's the necessary change:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <button
          type="button"
          ref={ref}
          className={`${prefix}--list-box__field`}
          disabled={disabled}
          aria-disabled={disabled}
          {...getToggleButtonProps()}>
=======
        <button
          type="button"
          ref={React.forwardRef((buttonRef, propsRef) => {
            if (typeof ref === 'function') {
              ref(buttonRef);
            } else if (ref) {
              ref.current = buttonRef;
            }
            return buttonRef;
          })}
          className={`${prefix}--list-box__field`}
          disabled={disabled}
          aria-disabled={disabled}
          {...getToggleButtonProps()}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `ref` is correctly forwarded to the button element inside the `ListBox` component. The `React.forwardRef` function is used to create a new ref that correctly handles both function and object refs. This should resolve the issue of the `ref` being `undefined` when accessed.
