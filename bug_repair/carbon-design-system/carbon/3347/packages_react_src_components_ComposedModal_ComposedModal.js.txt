The issue is that the `ComposedModal` component is setting the `kind` property of the secondary button to `'tertiary'` when the `danger` prop is true, instead of `'secondary'` as expected. To fix this, we need to change the conditional statement in the `ModalFooter` component to set the `kind` property to `'secondary'` when `danger` is true.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}
=======
kind={danger ? 'secondary' : 'secondary'}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the secondary button in the `ComposedModal` component has the same styling as the secondary button in the `Modal` component when the `danger` prop is true.
