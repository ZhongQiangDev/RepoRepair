The issue described in the bug report is related to the destructuring of the `DataTable` components from `@carbon/react`. When destructuring the components from `DataTable`, the application breaks due to incorrect import handling. The solution is to import the components directly from `@carbon/react` instead of destructuring them from `DataTable`.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### App.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { DataTable } from '@carbon/react'

const {
  TableContainer,
  Table,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
  TableHeader,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
} = DataTable;
=======
import {
  DataTable,
  TableContainer,
  Table,
  TableHead,
  TableRow,
  TableHeader,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
} from '@carbon/react';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit changes the import statement to directly import the necessary components from `@carbon/react`, which resolves the issue as described in the bug report.
