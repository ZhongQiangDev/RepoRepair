To address the issue of text wrapping in the CodeSnippet component, we need to add a CSS style that enables text wrapping for the `<pre>` element inside the CodeSnippet. Additionally, we can add a max size for the container to ensure the text wraps properly.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <pre ref={codeContentRef}>{children}</pre>
=======
        <pre ref={codeContentRef} style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', wordWrap: 'break-word', maxWidth: '100%' }}>{children}</pre>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds the necessary CSS styles to the `<pre>` element to enable text wrapping and set a maximum width for the container. The `whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'` property allows the text to wrap at line breaks and spaces, while `wordWrap: 'break-word'` ensures that long words are broken and wrapped to the next line. The `maxWidth: '100%'` property ensures that the container does not exceed its parent's width.

If you want to report the number of columns displayed, you can add a function to calculate the number of columns based on the width of the container and the average character width. However, this is not directly related to the text wrapping issue and can be addressed separately if needed.
