The issue is that the skeleton text is not vertically aligned with the dotted circles in the vertical progress indicator. To fix this, we need to adjust the CSS for the skeleton text so that it is vertically aligned with the circles.

Here's the proposed fix:

```typescript
###packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      <p className={`${prefix}--progress-label`} />
=======
      <p className={`${prefix}--progress-label`} style={{ verticalAlign: 'middle' }} />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds an inline style to the `<p>` element that contains the skeleton text, setting its `verticalAlign` property to `middle`. This should align the text vertically with the dotted circles.

If the issue persists after this change, we may need to inspect the CSS styles applied to the elements and make further adjustments.
