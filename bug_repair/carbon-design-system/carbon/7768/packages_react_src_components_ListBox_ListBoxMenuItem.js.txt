The issue described is that the VoiceOver screen reader reads the dropdown items twice. This is likely due to the structure of the `ListBoxMenuItem` component, where the content is wrapped in an additional `div` with the class `--list-box__menu-item__option`. This additional wrapper might be causing the screen reader to read the content twice.

To fix this, we can remove the unnecessary `div` wrapper and directly render the `children` inside the `ListBoxMenuItem` component.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  return (
    <div className={className} {...rest}>
      <div className={`${prefix}--list-box__menu-item__option`}>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
=======
  return (
    <div className={className} {...rest}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the content is not wrapped in an additional `div`, which should prevent the VoiceOver from reading the items twice.
