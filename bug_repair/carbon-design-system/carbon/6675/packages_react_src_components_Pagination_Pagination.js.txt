To address the issue of displaying singular forms for "item" and "page" when there is only one item or one page, we need to modify the `itemRangeText` and `pageRangeText` functions to include conditional logic for singular forms.

Here's the required *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    itemRangeText: (min, max, total) => `${min}–${max} of ${total} items`,
    pageRangeText: (current, total) => `of ${total} pages`,
=======
    itemRangeText: (min, max, total) => `${min}–${max} of ${total} ${total === 1 ? 'item' : 'items'}`,
    pageRangeText: (current, total) => `of ${total} ${total === 1 ? 'page' : 'pages'}`,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when `total` is 1, the singular form of the noun is used. For example, if there is only one item, it will display "1-1 of 1 item" instead of "1-1 of 1 items". Similarly, if there is only one page, it will display "of 1 page" instead of "of 1 pages".
