The issue described is that when the calendar is opened by clicking the calendar icon, it's not possible to select a date using the keyboard arrows. However, when the calendar is opened by clicking the input field, keyboard navigation works fine. This suggests that the keyboard event listeners are not being properly attached when the calendar is opened via the icon.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the keyboard event listeners are added regardless of how the calendar is opened. Specifically, we should add the keyboard event listeners in the `onOpen` callback of the flatpickr configuration.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
          onOpen: (...args) => {
            const { onOpen } = this.props;
            onHook(...args);
            if (onOpen) {
              onOpen(...args);
            }
          },
=======
          onOpen: (...args) => {
            const { onOpen } = this.props;
            onHook(...args);
            if (onOpen) {
              onOpen(...args);
            }
            this.addKeyboardEvents(this.cal); // Add keyboard events when the calendar opens
          },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `addKeyboardEvents` method is called whenever the calendar is opened, whether it's through the input field or the calendar icon. This should resolve the issue of keyboard navigation not working when the calendar is opened via the icon.
