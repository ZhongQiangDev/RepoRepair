The issue is that the `TableSelectRow` component is not applying the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class to the `td` element, which is causing the row height discrepancy. To fix this, we need to add the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class to the `td` element in the `TableSelectRow` component.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectRow.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    <td className={className}>
=======
    <td className={`bx--table-column-checkbox ${className}`}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit will ensure that the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class is always applied to the `td` element, along with any other classes that may be passed in via the `className` prop. This should resolve the row height discrepancy and align the React implementation with the Carbon Design System's expectations.
