The issue is related to the padding of the `IconButton` component. The problem seems to be that the `IconButton` is using the padding from the `Button` component, which is not appropriate for an icon button. To fix this, we need to adjust the padding specifically for the `IconButton`.

Here's the proposed fix:

```typescript
###packages/react/src/components/IconButton/index.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      <Button {...rest} kind={kind} ref={ref} size={size}>
        {children}
      </Button>
=======
      <Button {...rest} kind={kind} ref={ref} size={size} className={`${prefix}--btn--icon`}>
        {children}
      </Button>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to add the appropriate CSS class for the `IconButton` padding. This can be done by adding the following CSS:

```css
/* Add this to the appropriate CSS file */
.ibm--btn--icon {
  padding: 0;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

This will ensure that the `IconButton` has the correct padding and size.
