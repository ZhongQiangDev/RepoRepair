The issue is that the inputs within the modal are not spanning the full width as expected. This is likely due to missing CSS styles that define the width of the input fields. Since the provided code is the React component for the modal, the fix would involve adding the appropriate CSS styles to ensure the inputs span the full width.

However, since the code provided is the JavaScript/React part and not the CSS, we need to assume that the CSS is defined elsewhere. The fix would involve modifying the CSS file that styles the modal inputs.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit assuming the CSS is in a separate file:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.css
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/* Existing CSS for modal inputs */
=======
/* Ensure modal inputs span full width */
.bx--modal-content input {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Existing CSS for modal inputs */
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

If the CSS is inline or within a styled-components file, the search and replace would target the relevant CSS block within that file. For example:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const ModalContent = styled.div`
  /* Existing styles */
`;
=======
const ModalContent = styled.div`
  /* Existing styles */
  input {
    width: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
`;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This ensures that any input elements within the modal content will span the full width of their container.
