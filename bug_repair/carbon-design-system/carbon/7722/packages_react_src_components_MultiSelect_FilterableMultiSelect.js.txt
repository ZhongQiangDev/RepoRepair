The issue described is that the focus outline appears on the wrong node when clicking on the `<input>` of a filterable multiselect. The focus should be on the entire control instead of just the `<input>`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the focus is applied to the correct element when the `<input>` is clicked. This can be achieved by modifying the `getInputProps` method to include a `ref` that focuses on the parent element instead of the `<input>`.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    <input
                      className={inputClasses}
                      aria-controls={`${id}__menu`}
                      aria-autocomplete="list"
                      ref={(el) => (this.inputNode = el)}
                      id={`${id}-input`}
                      {...getInputProps({
                        disabled,
                        placeholder,
                        onKeyDown: this.handleOnInputKeyDown,
                      })}
                    />
=======
                    <input
                      className={inputClasses}
                      aria-controls={`${id}__menu`}
                      aria-autocomplete="list"
                      ref={(el) => {
                        this.inputNode = el;
                        if (el) {
                          el.addEventListener('focus', () => {
                            this.inputNode.parentElement.focus();
                          });
                        }
                      }}
                      id={`${id}-input`}
                      {...getInputProps({
                        disabled,
                        placeholder,
                        onKeyDown: this.handleOnInputKeyDown,
                      })}
                    />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures that when the `<input>` receives focus, the focus is immediately transferred to its parent element, which is the entire control. This should resolve the issue of the focus outline appearing on the wrong node.
