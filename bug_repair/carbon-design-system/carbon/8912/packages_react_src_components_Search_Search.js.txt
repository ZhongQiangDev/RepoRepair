The issue is that the search field height is too small, and it should be 40 or 48px. The problem seems to be related to the CSS classes applied to the search field. The `size` prop is used to determine the size of the search field, but it seems that the default size is not being set correctly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the default size is set to 'md' (which corresponds to 40px) or 'lg' (which corresponds to 48px) if the `size` prop is not provided.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      size = !small ? '' : 'sm',
=======
      size = !small ? 'md' : 'sm',
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change sets the default size to 'md' if the `size` prop is not provided, which should result in a search field height of 40px. If you want the default size to be 48px, you can change 'md' to 'lg'.
