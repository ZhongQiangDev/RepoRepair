To address the issue described, we need to improve the documentation for the `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` props in the Toggle component. Additionally, we should consider whether the `aria-labelledby` prop should be required when `hideLabel` is set to `true`. 

Here are the proposed changes:

1. Update the documentation for `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` props.
2. Consider removing the requirement for `aria-labelledby` when `hideLabel` is `true`.

### SEARCH/REPLACE Edits

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * If true, the side labels (props.labelA and props.labelB) will be replaced by
 * props.labelText, so that the toggle doesn't render a top label. In order to fully
 * hide any labels, you can use props['aria-labelledby'] to refer to another element
 * that labels the toggle. props.labelText would no longer be required in that case
 * and can therefore be omitted.
 */
hideLabel: PropTypes.bool,
/**
 * Specify another element's id to be used as the label for this toggle
 */
'aria-labelledby': PropTypes.string,
=======
/**
 * If true, the side labels (props.labelA and props.labelB) will be replaced by
 * props.labelText, so that the toggle doesn't render a top label. When `hideLabel` is `true`, 
 * the label will be visually hidden. To ensure accessibility, you can use `aria-labelledby` 
 * to refer to another element that labels the toggle. However, `aria-labelledby` is not 
 * strictly required as the `for` attribute on the label can also be used for A11Y compliance.
 */
hideLabel: PropTypes.bool,
/**
 * Specify another element's id to be used as the label for this toggle. This is useful 
 * when `hideLabel` is `true` and you want to ensure accessibility by linking the toggle 
 * to another label element. However, it is not strictly required as the `for` attribute 
 * on the label can also be used for A11Y compliance.
 */
'aria-labelledby': PropTypes.string,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Additional Consideration

To simplify the usage and make it more intuitive, we can remove the requirement for `aria-labelledby` when `hideLabel` is `true`. This can be done by updating the component logic to handle the `for` attribute on the label as well.

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const renderSideLabel = !(hideLabel && ariaLabelledby);
const LabelComponent = ariaLabelledby ? 'div' : 'label';
=======
const renderSideLabel = !hideLabel;
const LabelComponent = 'label';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will improve the documentation and make the component more user-friendly by reducing the complexity of using `aria-labelledby` when `hideLabel` is `true`.
