The issue described is related to the positioning of the copy button in the `single` mode of the CodeSnippet component. The problem arises because the `.bx--copy-btn` class is setting the `position` to `relative` instead of `absolute`. To fix this, we need to ensure that the copy button is positioned correctly by adjusting the CSS styles.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      <CopyButton
        className={`${prefix}--snippet-button`}
        onClick={onClick}
        feedback={feedback}
        iconDescription={copyButtonDescription}
      />
=======
      <CopyButton
        className={`${prefix}--snippet-button`}
        style={{ position: 'absolute', top: '0', right: '0' }}
        onClick={onClick}
        feedback={feedback}
        iconDescription={copyButtonDescription}
      />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the copy button is positioned absolutely within its parent container, which should resolve the positioning issue. However, if the issue persists or if there are additional styling concerns, further adjustments to the CSS might be necessary.
