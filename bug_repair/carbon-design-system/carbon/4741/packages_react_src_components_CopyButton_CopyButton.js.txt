The issue described is related to the positioning of the copy button in the `CodeSnippet` component when in `single` mode. The problem arises because the `.bx--copy-btn` class is setting the `position` to `relative` instead of `absolute`. This is likely due to the import order of the CSS files, where the `copy-button` styles are overriding the `code-snippet` styles.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `code-snippet` styles are applied after the `copy-button` styles, so that the `position: absolute` style from the `code-snippet` is not overridden.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/CopyButton/CopyButton.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/code-snippet/code-snippet';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/copy-button/copy-button';
=======
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/copy-button/copy-button';
@import 'carbon-components/scss/components/code-snippet/code-snippet';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `code-snippet` styles are applied after the `copy-button` styles, thus preserving the `position: absolute` style for the copy button in `single` mode.
