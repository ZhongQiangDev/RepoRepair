The issue described involves missing tiles near the antimeridian when reprojecting GeoTiff tiles into a stereographic projection. This is likely due to how the tiles are being handled or rendered in the WebGLTileLayer. The provided code segment does not directly address the WebGLTileLayer or the GeoTIFF source, but it does handle tile representation in WebGL. 

To address the issue, we need to ensure that the tiles are correctly handled and rendered, especially near the antimeridian. This might involve adjusting how the tiles are loaded, rendered, or how the stereographic projection is applied.

However, the provided code segment does not directly relate to the issue. Therefore, we need to focus on the WebGLTileLayer and GeoTIFF source handling. Since the code segment provided is not directly related to the issue, no direct SEARCH/REPLACE edits can be made to this segment.

Instead, we should consider the following steps to address the issue:

1. Ensure that the GeoTIFF tiles are correctly reprojected into the stereographic projection.
2. Check if there are any specific settings or configurations in the WebGLTileLayer that need to be adjusted for stereographic projections.
3. Verify if there are any known issues or limitations with the stereographic projection in OpenLayers that might cause missing tiles near the antimeridian.

Since the provided code segment does not directly relate to the issue, no SEARCH/REPLACE edits are applicable here. The focus should be on the WebGLTileLayer and GeoTIFF source handling, which are not covered in the provided code segment.
