The issue described is related to the stacking of layer opacities in OpenLayers (OL) versions 6.8.1 and above, where layers with identical opacity values do not render correctly. The problem seems to be in how the opacity is being applied and combined for layers with the same opacity value.

To address this, we need to ensure that the opacity values are handled correctly when layers are rendered. The issue might be related to how the opacity is being rounded or applied in the `getLayerState` method.

Here's a potential fix:

```typescript
### src/ol/layer/Base.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    state.opacity = clamp(Math.round(this.getOpacity() * 100) / 100, 0, 1);
=======
    state.opacity = this.getOpacity();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the rounding of the opacity value, which might be causing the issue when multiple layers have the same opacity value. By directly using the opacity value without rounding, we ensure that the opacity is applied correctly for each layer.

If this change does not resolve the issue, further investigation into the rendering process and how opacity is combined for layers might be necessary. However, this is a good starting point to address the described behavior.
