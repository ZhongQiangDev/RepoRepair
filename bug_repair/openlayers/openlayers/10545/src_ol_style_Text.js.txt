The issue described is that character codes (like `&apos;`) are appearing in labels instead of being decoded to their proper characters (like `'`). This suggests that the text content is not being properly decoded before being used in the label.

To fix this, we need to decode the text content using `decodeURIComponent()` when setting the text in the `Text` class. We can do this by modifying the `setText` method to decode the text before storing it.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```typescript
### src/ol/style/Text.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Set the text.
   *
   * @param {string|undefined} text Text.
   * @api
   */
  setText(text) {
    this.text_ = text;
  }
=======
  /**
   * Set the text.
   *
   * @param {string|undefined} text Text.
   * @api
   */
  setText(text) {
    this.text_ = text ? decodeURIComponent(text) : text;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that any encoded characters in the text are properly decoded before being used in the label.
