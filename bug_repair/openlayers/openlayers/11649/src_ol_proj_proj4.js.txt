The issue described is related to the incorrect handling of geographic projections when using `proj4js` definitions with `OpenLayers`. Specifically, the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties are not being set correctly when creating the `Projection` object in `ol.proj.proj4.register`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `units` property is set to `'degrees'` for geographic projections when it is not defined in the `proj4js` definition. Additionally, we should set the `axisOrientation` property to `'neu'` for geographic projections when it is not defined.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/proj4.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      addProjection(
        new Projection({
          code: code,
          axisOrientation: def.axis,
          metersPerUnit: def.to_meter,
          units: def.units,
        })
      );
=======
      const units = def.units || 'degrees';
      const axisOrientation = def.axis || 'neu';
      addProjection(
        new Projection({
          code: code,
          axisOrientation: axisOrientation,
          metersPerUnit: def.to_meter,
          units: units,
        })
      );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `units` property is set to `'degrees'` and the `axisOrientation` property is set to `'neu'` when they are not defined in the `proj4js` definition. This should resolve the issue with broken projections when using geographic CRS.
