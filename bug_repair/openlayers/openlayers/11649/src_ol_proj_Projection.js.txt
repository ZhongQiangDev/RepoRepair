The issue described is related to the incorrect handling of geographic projections when using `proj4js` definitions with OpenLayers. Specifically, the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties are not being set correctly, leading to broken projections.

To address this, we need to ensure that when a geographic projection is defined using `proj4js`, the `units` are set to `'degrees'` by default, and the `axisOrientation` is set correctly based on the projection's characteristics.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/Projection.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    this.units_ = /** @type {import("./Units.js").default} */ (options.units);
=======
    this.units_ = options.units || 'degrees';
    if (this.units_ === 'degrees') {
      this.axisOrientation_ = 'neu';
    } else {
      this.axisOrientation_ = options.axisOrientation !== undefined ? options.axisOrientation : 'enu';
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if `units` is not provided in the options, it defaults to `'degrees'`, which is appropriate for geographic projections. Additionally, it sets the `axisOrientation` to `'neu'` when the units are `'degrees'`, which is the correct orientation for geographic coordinates.
