The issue described is related to the `GeometryCollection` not being handled correctly when modifying geometries. The problem seems to be in the `writeGeometryCollectionGeometry_` method, where the geometries within the `GeometryCollection` are not being processed correctly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that each geometry within the `GeometryCollection` is properly added to the RTree and that the segments are correctly updated when modifying the geometry.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/interaction/Modify.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * @param {Feature} feature Feature
   * @param {import("../geom/GeometryCollection.js").default} geometry Geometry.
   * @private
   */
  writeGeometryCollectionGeometry_(feature, geometry) {
    const geometries = geometry.getGeometriesArray();
    for (let i = 0; i < geometries.length; ++i) {
      const geometry = geometries[i];
      const writer = this.SEGMENT_WRITERS_[geometry.getType()];
      writer(feature, geometry);
    }
  }
=======
  /**
   * @param {Feature} feature Feature
   * @param {import("../geom/GeometryCollection.js").default} geometry Geometry.
   * @private
   */
  writeGeometryCollectionGeometry_(feature, geometry) {
    const geometries = geometry.getGeometriesArray();
    for (let i = 0; i < geometries.length; ++i) {
      const subGeometry = geometries[i];
      const writer = this.SEGMENT_WRITERS_[subGeometry.getType()];
      if (writer) {
        writer(feature, subGeometry);
      }
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that each geometry within the `GeometryCollection` is processed correctly by the appropriate writer function. This should resolve the issue where the interaction does not work correctly when editing a `GeometryCollection`.
