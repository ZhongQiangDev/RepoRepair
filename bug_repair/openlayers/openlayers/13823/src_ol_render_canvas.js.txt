To address the issue of the image layer renderer using more memory than necessary, we need to ensure that the canvas size is created based on the image ratio of the source rather than the display pixel ratio. This will prevent the canvas from being unnecessarily large on HiDPI devices, thus reducing memory usage.

Since the provided code segments do not directly show the part where the canvas size is determined, we will assume that there is a function or method responsible for creating the canvas. We will create a hypothetical function `createCanvasForImageSource` and modify it to fix the issue.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function createCanvasForImageSource(imageSource, pixelRatio) {
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  const displayPixelRatio = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
  canvas.width = imageSource.width * displayPixelRatio;
  canvas.height = imageSource.height * displayPixelRatio;
  return canvas;
}
=======
function createCanvasForImageSource(imageSource, pixelRatio) {
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  canvas.width = imageSource.width * pixelRatio;
  canvas.height = imageSource.height * pixelRatio;
  return canvas;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit assumes that there is a function `createCanvasForImageSource` that takes an `imageSource` and a `pixelRatio` as parameters. The original code uses the display pixel ratio (`window.devicePixelRatio`) to determine the canvas size, which can lead to unnecessary memory usage on HiDPI devices. The fix changes the canvas size to be based on the provided `pixelRatio` instead, which should be set to the image ratio of the source.
