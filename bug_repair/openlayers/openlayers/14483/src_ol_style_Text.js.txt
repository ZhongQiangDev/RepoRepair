The issue described is related to the incorrect rendering of rotated text styles when the context is clipped and translated. The problem seems to be in how the rotation is applied relative to the translation. The rotation should be applied after the translation to ensure the text is correctly positioned.

To fix this, we need to adjust the rendering logic for rotated text styles. This likely involves modifying the rendering code that handles the translation and rotation of text styles.

Since the provided code segment is from `src/ol/style/Text.js`, which defines the `Text` class for styling text, the actual rendering logic is probably in a different part of the OpenLayers codebase. However, we can still make a hypothetical edit to illustrate the concept.

Here's a hypothetical edit that might address the issue:

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/Text.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
context.translate(x, y);
context.rotate(rotation);
=======
context.save();
context.translate(x, y);
context.rotate(rotation);
context.translate(-x, -y);
context.translate(x, y);
context.restore();
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical edit assumes that the rendering code is in `src/ol/render/canvas/Text.js` and that it involves a `context.translate` and `context.rotate` call. The edit ensures that the rotation is applied relative to the translated position by saving the context, applying the translation, rotation, and then restoring the context.

However, since the actual rendering code is not provided, this is a conceptual fix. The actual fix would need to be applied to the correct rendering code in the OpenLayers library.
