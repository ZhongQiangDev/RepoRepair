The issue described is related to the WebGLTile layer rendering error images outside the original extent. This seems to be caused by the extent not being properly set or respected when rendering the tiles. The provided code segments do not directly address the WebGLTile layer, but they do provide some context on how tile sources are managed.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the extent is correctly set and respected when rendering the tiles. Here's a potential fix:

```typescript
### src/components/test2.vue
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const layer = new WebGLTile({
  className: "WebGLTile",
  style,
  source,
  extent: view.extent,
});
=======
const layer = new WebGLTile({
  className: "WebGLTile",
  style,
  source,
  extent: view.extent,
  // Ensure the extent is respected by setting the tileGrid extent
  tileGrid: new TileGrid({
    extent: view.extent,
    tileSize: [256, 256],
    resolutions: resolutions, // Ensure you have the correct resolutions array
  }),
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `tileGrid` is explicitly set with the correct extent, which should help in rendering the tiles within the specified extent. Additionally, make sure that the `resolutions` array is correctly defined and passed to the `TileGrid` constructor.

If the issue persists, you may also want to check the `GeoTIFFSource` configuration and ensure that it respects the extent as well. Here's an additional potential fix for the `GeoTIFFSource`:

```typescript
### src/components/test2.vue
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const source = new GeoTIFFSource({
  normalize: false,
  sources: [
    {
      url: "http://10.17.17.31:8082/lake_product_static/testbigtif/cog.tif",
    },
  ],
});
=======
const source = new GeoTIFFSource({
  normalize: false,
  sources: [
    {
      url: "http://10.17.17.31:8082/lake_product_static/testbigtif/cog.tif",
      extent: view.extent, // Set the extent for the GeoTIFF source
    },
  ],
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should help in ensuring that the WebGLTile layer respects the specified extent and does not render error images outside the original extent.
