The issue described is related to the `ol.select.Interaction` feature always being shown as the top layer, regardless of the `zIndex` setting. This behavior is due to how OpenLayers handles the rendering of selected features. The selected features are rendered in a separate layer that is managed by the `ol.select.Interaction` and is always rendered on top of other layers.

To address this issue, you can modify the `ol.select.Interaction` to allow customization of the rendering order. However, since the `ol.select.Interaction` is part of the OpenLayers library, you cannot directly modify its behavior through the `BaseLayer` class.

Instead, you can create a custom `ol.select.Interaction` that allows you to control the rendering order of the selected features. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a custom `ol.select.Interaction` that extends the original `ol.select.Interaction`.
2. Override the `handleEvent` method to customize the rendering order of the selected features.

Here's an example of how you can create a custom `ol.select.Interaction`:

```typescript
### src/ol/interaction/Select.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import Select from 'ol/interaction/Select.js';
=======
import Select from 'ol/interaction/Select.js';

class CustomSelect extends Select {
  constructor(options) {
    super(options);
  }

  handleEvent(mapBrowserEvent) {
    const result = super.handleEvent(mapBrowserEvent);
    if (result) {
      // Customize the rendering order of the selected features
      const selectedFeatures = this.getFeatures();
      selectedFeatures.forEach(feature => {
        // Set the zIndex of the selected feature to a lower value
        feature.setStyle(new Style({
          zIndex: 0
        }));
      });
    }
    return result;
  }
}

export default CustomSelect;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Then, you can use the `CustomSelect` interaction in your code instead of the original `ol.select.Interaction`:

```typescript
import CustomSelect from 'ol/interaction/CustomSelect.js';

const selectInteraction = new CustomSelect({
  // Your options here
});

map.addInteraction(selectInteraction);
```

This will allow you to control the rendering order of the selected features and achieve the desired behavior.
