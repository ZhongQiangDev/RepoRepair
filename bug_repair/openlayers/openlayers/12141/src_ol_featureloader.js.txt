The issue described is that the `VectorSource.getExtent()` returns `[Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]`, which is incorrect. This happens because the `success` callback is called before the features are added to the source. To fix this, we need to ensure that the features are added to the source before the `success` callback is called.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/ol/featureloader.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function (features, dataProjection) {
  if (success !== undefined) {
    success(features);
  }
  source.addFeatures(features);
=======
function (features, dataProjection) {
  source.addFeatures(features);
  if (success !== undefined) {
    success(features);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit ensures that the features are added to the source before the `success` callback is called, which should resolve the issue with the extent calculation.
