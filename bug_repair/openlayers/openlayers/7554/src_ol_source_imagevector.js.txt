The issue described is related to the performance degradation of the draw interaction when upgrading from OpenLayers 4.4.2 to 4.6.2, specifically when using `renderMode: 'image'`. The `ol.source.ImageVector` has been deprecated in favor of using `ol.layer.Vector` with `renderMode: 'image'` and `ol.source.Vector`.

To address this, the code should be updated to use the recommended approach. However, since the provided code is for the deprecated `ol.source.ImageVector`, the fix involves changing the layer configuration in the application code rather than modifying the `ol.source.ImageVector` source code.

Here's how you can update the application code to use the recommended approach:

```javascript
### src/app.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
var vectorSource = new ol.source.ImageVector({
  source: new ol.source.Vector({
    // vector source options
  })
});
var vectorLayer = new ol.layer.Image({
  source: vectorSource
});
=======
var vectorSource = new ol.source.Vector({
  // vector source options
});
var vectorLayer = new ol.layer.Vector({
  source: vectorSource,
  renderMode: 'image'
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the application uses the non-deprecated approach, which should resolve the performance issues observed with the deprecated `ol.source.ImageVector`.
