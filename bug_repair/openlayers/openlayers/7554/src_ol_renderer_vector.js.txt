The issue described is related to the performance degradation of the draw interaction when upgrading from OpenLayers 4.4.2 to 4.6.2, specifically when using `renderMode: 'image'`. The problem seems to be related to the deprecation of `ol.source.ImageVector` in OpenLayers 4.6.0.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the rendering process is optimized for the new version. The provided code snippet does not directly relate to the issue, but we can infer that the problem might be in how the `renderMode: 'image'` is handled in the new version.

Here is a potential fix that involves adjusting the rendering process to improve performance:

```javascript
### src/ol/renderer/vector.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * @param {ol.render.ReplayGroup} replayGroup Replay group.
 * @param {ol.geom.Geometry} geometry Geometry.
 * @param {ol.style.Style} style Style.
 * @param {ol.Feature|ol.render.Feature} feature Feature.
 * @private
 */
=======
/**
 * @param {ol.render.ReplayGroup} replayGroup Replay group.
 * @param {ol.geom.Geometry} geometry Geometry.
 * @param {ol.style.Style} style Style.
 * @param {ol.Feature|ol.render.Feature} feature Feature.
 * @private
 */
ol.renderer.vector.renderGeometry_ = function(replayGroup, geometry, style, feature) {
  if (replayGroup.renderMode === 'image') {
    // Optimize rendering for image mode
    replayGroup.setImageRenderMode(true);
  }
  // Existing rendering logic
  // ...
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit introduces a check for the `renderMode` and sets an appropriate rendering mode for the `replayGroup` when it is set to 'image'. This should help in optimizing the rendering process and improving the performance of the draw interaction.

Please note that this is a hypothetical solution based on the provided information. The actual implementation might require further investigation and testing to ensure that it resolves the performance issue effectively.
