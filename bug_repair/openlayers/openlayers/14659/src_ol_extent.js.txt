Based on the issue statement, the problem seems to be related to the extent comparison logic within the `drawFeature` method. The issue mentions that the extent comparison is redundant and could be removed, and that the comparison in `drawCircle` needs fixing. However, the provided code segment does not include the `drawFeature` or `drawCircle` methods. Therefore, we need to focus on the extent comparison logic that might be causing the issue.

The `containsExtent` function seems to be a potential candidate for the extent comparison logic that might be causing the issue. Let's assume that the `drawFeature` method uses this function to check if the feature is within the view extent. If the feature is not within the view extent, it might not be drawn correctly.

To fix the issue, we can modify the `containsExtent` function to be more lenient in its comparison. Instead of checking if the feature extent is completely within the view extent, we can check if the feature extent intersects with the view extent. This way, the feature will be drawn even if it is partially outside the view extent.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/ol/extent.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function containsExtent(extent1, extent2) {
  return (
    extent1[0] <= extent2[0] &&
    extent2[2] <= extent1[2] &&
    extent1[1] <= extent2[1] &&
    extent2[3] <= extent1[3]
  );
}
=======
export function containsExtent(extent1, extent2) {
  return intersects(extent1, extent2);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit replaces the `containsExtent` function with a call to the `intersects` function, which checks if the two extents intersect. This should allow the feature to be drawn even if it is partially outside the view extent.
