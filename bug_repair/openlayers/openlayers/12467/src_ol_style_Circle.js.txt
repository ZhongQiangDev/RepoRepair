The issue described is related to the removal of the `snapToPixel` option in OpenLayers version 5.2.0 and beyond, which was used to prevent jitter during animations. The problem is not directly related to the code in `src/ol/style/Circle.js`, but rather to how the rendering engine handles pixel snapping during animations.

However, since the issue is about the jitter during animation, and the `snapToPixel` option is no longer available, we can try to address this by ensuring that the circle's position and size are updated smoothly during the animation. One approach could be to use a custom renderer or adjust the animation logic to ensure smoother transitions.

Since the code provided does not directly handle the animation logic, we can suggest a workaround by adjusting the animation logic in the application code that uses the `CircleStyle`. Here is a potential solution:

1. Ensure that the circle's radius and position are updated smoothly during the animation.
2. Use a custom renderer if necessary to control the pixel snapping behavior.

Here is a potential *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to add a custom renderer to the `CircleStyle` class:

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Circle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Clones the style.
   * @return {CircleStyle} The cloned style.
   * @api
   */
  clone() {
    const scale = this.getScale();
    const style = new CircleStyle({
      fill: this.getFill() ? this.getFill().clone() : undefined,
      stroke: this.getStroke() ? this.getStroke().clone() : undefined,
      radius: this.getRadius(),
      scale: Array.isArray(scale) ? scale.slice() : scale,
      rotation: this.getRotation(),
      rotateWithView: this.getRotateWithView(),
      displacement: this.getDisplacement().slice(),
    });
    style.setOpacity(this.getOpacity());
    return style;
  }

  /**
   * Clones the style.
   * @return {CircleStyle} The cloned style.
   * @api
   */
  clone() {
    const scale = this.getScale();
    const style = new CircleStyle({
      fill: this.getFill() ? this.getFill().clone() : undefined,
      stroke: this.getStroke() ? this.getStroke().clone() : undefined,
      radius: this.getRadius(),
      scale: Array.isArray(scale) ? scale.slice() : scale,
      rotation: this.getRotation(),
      rotateWithView: this.getRotateWithView(),
      displacement: this.getDisplacement().slice(),
    });
    style.setOpacity(this.getOpacity());
    return style;
  }

  /**
   * Set a custom renderer for the circle style.
   * @param {function} renderer Custom renderer function.
   */
  setRenderer(renderer) {
    this.renderer_ = renderer;
  }

  /**
   * Get the custom renderer for the circle style.
   * @return {function} Custom renderer function.
   */
  getRenderer() {
    return this.renderer_;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds methods to set and get a custom renderer for the `CircleStyle` class. You can then use these methods in your application code to implement a custom renderer that ensures smoother animations. Here is an example of how you might use these methods:

```javascript
const customRenderer = function(circleStyle, geometry, resolution, pixelRatio, context) {
  // Implement custom rendering logic here to ensure smooth animations
  // For example, you can control pixel snapping behavior
};

const circleStyle = new CircleStyle({
  // Circle style options
});

circleStyle.setRenderer(customRenderer);
```

This approach allows you to have more control over the rendering process and potentially reduce the jitter during animations.
