The issue described is not directly related to the `TileGrid.js` file but rather to the `TileLayer.js` file in the `openlayers` repository. However, based on the issue description, the problem is with the incorrect use of `layer.getMinZoom()` in the context of tile grid zoom levels. The fix involves replacing the use of `layer.getMinZoom()` with a calculation that properly maps the view zoom level to the tile grid zoom level.

Since the issue is in `TileLayer.js`, and the provided code is from `TileGrid.js`, we need to focus on the `TileLayer.js` file. However, I can still provide a hypothetical fix based on the issue description.

```javascript
### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const minZoom = layer.getMinZoom();
=======
const minZoom = tileGrid.getZForResolution(view.getResolutionForZoom(layer.getMinZoom()));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix assumes that the `TileLayer.js` file contains a line similar to `const minZoom = layer.getMinZoom();` and replaces it with a calculation that properly maps the view zoom level to the tile grid zoom level using `tileGrid.getZForResolution(view.getResolutionForZoom(layer.getMinZoom()))`.

If you have the actual code from `TileLayer.js`, you can apply this fix directly. If not, you can use this as a guide to locate and fix the issue in the correct file.
