The issue described is related to the raster reprojection behavior in OpenLayers, specifically how it handles the alignment of pixels when projecting from one coordinate system to another. The problem is not directly related to the `Projection` class in the provided code, but rather to the raster reprojection logic which is not shown in the provided code segments.

However, based on the issue description, the problem seems to be related to the assumption that projected pixels should be square, which leads to misalignment when the source pixels cover non-square areas in the target projection.

To address this issue, we would need to modify the raster reprojection logic to preserve the number of source pixels in the projection result. This would likely involve changes to the reprojection algorithm rather than the `Projection` class.

Since the provided code does not include the raster reprojection logic, we cannot provide a direct SEARCH/REPLACE edit for the issue. However, if the reprojection logic is implemented in a function like `reprojectRaster`, a potential fix might look like this:

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj/reprojectRaster.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function reprojectRaster(source, target, options) {
  // Existing reprojection logic that assumes square pixels
  // ...
=======
function reprojectRaster(source, target, options) {
  // Modified reprojection logic that preserves the number of source pixels
  // Calculate the correct pixel dimensions in the target projection
  const sourcePixelSize = calculatePixelSize(source);
  const targetPixelSize = calculatePixelSize(target);
  
  // Adjust the reprojection to preserve the number of source pixels
  // ...
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this hypothetical fix, `calculatePixelSize` would be a function that calculates the size of a pixel in the source and target projections, and the reprojection logic would be adjusted to preserve the number of source pixels in the result.

To implement this fix, you would need to locate the actual reprojection logic in your codebase and modify it accordingly. If you can provide the relevant code segments for the reprojection logic, I can provide a more specific SEARCH/REPLACE edit.
