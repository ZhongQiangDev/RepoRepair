The issue described is related to the alignment, placement, and size of point symbols when displaying a KML layer in OpenLayers. The symbols appear to be anchored at the center-bottom instead of the center, and they are larger than expected compared to how they are displayed in Google Earth.

To address this, we need to adjust the anchor point and size of the icons used for point symbols. Specifically, we should ensure that the anchor point is set correctly and that the size is scaled appropriately.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/format/KML.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const imageStyle = new Icon({
      anchor: anchor,
      anchorOrigin: anchorOrigin,
      anchorXUnits: anchorXUnits,
      anchorYUnits: anchorYUnits,
      crossOrigin: this.crossOrigin_,
      offset: offset,
      offsetOrigin: IconOrigin.BOTTOM_LEFT,
      rotation: rotation,
      scale: scale,
      size: size,
      src: this.iconUrlFunction_(src),
      color: color,
    });
=======
    const imageStyle = new Icon({
      anchor: anchor ? anchor : [0.5, 0.5], // Set default anchor to center
      anchorOrigin: anchorOrigin ? anchorOrigin : IconOrigin.CENTER, // Set default anchor origin to center
      anchorXUnits: anchorXUnits ? anchorXUnits : IconAnchorUnits.FRACTION, // Set default anchor units to fraction
      anchorYUnits: anchorYUnits ? anchorYUnits : IconAnchorUnits.FRACTION, // Set default anchor units to fraction
      crossOrigin: this.crossOrigin_,
      offset: offset,
      offsetOrigin: IconOrigin.CENTER, // Set default offset origin to center
      rotation: rotation,
      scale: scale ? scale : 1, // Set default scale to 1 if not provided
      size: size ? size : [32, 32], // Set default size to 32x32 if not provided
      src: this.iconUrlFunction_(src),
      color: color,
    });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if no specific anchor point, anchor units, or size are provided in the KML file, the default values will be set to center the icon and use a reasonable size. This should help align the symbols correctly and adjust their size to match the expected appearance in Google Earth.
