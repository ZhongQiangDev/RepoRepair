The issue described is related to the incorrect alignment and size of point symbols when displaying a KML layer in OpenLayers. The problem seems to be with the anchor point and scaling of the icons. The anchor point is set at the center-bottom instead of the center, and the icons appear larger than expected.

To address this, we need to ensure that the anchor point is correctly set to the center of the icon and adjust the scaling if necessary. The `Icon` class in `src/ol/style/Icon.js` is responsible for handling these properties.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Icon.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * @private
     * @type {Array<number>}
     */
    this.anchor_ = options.anchor !== undefined ? options.anchor : [0.5, 0.5];
=======
    /**
     * @private
     * @type {Array<number>}
     */
    this.anchor_ = options.anchor !== undefined ? options.anchor : [0.5, 0.5]; // Center alignment

    // Adjust the size of the icon if necessary
    if (options.size) {
      this.size_ = options.size;
    } else {
      const imgSize = this.iconImage_.getSize();
      if (imgSize) {
        this.size_ = [imgSize[0] * 0.5, imgSize[1] * 0.5]; // Reduce size by 50%
      }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the anchor point is set to the center of the icon by default. Additionally, it adjusts the size of the icon if necessary, reducing it by 50% if no explicit size is provided. This should help in aligning the icons correctly and adjusting their size to match the expected appearance.
