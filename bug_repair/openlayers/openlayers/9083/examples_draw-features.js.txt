The issue described is related to the inability to drag the map after drawing a polygon in OpenLayers 5.3.0, which does not occur in version 4.6.5. The problem seems to be related to the `altKeyOnly` condition used in the draw interaction.

To address this, we can modify the draw interaction to use a different condition or remove the condition altogether to see if it resolves the issue. Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###examples/draw-features.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const draw = new Draw({
  source: source,
  type: typeSelect.value,
  condition: ol.events.condition.altKeyOnly,
});
=======
const draw = new Draw({
  source: source,
  type: typeSelect.value,
  // Remove the condition to see if it resolves the issue
  // condition: ol.events.condition.altKeyOnly,
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the `altKeyOnly` condition from the draw interaction. If this resolves the issue, you can then experiment with different conditions or configurations to find a suitable solution that meets your requirements.
