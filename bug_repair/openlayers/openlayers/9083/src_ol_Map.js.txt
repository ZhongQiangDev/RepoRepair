The issue described in the video and the issue text is related to a problem with dragging the map after drawing a polygon in OpenLayers 5.3.0. The user has already identified that rolling back to OpenLayers 4.6.5 resolves the issue. However, if we want to fix this issue within the current version of OpenLayers, we need to ensure that the map interactions are properly managed.

The problem seems to be related to the interaction condition `ol.events.condition.altKeyOnly`. This condition might be interfering with the map's dragging functionality. One possible solution is to modify the interaction condition to allow dragging the map even when the alt key is pressed.

Here is a potential fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/Map.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
condition: ol.events.condition.altKeyOnly,
=======
condition: function(event) {
  return ol.events.condition.altKeyOnly(event) || ol.events.condition.noModifierKeys(event);
},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will allow the map to be dragged even when the alt key is pressed, which should resolve the issue. If this does not resolve the issue, further investigation into the interaction conditions and event handling in OpenLayers 5.3.0 may be necessary.
