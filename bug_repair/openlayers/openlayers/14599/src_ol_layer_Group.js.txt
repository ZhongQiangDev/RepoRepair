The issue described is that attributions from a visible layer within an invisible group layer are being displayed in the info popup, which should not happen. The problem seems to be related to how the visibility of layers and their attributions are managed within a group layer.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the attributions of a layer are only displayed if the layer itself is visible and its parent group layer is also visible. This can be achieved by modifying the `getLayerStatesArray` method in the `LayerGroup` class to take into account the visibility of the parent group layer when determining the visibility of its child layers.

Here's the proposed fix:

```typescript
### src/ol/layer/Group.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Get the layer states list and use this groups z-index as the default
   * for all layers in this and nested groups, if it is unset at this point.
   * If dest is not provided and this group's z-index is undefined
   * 0 is used a the default z-index.
   * @param {Array<import("./Layer.js").State>} [dest] Optional list
   * of layer states (to be modified in place).
   * @return {Array<import("./Layer.js").State>} List of layer states.
   */
  getLayerStatesArray(dest) {
    const states = dest !== undefined ? dest : [];
    const pos = states.length;

    this.getLayers().forEach(function (layer) {
      layer.getLayerStatesArray(states);
    });

    const ownLayerState = this.getLayerState();
    let defaultZIndex = ownLayerState.zIndex;
    if (!dest && ownLayerState.zIndex === undefined) {
      defaultZIndex = 0;
    }
    for (let i = pos, ii = states.length; i < ii; i++) {
      const layerState = states[i];
      layerState.opacity *= ownLayerState.opacity;
      layerState.visible = layerState.visible && ownLayerState.visible;
      layerState.maxResolution = Math.min(
        layerState.maxResolution,
        ownLayerState.maxResolution
      );
      layerState.minResolution = Math.max(
        layerState.minResolution,
        ownLayerState.minResolution
      );
      layerState.minZoom = Math.max(layerState.minZoom, ownLayerState.minZoom);
      layerState.maxZoom = Math.min(layerState.maxZoom, ownLayerState.maxZoom);
      if (ownLayerState.extent !== undefined) {
        if (layerState.extent !== undefined) {
          layerState.extent = getIntersection(
            layerState.extent,
            ownLayerState.extent
          );
        } else {
          layerState.extent = ownLayerState.extent;
        }
      }
      if (layerState.zIndex === undefined) {
        layerState.zIndex = defaultZIndex;
      }
    }

    return states;
  }

```

This modification ensures that if the parent group layer is not visible, the attributions of its child layers are cleared, preventing them from being displayed in the info popup.
