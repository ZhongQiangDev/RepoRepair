The issue described is related to the performance of the `pointermove` event in version 6.4.0 compared to 6.3.1, particularly when dealing with a large number of features and non-cached styles. The performance degradation affects operations like zooming and panning. The provided code segments are from the `MapBrowserEventHandler` class, which handles pointer events.

The performance issue might be related to how the `pointermove` event is handled and relayed. Specifically, the `relayEvent_` method might be causing unnecessary computations or event dispatching that could be optimized.

Here's a potential fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Wrap and relay a pointer event.  Note that this requires that the type
   * string for the MapBrowserEvent matches the PointerEvent type.
   * @param {PointerEvent} pointerEvent Pointer
   * event.
   * @private
   */
  relayEvent_(pointerEvent) {
    this.originalPointerMoveEvent_ = pointerEvent;
    const dragging = !!(this.down_ && this.isMoving_(pointerEvent));
    this.dispatchEvent(
      new MapBrowserEvent(pointerEvent.type, this.map_, pointerEvent, dragging)
    );
  }
=======
  /**
   * Wrap and relay a pointer event.  Note that this requires that the type
   * string for the MapBrowserEvent matches the PointerEvent type.
   * @param {PointerEvent} pointerEvent Pointer
   * event.
   * @private
   */
  relayEvent_(pointerEvent) {
    if (this.isMoving_(pointerEvent)) {
      this.originalPointerMoveEvent_ = pointerEvent;
      const dragging = !!(this.down_ && this.isMoving_(pointerEvent));
      this.dispatchEvent(
        new MapBrowserEvent(pointerEvent.type, this.map_, pointerEvent, dragging)
      );
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `pointermove` event is only relayed and dispatched if the pointer has moved a significant distance, as determined by the `isMoving_` method. This should help reduce unnecessary computations and improve performance, especially when dealing with a large number of features.
