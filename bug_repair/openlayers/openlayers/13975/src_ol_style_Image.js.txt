The issue described in the text is related to the behavior of `ol.style.Icon` when modifying the `scale` and `displacement` options. The user expects the bottom of the icons to remain at the same Y position regardless of the scale, but this is not happening. This suggests that there might be a dependency between `scale` and `displacement` that is not being handled correctly.

However, the provided code segment is from `src/ol/style/Image.js`, which is a base class for `ol.style.Icon`. The actual implementation of `ol.style.Icon` is not provided, so we cannot directly modify the code to fix the issue. Instead, we can suggest a potential fix by modifying the `ol.style.Icon` class if we had access to it.

Since we don't have the `ol.style.Icon` class code, we can only suggest a conceptual fix. If we assume that the `ol.style.Icon` class has a method to calculate the position of the icon based on `scale` and `displacement`, we can suggest modifying that method to account for the scale when calculating the displacement.

Here is a conceptual fix assuming we had access to the `ol.style.Icon` class:

```typescript
### src/ol/style/Icon.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Calculate the position of the icon based on scale and displacement.
   * @param {number} scale Scale.
   * @param {Array<number>} displacement Displacement.
   * @return {Array<number>} Position.
   */
  calculatePosition(scale, displacement) {
    return [displacement[0], displacement[1]];
  }
=======
  /**
   * Calculate the position of the icon based on scale and displacement.
   * @param {number} scale Scale.
   * @param {Array<number>} displacement Displacement.
   * @return {Array<number>} Position.
   */
  calculatePosition(scale, displacement) {
    const scaledDisplacement = [
      displacement[0] * scale,
      displacement[1] * scale
    ];
    return scaledDisplacement;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This conceptual fix suggests that the `calculatePosition` method should take into account the scale when calculating the displacement. This would ensure that the bottom of the icons remains at the same Y position regardless of the scale.

Since we don't have the actual `ol.style.Icon` class code, this is just a suggestion. The actual fix would depend on the specific implementation of the `ol.style.Icon` class.
