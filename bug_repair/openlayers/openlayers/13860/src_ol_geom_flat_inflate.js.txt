The issue seems to be related to the `inflateMultiCoordinatesArray` function in the `src/ol/geom/flat/inflate.js` file. The error "Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length" suggests that there is an issue with the array lengths being manipulated within this function. Specifically, the problem might be in the way the `coordinatesss` array is being populated and resized.

The issue appears to be in the line where `coordinatesss[i]` is being used as the fourth argument in the `inflateCoordinatesArray` function call. This argument is supposed to be an optional array to reuse, but it is being passed as `coordinatesss[i]` which might not be initialized properly.

To fix this, we should ensure that `coordinatesss[i]` is properly initialized before being passed to `inflateCoordinatesArray`. Here's the proposed fix:

```typescript
### src/ol/geom/flat/inflate.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    coordinatesss[i++] = inflateCoordinatesArray(
      flatCoordinates,
      offset,
      ends,
      stride,
      coordinatesss[i]
    );
=======
    coordinatesss[i] = coordinatesss[i] || [];
    coordinatesss[i] = inflateCoordinatesArray(
      flatCoordinates,
      offset,
      ends,
      stride,
      coordinatesss[i]
    );
    i++;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `coordinatesss[i]` is initialized as an empty array if it is not already defined before being passed to `inflateCoordinatesArray`. This should prevent the "Invalid array length" error.
