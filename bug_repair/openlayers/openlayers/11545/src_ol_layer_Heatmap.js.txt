The issue is that the `className` setting in `ol.layer.Heatmap` is not being applied correctly. The `className` property is not being passed to the `VectorLayer` constructor, which is the base class for `Heatmap`. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `className` is included in the `baseOptions` object that is passed to the `VectorLayer` constructor.

Here is the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const baseOptions = assign({}, options);

    delete baseOptions.gradient;
    delete baseOptions.radius;
    delete baseOptions.blur;
    delete baseOptions.weight;
=======
    const baseOptions = assign({}, options);

    // Ensure className is included in baseOptions
    if (options.className) {
        baseOptions.className = options.className;
    }

    delete baseOptions.gradient;
    delete baseOptions.radius;
    delete baseOptions.blur;
    delete baseOptions.weight;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `className` property is included in the `baseOptions` object, which is then passed to the `VectorLayer` constructor. This should resolve the issue where the custom `className` is not being applied to the heatmap layer.
