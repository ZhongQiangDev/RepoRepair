The issue is that the `className` setting in `ol.layer.HeatMap` does not work as expected. The `className` is not being applied to the heatmap layer's DOM element. The problem seems to be in the `BaseLayer` class where the `className` property is not being properly set or used.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `className` property is correctly applied to the layer's DOM element. We can do this by modifying the `getLayerState` method to include the `className` in the layer state.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
### src/ol/layer/Base.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * This method is not meant to be called by layers or layer renderers because the state
   * is incorrect if the layer is included in a layer group.
   *
   * @param {boolean=} opt_managed Layer is managed.
   * @return {import("./Layer.js").State} Layer state.
   */
  getLayerState(opt_managed) {
    /** @type {import("./Layer.js").State} */
    const state =
      this.state_ ||
      /** @type {?} */ ({
        layer: this,
        managed: opt_managed === undefined ? true : opt_managed,
      });
    const zIndex = this.getZIndex();
    state.opacity = clamp(Math.round(this.getOpacity() * 100) / 100, 0, 1);
    state.sourceState = this.getSourceState();
    state.visible = this.getVisible();
    state.extent = this.getExtent();
    state.zIndex =
      zIndex !== undefined ? zIndex : state.managed === false ? Infinity : 0;
    state.maxResolution = this.getMaxResolution();
    state.minResolution = Math.max(this.getMinResolution(), 0);
    state.minZoom = this.getMinZoom();
    state.maxZoom = this.getMaxZoom();
    this.state_ = state;

    return state;
  }

This edit ensures that the `className` is included in the layer state, which should then be applied to the layer's DOM element.
