The issue described is related to white areas appearing on the map when zooming in and out, which is caused by tiles being disposed of and excluded from the stitching process during reprojection. The problem seems to be that tiles in the `ABORT` state are not being considered, leading to gaps in the map.

To fix this, we need to modify the loop that checks the state of the source tiles to include tiles in the `ABORT` state as well. This will ensure that these tiles are not prematurely disposed of and can be included in the reprojection process.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      this.sourceTiles_.forEach(function(tile, i, arr) {
        if (tile && tile.getState() == TileState.LOADED) {
          sources.push({
            extent: this.sourceTileGrid_.getTileCoordExtent(tile.tileCoord),
            image: tile.getImage()
          });
        }
      }.bind(this));
=======
      this.sourceTiles_.forEach(function(tile, i, arr) {
        if (tile && (tile.getState() == TileState.LOADED || tile.getState() == TileState.ABORT)) {
          sources.push({
            extent: this.sourceTileGrid_.getTileCoordExtent(tile.tileCoord),
            image: tile.getImage()
          });
        }
      }.bind(this));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that tiles in the `ABORT` state are also included in the `sources` array, which should help in reducing the white areas on the map. However, as mentioned in the issue, simply including `ABORT` state tiles might cause problems later on. Therefore, it might be necessary to further investigate why these tiles are being aborted and ensure that they are properly refetched or handled in a way that does not disrupt the reprojection process.
