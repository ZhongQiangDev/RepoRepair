The issue described is related to white areas appearing on the map when zooming in and out with a reprojected Tile layer. This is caused by tiles being disposed and excluded from the stitching process. The solution involves ensuring that tiles in the `ABORT` state are not disposed of or refetched appropriately.

However, the provided code segment does not directly address the `ABORT` state or the stitching process. The code is from the `TileSource` class, which is a base class for tile sources. The issue likely resides in the `ol.reproj.Tile` class or related re-projection logic, which is not included in the provided code.

To address the issue, we need to modify the logic that handles tile states during re-projection. Since the provided code does not include the relevant part, I will provide a hypothetical fix assuming the `ol.reproj.Tile` class has a method that handles tile states.

```typescript
### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for (let i = 0, ii = tiles.length; i < ii; ++i) {
  const tile = tiles[i];
  if (tile.getState() === TileState.LOADED) {
    // existing stitching logic
  }
}
=======
for (let i = 0, ii = tiles.length; i < ii; ++i) {
  const tile = tiles[i];
  if (tile.getState() === TileState.LOADED || tile.getState() === TileState.ABORT) {
    // modified stitching logic to include ABORT state tiles
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix assumes that the `ol.reproj.Tile` class has a loop that iterates over tiles and stitches them together. The fix includes tiles in the `ABORT` state in the stitching process.

If the actual code is different, you would need to locate the relevant part of the code that handles tile states during re-projection and modify it accordingly. The key is to ensure that tiles in the `ABORT` state are not excluded from the stitching process.
