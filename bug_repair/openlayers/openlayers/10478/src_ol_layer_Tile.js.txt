The issue described is related to the disposal of tiles in the reprojection process, which leads to white areas appearing on the map when zooming in and out. The provided code snippet is from the `TileLayer` class in the `ol/layer/Tile.js` file, but it does not directly address the reprojection process or tile disposal. The issue seems to be more related to the `ol.reproj.Tile` module, which is not included in the provided code.

However, based on the issue description, we can infer that the problem might be related to how tiles are managed during the reprojection process. The issue suggests that tiles in the `ABORT` state should not be disposed of or should be refetched.

Since the provided code does not include the relevant reprojection logic, we can only speculate on the potential fix. If we assume that the `ol.reproj.Tile` module has a loop that filters out tiles in the `ABORT` state, we might need to modify that loop to include these tiles.

Here is a hypothetical fix assuming the `ol.reproj.Tile` module has a loop that filters tiles:

```typescript
### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
for (let i = 0, ii = tiles.length; i < ii; ++i) {
  const tile = tiles[i];
  if (tile.getState() !== TileState.ABORT) {
    // Process tile
  }
}
=======
for (let i = 0, ii = tiles.length; i < ii; ++i) {
  const tile = tiles[i];
  if (tile.getState() !== TileState.LOST) {
    // Process tile
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix assumes that the `ABORT` state should be treated similarly to other states and not be excluded from the reprojection process. The actual fix would depend on the specific implementation details of the `ol.reproj.Tile` module, which are not provided in the given code snippet.
