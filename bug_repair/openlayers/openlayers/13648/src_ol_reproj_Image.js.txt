The issue described is related to the display of a COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) where only the upper part is shown, while the expected behavior is to display the entire image as seen in QGIS or geotiff.io. The problem seems to be related to the reprojection or rendering of the image, possibly due to non-square pixels or incorrect extent calculations.

To address this, we need to ensure that the source extent and resolution are correctly calculated and applied during the reprojection process. The `calculateSourceExtent` and `calculateSourceResolution` functions should be reviewed to ensure they handle non-square pixels appropriately.

Here is a potential fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj/Image.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const sourceExtent = triangulation.calculateSourceExtent();
const sourceImage = getImageFunction(
  sourceExtent,
  sourceResolution,
  pixelRatio
);
=======
const sourceExtent = triangulation.calculateSourceExtent();
const sourceResolutionX = calculateSourceResolution(
  sourceProj,
  targetProj,
  targetCenter,
  targetResolution,
  'x'
);
const sourceResolutionY = calculateSourceResolution(
  sourceProj,
  targetProj,
  targetCenter,
  targetResolution,
  'y'
);
const sourceResolution = Math.max(sourceResolutionX, sourceResolutionY);
const sourceImage = getImageFunction(
  sourceExtent,
  sourceResolution,
  pixelRatio
);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
1. The `calculateSourceResolution` function is called twice, once for the x-axis and once for the y-axis, to account for non-square pixels.
2. The maximum of the two resolutions is used to ensure that the entire image is covered.
3. This should help in correctly calculating the source extent and resolution, leading to a full display of the COG image.
