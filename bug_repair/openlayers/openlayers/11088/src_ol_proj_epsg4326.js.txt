The issue described is related to the axis order interpretation in proj4js version 2.6.1 and above, which affects the proper rendering of layers in OpenLayers when using certain projections. The problem seems to be related to the axis orientation of the projections, particularly when switching between Mercator and EPSG:2180 projections.

To address this, we need to ensure that the axis orientation is correctly set for the EPSG:4326 projection and any other projections that might be affected. The current code snippet does not directly address the EPSG:2180 projection, but it does set the axis orientation for EPSG:4326. We need to ensure that the axis orientation is correctly specified for all relevant projections.

Here is a potential fix:

```typescript
### src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  constructor(code, opt_axisOrientation) {
    super({
      code: code,
      units: Units.DEGREES,
      extent: EXTENT,
      axisOrientation: opt_axisOrientation,
      global: true,
      metersPerUnit: METERS_PER_UNIT,
      worldExtent: EXTENT,
    });
  }
=======
  constructor(code, opt_axisOrientation) {
    super({
      code: code,
      units: Units.DEGREES,
      extent: EXTENT,
      axisOrientation: opt_axisOrientation || 'neu', // Ensure default axis orientation is set
      global: true,
      metersPerUnit: METERS_PER_UNIT,
      worldExtent: EXTENT,
    });
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, if the EPSG:2180 projection is defined elsewhere in the codebase, we should ensure that its axis orientation is also correctly set. If it is not defined in the provided code snippet, we would need to locate its definition and apply a similar fix.

If the EPSG:2180 projection is defined in a similar manner, the fix might look like this:

```typescript
### src/ol/proj/epsg2180.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  constructor(code, opt_axisOrientation) {
    super({
      code: code,
      units: Units.METERS,
      extent: EPSG2180_EXTENT,
      axisOrientation: opt_axisOrientation,
      global: false,
      metersPerUnit: 1,
      worldExtent: EPSG2180_EXTENT,
    });
  }
=======
  constructor(code, opt_axisOrientation) {
    super({
      code: code,
      units: Units.METERS,
      extent: EPSG2180_EXTENT,
      axisOrientation: opt_axisOrientation || 'enu', // Ensure default axis orientation is set
      global: false,
      metersPerUnit: 1,
      worldExtent: EPSG2180_EXTENT,
    });
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the axis orientation is correctly set for the projections, which should help resolve the issue with the layers being rotated incorrectly when using proj4js version 2.6.1 and above.
