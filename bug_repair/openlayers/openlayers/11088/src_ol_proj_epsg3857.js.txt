The issue described is related to the axis order interpretation in proj4js version 2.6.1 and above, which affects the proper rendering of layers with different projections in OpenLayers. The problem seems to be related to the coordinate transformation between EPSG:3857 (Mercator) and EPSG:2180 (Poland CS92).

To address this, we need to ensure that the coordinate transformations are correctly handling the axis order. The provided code snippet does not directly handle the EPSG:2180 projection, but it does handle the EPSG:3857 projection, which is involved in the issue.

The issue might be related to the transformation functions `fromEPSG4326` and `toEPSG4326`. However, since the problem is with proj4js 2.6.1 and above, we need to ensure that the proj4js definitions for the EPSG:2180 projection are correctly set up.

Here is a potential fix by ensuring that the proj4js definition for EPSG:2180 is correctly set up to handle the axis order:

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/epsg2180.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// No existing code for EPSG:2180 definition
=======
import proj4 from 'proj4';

proj4.defs("EPSG:2180","+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=19 +k=0.9993 +x_0=500000 +y_0=-5300000 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs +axis=enu");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, ensure that the OpenLayers configuration is correctly set up to use the proj4js definitions:

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/proj4.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// No existing code for proj4 setup
=======
import proj4 from 'proj4';
import {get as getProjection} from 'ol/proj';

proj4.defs("EPSG:2180","+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=19 +k=0.9993 +x_0=500000 +y_0=-5300000 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs +axis=enu");

getProjection('EPSG:2180').setAxisOrientation('enu');
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should help in correctly handling the axis order for the EPSG:2180 projection, ensuring that the layers are rendered correctly in OpenLayers when using proj4js 2.6.1 and above.
