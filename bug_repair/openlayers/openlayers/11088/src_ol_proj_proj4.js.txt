The issue described is related to the axis order interpretation in proj4js version 2.6.1 and above, which affects the proper rendering of layers in OpenLayers when using certain projections. The problem seems to be related to how the axis orientation is handled when registering projections with OpenLayers.

To address this, we need to ensure that the axis orientation is correctly set when adding projections. The `axisOrientation` property in the `Projection` object should be set correctly based on the proj4 definition.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/proj4.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
          code: code,
          axisOrientation: def.axis,
          metersPerUnit: def.to_meter,
          units: def.units,
=======
          code: code,
          axisOrientation: def.axis ? def.axis : 'neu', // Default to 'neu' if axis is not defined
          metersPerUnit: def.to_meter,
          units: def.units,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if the `axis` property is not defined in the proj4 definition, it defaults to 'neu', which is a common axis orientation for many projections. This should help in correctly interpreting the axis order and prevent the layers from being rotated incorrectly.
