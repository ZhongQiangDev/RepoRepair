The issue described is related to the axis order interpretation in proj4js version 2.6.1, which affects the rendering of layers in OpenLayers when using certain projections. The problem seems to be related to the axis orientation of the projections, particularly when switching between EPSG:2180 and Mercator projections.

To address this, we need to ensure that the axis orientation is correctly set for the projections being used. The `axisOrientation` property in the `Projection` class is relevant here. We should explicitly set the axis orientation for the EPSG:2180 projection to match the expected behavior.

Here is the proposed fix:

```typescript
### src/ol/proj/Projection.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * @private
     * @type {string}
     */
    this.axisOrientation_ =
      options.axisOrientation !== undefined ? options.axisOrientation : 'enu';
=======
    /**
     * @private
     * @type {string}
     */
    this.axisOrientation_ =
      options.axisOrientation !== undefined ? options.axisOrientation : 'neu';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change sets the default axis orientation to 'neu' (northing, easting, up), which is more appropriate for geographic coordinates like EPSG:2180. This should help in correctly rendering the layers when using proj4js 2.6.1 and above.

Additionally, if the issue persists, you might need to explicitly define the axis orientation when creating the projection object for EPSG:2180:

```typescript
const projEPSG2180 = new Projection({
  code: 'EPSG:2180',
  axisOrientation: 'neu', // Explicitly set the axis orientation
  // other options...
});
```

This ensures that the projection is correctly configured for the specific use case.
