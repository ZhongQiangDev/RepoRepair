The issue described is related to the incorrect layout of connections when reconnecting start/end to form a loop, especially when the connection has more than two waypoints. The problem seems to be in how the waypoints are handled during the reconnect process. The `replaceReconnectedConnection` function is responsible for replacing the connection when the source or target changes. However, it does not seem to handle the waypoints correctly when forming a loop.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the waypoints are recalculated correctly when the connection is reconnected to form a loop. We can achieve this by adding a step to recalculate the waypoints after the connection is replaced.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    replacement = modeling.connect(source, target, {
      type: allowed.type,
      waypoints: connection.waypoints.slice()
    });

    // remove old connection
    modeling.removeConnection(connection);

    // replace connection in context to reconnect end/start
    context.connection = replacement;

    if (dragging) {
      cleanDraggingSelection(connection, replacement);
    }
=======
    replacement = modeling.connect(source, target, {
      type: allowed.type,
      waypoints: connection.waypoints.slice()
    });

    // remove old connection
    modeling.removeConnection(connection);

    // recalculate waypoints for the new connection if it forms a loop
    if (source === target) {
      modeling.updateConnectionWaypoints(replacement);
    }

    // replace connection in context to reconnect end/start
    context.connection = replacement;

    if (dragging) {
      cleanDraggingSelection(connection, replacement);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

In this fix, we added a call to `modeling.updateConnectionWaypoints(replacement)` after the connection is replaced. This function will recalculate the waypoints for the new connection if it forms a loop, ensuring that the layout is correct. Note that `modeling.updateConnectionWaypoints` is a hypothetical function that needs to be implemented or an existing function that performs this task. If such a function does not exist, it would need to be added to the `modeling` service.
