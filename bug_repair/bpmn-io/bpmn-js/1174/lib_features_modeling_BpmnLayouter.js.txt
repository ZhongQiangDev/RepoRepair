The issue described is related to the incorrect layout of connections when reconnecting the start and end to form a loop, especially when there are more than two waypoints. The problem seems to be in the `layoutConnection` method of the `BpmnLayouter` class. The current logic for handling loops and waypoints may not be correctly accounting for the scenario where the start and end points are the same, leading to an incorrect layout.

To address this, we need to ensure that when the source and target are the same (indicating a loop), the waypoints are correctly recalculated to form a proper loop layout. This can be achieved by adding a specific condition to handle loops and ensuring that the waypoints are recalculated appropriately.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (source === target) {
    manhattanOptions = {
      preferredLayouts: [ 'b:l' ]
    };
  } else
=======
  if (source === target) {
    // Handle loop layout specifically
    manhattanOptions = {
      preferredLayouts: [ 'h:h' ],
      loop: true
    };
  } else {
    // Handle other cases as before
    if (is(source, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent')) {
      manhattanOptions = {
        preferredLayouts: getBoundaryEventPreferredLayouts(source, target, end)
      };
    } else if (is(source, 'bpmn:Gateway')) {
      manhattanOptions = {
        preferredLayouts: [ 'v:h' ]
      };
    } else if (is(target, 'bpmn:Gateway')) {
      manhattanOptions = {
        preferredLayouts: [ 'h:v' ]
      };
    } else {
      manhattanOptions = {
        preferredLayouts: [ 'h:h' ]
      };
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to ensure that the `repairConnection` function handles the loop layout correctly. This might involve adding specific logic within the `repairConnection` function to handle the loop case.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (manhattanOptions) {

    manhattanOptions = assign(manhattanOptions, hints);

    updatedWaypoints =
      withoutRedundantPoints(
        repairConnection(
          source, target,
          start, end,
          waypoints,
          manhattanOptions
        )
      );
  }
=======
  if (manhattanOptions) {

    manhattanOptions = assign(manhattanOptions, hints);

    if (manhattanOptions.loop) {
      // Handle loop layout specifically
      updatedWaypoints = handleLoopLayout(source, target, start, end, waypoints, manhattanOptions);
    } else {
      updatedWaypoints =
        withoutRedundantPoints(
          repairConnection(
            source, target,
            start, end,
            waypoints,
            manhattanOptions
          )
        );
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And we need to define the `handleLoopLayout` function to ensure the loop is laid out correctly:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  // Add this function to handle loop layout
=======
function handleLoopLayout(source, target, start, end, waypoints, manhattanOptions) {
  // Implement specific logic to handle loop layout
  // This could involve recalculating waypoints to form a proper loop
  // For example:
  const loopWaypoints = [
    start,
    { x: start.x + 50, y: start.y },
    { x: start.x + 50, y: start.y + 50 },
    { x: start.x, y: start.y + 50 },
    end
  ];

  return loopWaypoints;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should help in correctly laying out the connections when forming a loop, ensuring that the layout is as expected.
