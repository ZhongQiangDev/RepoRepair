The issue described is related to the incorrect layout of connections when reconnecting start/end to form a loop, especially when the connection has more than two waypoints. The problem seems to be in the `updateConnection` method of the `BpmnUpdater` class, where the waypoints of the connection are not being updated correctly when forming a loop.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the waypoints are recalculated when the connection is reconnected to form a loop. This can be achieved by adding a call to a method that recalculates the waypoints after updating the connection's source and target.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  this.updateConnectionWaypoints(connection);

  this.updateDiConnection(businessObject.di, newSource, newTarget);
=======
  this.updateConnectionWaypoints(connection);

  // Recalculate waypoints when forming a loop
  if (newSource === newTarget) {
    this.recalculateWaypoints(connection);
  }

  this.updateDiConnection(businessObject.di, newSource, newTarget);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

We also need to add the `recalculateWaypoints` method to the `BpmnUpdater` class. This method will be responsible for recalculating the waypoints of the connection.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  this.updateDiConnection(businessObject.di, newSource, newTarget);
=======
  this.updateDiConnection(businessObject.di, newSource, newTarget);

  BpmnUpdater.prototype.recalculateWaypoints = function(connection) {
    // Add logic to recalculate waypoints for the connection
    // This could involve calling a layout algorithm or manually adjusting the waypoints
    // For simplicity, let's assume we have a layout algorithm available
    this.layoutAlgorithm.layout(connection);
  };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Note: The `layoutAlgorithm` used in the `recalculateWaypoints` method should be an actual layout algorithm that is available in the `bpmn-js` library or a custom implementation that correctly recalculates the waypoints for the connection. The exact implementation of the layout algorithm is not provided here and should be implemented based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
