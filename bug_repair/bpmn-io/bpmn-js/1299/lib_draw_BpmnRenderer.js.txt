The issue described involves two bugs:

1. **Resizing of labels to minimum bounds when completing direct editing with an empty label**.
2. **Shapes of events and gateways becoming smaller and disappearing when clicked**.

### Bug 1: Resizing of Labels

The first bug is related to the resizing of labels when completing direct editing with an empty label. The issue is linked to a specific commit in the `bpmn-js` repository. To address this, we need to ensure that the label's size is not reduced to a minimum when the label text is empty.

### Bug 2: Shapes Becoming Smaller and Disappearing

The second bug involves the shapes of events and gateways becoming smaller and disappearing when clicked. This issue seems to be related to the rendering logic for these elements. We need to ensure that the rendering logic correctly handles the selection of these elements without altering their size or visibility.

### Code Edits

To address these issues, we need to make changes in the `BpmnRenderer.js` file. Here are the proposed changes:

#### Fix for Bug 1: Resizing of Labels

```javascript
### lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Completing direct editing with an empty label resizes the label target to minimum bounds:
=======
if (element.labelTarget && element.labelTarget.text === '') {
  // Prevent resizing to minimum bounds for empty labels
  element.labelTarget.text = ' ';
}
// Existing code for label rendering
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### Fix for Bug 2: Shapes Becoming Smaller and Disappearing

```javascript
### lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
if (is(element, 'bpmn:Event')) {
  return getCirclePath(element);
}

if (is(element, 'bpmn:Activity')) {
  return getRoundRectPath(element, TASK_BORDER_RADIUS);
}

if (is(element, 'bpmn:Gateway')) {
  return getDiamondPath(element);
}
=======
if (is(element, 'bpmn:Event') || is(element, 'bpmn:Gateway')) {
  // Ensure the shape size is maintained when clicked
  const originalSize = element.width;
  const shapePath = is(element, 'bpmn:Event') ? getCirclePath(element) : getDiamondPath(element);
  element.width = originalSize;
  return shapePath;
}

if (is(element, 'bpmn:Activity')) {
  return getRoundRectPath(element, TASK_BORDER_RADIUS);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should help in fixing the issues described in the bug report. The first set of changes ensures that labels are not resized to minimum bounds when the label text is empty. The second set of changes ensures that the shapes of events and gateways maintain their size and visibility when clicked.
