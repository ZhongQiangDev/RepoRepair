The issue described involves two bugs:

1. **Resizing of labels to minimum bounds when direct editing is completed with an empty label.**
2. **Shapes of events and gateways becoming smaller and disappearing when clicked after upgrading from version 6.3.0 to 6.3.3.**

### Bug 1: Resizing of labels to minimum bounds

The first bug is related to the resizing of labels when direct editing is completed with an empty label. The issue seems to be introduced by the commit `e4e789bd3eecc47597d97d6c8f1e71b941dee066`. The code in `LabelUtil.js` is responsible for calculating the bounds of external labels. The problem might be in the logic that calculates the size of the label when it is empty.

### Bug 2: Shapes of events and gateways becoming smaller and disappearing

The second bug involves the shapes of events and gateways becoming smaller and disappearing when clicked. This issue seems to be related to the logic that handles the selection of these elements. The code in `LabelUtil.js` might not be directly responsible for this, but it could be related to how the bounds of these elements are calculated or how they are rendered.

### Fixing the Bugs

To fix the first bug, we need to ensure that the label size does not get resized to minimum bounds when the label is empty. We can add a check to ensure that the label size remains at a minimum value even if the label text is empty.

To fix the second bug, we need to ensure that the shapes of events and gateways do not change when they are clicked. This might involve checking the logic that handles the selection of these elements and ensuring that their bounds and rendering are not affected.

Here are the proposed fixes:

```javascript
### lib/util/LabelUtil.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function getExternalLabelBounds(semantic, element) {

  var mid,
      size,
      bounds,
      di = semantic.di,
      label = di.label;

  if (label && label.bounds) {
    bounds = label.bounds;

    size = {
      width: Math.max(DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.width, bounds.width),
      height: bounds.height
    };

    mid = {
      x: bounds.x + bounds.width / 2,
      y: bounds.y + bounds.height / 2
    };
  } else {

    mid = getExternalLabelMid(element);

    size = DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE;
  }

  return assign({
    x: mid.x - size.width / 2,
    y: mid.y - size.height / 2
  }, size);
}
=======
export function getExternalLabelBounds(semantic, element) {

  var mid,
      size,
      bounds,
      di = semantic.di,
      label = di.label;

  if (label && label.bounds) {
    bounds = label.bounds;

    // Ensure minimum size for empty labels
    size = {
      width: Math.max(DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.width, bounds.width || DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.width),
      height: Math.max(DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.height, bounds.height || DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.height)
    };

    mid = {
      x: bounds.x + bounds.width / 2,
      y: bounds.y + bounds.height / 2
    };
  } else {

    mid = getExternalLabelMid(element);

    size = DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE;
  }

  return assign({
    x: mid.x - size.width / 2,
    y: mid.y - size.height / 2
  }, size);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

For the second bug, we need to check the logic that handles the selection of events and gateways. This might involve checking the code that handles the rendering and bounds of these elements. Since the code in `LabelUtil.js` is not directly responsible for this, we need to look into other parts of the codebase that handle the selection and rendering of these elements.
