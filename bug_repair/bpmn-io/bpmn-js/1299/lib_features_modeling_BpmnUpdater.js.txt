The issue described involves two bugs:

1. **Resizing of labels to minimum bounds when completing direct editing with an empty label**.
2. **Shapes of events and gateways becoming smaller or disappearing when clicked**.

The first bug is related to the direct editing functionality, while the second is related to the selection of events and gateways.

### Fix for Bug 1: Resizing of labels to minimum bounds

The issue seems to be related to the direct editing functionality, which is not directly shown in the provided code segment. However, the commit mentioned in the issue (`e4e789bd3eecc47597d97d6c8f1e71b941dee066`) likely introduced the bug. We need to ensure that the label size is not set to minimum bounds when the label text is empty.

### Fix for Bug 2: Shapes of events and gateways becoming smaller or disappearing

The second bug is related to the selection of events and gateways. The issue might be in the way the selection is handled, possibly in the `BpmnUpdater` class. We need to ensure that the selection does not alter the shape or visibility of the elements.

Here is the proposed fix for the second bug:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnUpdater.prototype.updateConnection = function(context) {
=======
BpmnUpdater.prototype.updateConnection = function(context) {

  // Ensure the selected elements do not change shape or disappear
  if (context.element && isAny(context.element, ['bpmn:Event', 'bpmn:Gateway'])) {
    return;
  }

  var connection = context.connection,
      businessObject = getBusinessObject(connection),
      newSource = getBusinessObject(connection.source),
      newTarget = getBusinessObject(connection.target),
      visualParent;

  if (!is(businessObject, 'bpmn:DataAssociation')) {

    var inverseSet = is(businessObject, 'bpmn:SequenceFlow');

    if (businessObject.sourceRef !== newSource) {
      if (inverseSet) {
        collectionRemove(businessObject.sourceRef && businessObject.sourceRef.get('outgoing'), businessObject);

        if (newSource && newSource.get('outgoing')) {
          newSource.get('outgoing').push(businessObject);
        }
      }

      businessObject.sourceRef = newSource;
    }

    if (businessObject.targetRef !== newTarget) {
      if (inverseSet) {
        collectionRemove(businessObject.targetRef && businessObject.targetRef.get('incoming'), businessObject);

        if (newTarget && newTarget.get('incoming')) {
          newTarget.get('incoming').push(businessObject);
        }
      }

      businessObject.targetRef = newTarget;
    }
  } else

  if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:DataInputAssociation')) {

    // handle obnoxious isMsome sourceRef
    businessObject.get('sourceRef')[0] = newSource;

    visualParent = context.parent || context.newParent || newTarget;

    this.updateSemanticParent(businessObject, newTarget, visualParent);
  } else

  if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:DataOutputAssociation')) {
    visualParent = context.parent || context.newParent || newSource;

    this.updateSemanticParent(businessObject, newSource, visualParent);

    // targetRef = new target
    businessObject.targetRef = newTarget;
  }

  this.updateConnectionWaypoints(connection);

  this.updateDiConnection(businessObject.di, newSource, newTarget);
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when an event or gateway is selected, the `updateConnection` function does not alter the shape or visibility of the elements. This should resolve the second bug. The first bug requires a different approach, possibly in the direct editing functionality, which is not shown in the provided code segment.
