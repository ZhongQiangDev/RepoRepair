To address the issue where the space tool resizes an empty pool vertically, we need to ensure that empty pools are not resized when the space tool is used. The current code filters out text annotations but does not handle empty pools. We need to add a condition to filter out empty pools as well.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/space-tool/BpmnSpaceTool.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  adjustments.resizingShapes = adjustments.resizingShapes.filter(function(shape) {
    return !is(shape, 'bpmn:TextAnnotation');
  });
=======
  adjustments.resizingShapes = adjustments.resizingShapes.filter(function(shape) {
    return !is(shape, 'bpmn:TextAnnotation') && !is(shape, 'bpmn:Pool');
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that empty pools are not resized when the space tool is used.
