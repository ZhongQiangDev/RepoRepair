The issue described is related to an `illegal invocation` error when deleting an element while direct editing is active. The error occurs in the `element.updateLabel` action. The problem seems to be that the direct editing is not properly canceled before the element is deleted, leading to an illegal invocation when the label update tries to execute on a non-existent element.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the direct editing is canceled before the element is deleted. We can do this by adding a check in the `shape.remove` and `connection.remove` event handlers to cancel direct editing if it is active on the element being removed.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  eventBus.on([
    'shape.remove',
    'connection.remove'
  ], function(event) {

    if (directEditing.isActive(event.element)) {
      directEditing.cancel();
    }
  });
=======
  eventBus.on([
    'shape.remove',
    'connection.remove'
  ], function(event) {

    // Ensure direct editing is canceled before removing the element
    if (directEditing.isActive(event.element)) {
      directEditing.cancel();
    }

    // Additional check to cancel direct editing for related elements
    if (event.element && event.element.businessObject) {
      var relatedElements = getRelatedElements(event.element);
      relatedElements.forEach(function(relatedElement) {
        if (directEditing.isActive(relatedElement)) {
          directEditing.cancel();
        }
      });
    }
  });

  // Helper function to get related elements (e.g., labels, connections)
  function getRelatedElements(element) {
    var relatedElements = [];

    // Add logic to find related elements based on the element type
    // For example, if the element is a shape, find its label and connections
    if (isLabel(element)) {
      relatedElements.push(element.parent);
    } else if (hasExternalLabel(element)) {
      relatedElements.push(getExternalLabelMid(element));
    }

    return relatedElements;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that direct editing is canceled for the element being removed and any related elements, preventing the `illegal invocation` error. The `getRelatedElements` function is a helper function that can be customized based on the specific logic of your application to find related elements that might also be affected by the removal of the main element.
