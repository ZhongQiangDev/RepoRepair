The issue described is related to an `illegal invocation` error when deleting an element while direct editing is active. The error occurs in the `element.updateLabel` action within the `Modeling` class. The problem seems to be related to the execution of the command stack when the label is being updated.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `element.updateLabel` command is only executed when the element is still valid and not in the process of being deleted. We can add a check to verify the element's state before executing the command.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Modeling.prototype.updateLabel = function(element, newLabel, newBounds, hints) {
  this._commandStack.execute('element.updateLabel', {
    element: element,
    newLabel: newLabel,
    newBounds: newBounds,
    hints: hints || {}
  });
};
=======
Modeling.prototype.updateLabel = function(element, newLabel, newBounds, hints) {
  // Check if the element is still valid before executing the command
  if (element && element.businessObject) {
    this._commandStack.execute('element.updateLabel', {
      element: element,
      newLabel: newLabel,
      newBounds: newBounds,
      hints: hints || {}
    });
  }
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `element.updateLabel` command is only executed if the element is still valid and not in the process of being deleted. This should prevent the `illegal invocation` error from occurring.
