The issue described involves disallowing typed start events inside non-event-based sub-processes and ensuring that when a start event is moved into a sub-process, its type is dropped. The provided code does not directly address these requirements. To implement the necessary changes, we need to add logic to handle these specific cases.

Here's how we can modify the `CreateBehavior.js` file to address the issue:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { getParent } from '../util/ModelingUtil';
=======

import { getParent, isStartEvent } from '../util/ModelingUtil';

this.preExecute('shape.create', 1500, function(event) {
  var context = event.context,
      parent = context.parent,
      shape = context.shape;

  if (is(parent, 'bpmn:Lane') && !is(shape, 'bpmn:Lane')) {
    context.parent = getParent(parent, 'bpmn:Participant');
  }

  // Disallow morphing to typed start event inside sub-process
  if (is(parent, 'bpmn:SubProcess') && isStartEvent(shape) && shape.eventDefinition) {
    throw new Error('Typed start events are not allowed inside sub-processes.');
  }
});

this.postExecute('shape.move', function(event) {
  var context = event.context,
      shape = context.shape,
      targetParent = context.targetParent;

  // Drop event type when moving start event to sub-process
  if (is(targetParent, 'bpmn:SubProcess') && isStartEvent(shape)) {
    shape.eventDefinition = null;
  }
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
1. **Import `isStartEvent`**: We need a utility function to check if a shape is a start event.
2. **Prevent Morphing to Typed Start Event**: In the `preExecute` method, we check if the parent is a sub-process and if the shape is a typed start event. If so, we throw an error.
3. **Drop Event Type on Move**: In the `postExecute` method, we check if the target parent is a sub-process and if the shape is a start event. If so, we set the `eventDefinition` to `null` to drop the event type.

This solution ensures that typed start events are not allowed inside sub-processes and that the event type is dropped when a start event is moved into a sub-process.
