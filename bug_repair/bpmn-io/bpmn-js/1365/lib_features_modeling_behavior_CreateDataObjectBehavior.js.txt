The issue is about implementing the ability to toggle the `isCollection` property on a data object, input, and output. The current code does not handle this feature. To address this, we need to modify the `CreateDataObjectBehavior` to include the `isCollection` property and provide a way to toggle it.

Here's the proposed solution:

1. Add the `isCollection` property to the `DataObject` when it is created.
2. Implement a method to toggle the `isCollection` property.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateDataObjectBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      // create a DataObject every time a DataObjectReference is created
      var dataObject = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:DataObject');

      // set the reference to the DataObject
      shape.businessObject.dataObjectRef = dataObject;
=======
      // create a DataObject every time a DataObjectReference is created
      var dataObject = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:DataObject', {
        isCollection: false // Initialize isCollection property
      });

      // set the reference to the DataObject
      shape.businessObject.dataObjectRef = dataObject;

      // Add method to toggle isCollection property
      shape.businessObject.toggleIsCollection = function() {
        this.dataObjectRef.isCollection = !this.dataObjectRef.isCollection;
      };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This code modification initializes the `isCollection` property to `false` when a `DataObject` is created and adds a method `toggleIsCollection` to the `shape.businessObject` to toggle the `isCollection` property. This allows the user to switch between a regular data object and a collection data object as described in the issue.
