The issue is about implementing the ability to toggle the `isCollection` property on a data object, input, and output in BPMN 2.0. The provided code snippet does not directly address this issue. However, we can infer that the `BpmnFactory` class is responsible for creating BPMN elements, and we need to modify it to support the `isCollection` property.

To fix this issue, we need to add a method to the `BpmnFactory` class that allows setting the `isCollection` property when creating a data object, input, or output. Here's the proposed solution:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnFactory.prototype.create = function(type, attrs) {
  var element = this._model.create(type, attrs || {});

  this._ensureId(element);

  return element;
};
=======
BpmnFactory.prototype.create = function(type, attrs) {
  var element = this._model.create(type, attrs || {});

  // Set isCollection property if provided in attrs
  if (attrs && attrs.isCollection !== undefined) {
    element.isCollection = attrs.isCollection;
  }

  this._ensureId(element);

  return element;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification allows the `create` method to accept an `isCollection` attribute in the `attrs` parameter and sets it on the created element if provided. This should enable the toggling of the `isCollection` property as requested in the issue.
