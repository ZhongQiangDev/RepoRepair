The issue described is related to the serialization of `waypoints` in the `sequenceFlow` element when a connection has a middle segment. The problem is that the `waypoints` property is being serialized as `[object Object]` instead of the actual coordinates. This suggests that the serialization process is not correctly handling the `waypoints` array.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `waypoints` array is properly serialized to XML. This likely involves modifying the serialization logic to correctly convert the `waypoints` array into a string of coordinates.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function getWaypoints(bo, source, target) {

  var waypoints = bo.di.waypoint;

  if (!waypoints || waypoints.length < 2) {
    return [ getMid(source), getMid(target) ];
  }

  return waypoints.map(function(p) {
    return { x: p.x, y: p.y };
  });
}
=======
function getWaypoints(bo, source, target) {

  var waypoints = bo.di.waypoint;

  if (!waypoints || waypoints.length < 2) {
    return [ getMid(source), getMid(target) ];
  }

  return waypoints.map(function(p) {
    return { x: p.x, y: p.y };
  }).map(function(point) {
    return `${point.x},${point.y}`;
  }).join(' ');
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that each waypoint is converted to a string of the form `x,y` and then all waypoints are joined with a space, which should be the correct format for serialization in the XML.
