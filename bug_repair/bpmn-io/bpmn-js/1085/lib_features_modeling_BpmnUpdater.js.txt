The issue described is related to the serialization of `waypoints` in the `sequenceFlow` element when a middle segment is present. The problem seems to be that the `waypoints` property is being serialized as a string representation of an object (`[object Object]`) instead of the actual coordinates.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `waypoints` are properly serialized as a list of coordinates. This likely involves modifying the serialization logic for `sequenceFlow` elements.

Since the provided code segment does not contain the relevant serialization logic, we need to search for the part of the code that handles the serialization of `sequenceFlow` elements. This is likely to be in a file related to BPMN model serialization.

Assuming the serialization logic is in a file named `BpmnSerializer.js`, the fix would involve ensuring that the `waypoints` are serialized correctly.

Here is a hypothetical fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnSerializer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function serializeSequenceFlow(flow) {
  var bo = getBusinessObject(flow);
  var waypoints = flow.waypoints;

  if (waypoints && waypoints.length > 0) {
    bo.waypoints = waypoints.map(function(point) {
      return {
        x: point.x,
        y: point.y
      };
    });
  }
}
=======
function serializeSequenceFlow(flow) {
  var bo = getBusinessObject(flow);
  var waypoints = flow.waypoints;

  if (waypoints && waypoints.length > 0) {
    bo.waypoints = waypoints.map(function(point) {
      return 'x="' + point.x + '" y="' + point.y + '"';
    }).join(' ');
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix assumes that the `waypoints` should be serialized as a space-separated list of `x` and `y` coordinates. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific serialization requirements of the BPMN model.

If the serialization logic is in a different file or has a different structure, the search and replace blocks would need to be adjusted accordingly.
