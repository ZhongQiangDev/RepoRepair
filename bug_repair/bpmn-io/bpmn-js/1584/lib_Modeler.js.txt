The issue described involves inconsistent behavior when adding, undoing, and redoing the addition of a participant in the BPMN model, as well as a bug related to copying a pool and resulting in duplicate IDs. The code provided is the `Modeler.js` file, which initializes the BPMN modeler and its modules. However, the specific logic for handling participants, undo/redo actions, and copying pools is not directly visible in this file. Therefore, the bug likely resides in other parts of the codebase that handle these specific functionalities.

To address the issue, we need to ensure that the ID of the process remains consistent when undoing and redoing the addition of a participant. Additionally, we need to ensure that when copying a pool, the IDs are properly managed to avoid duplicates.

Since the provided code does not contain the specific logic for these functionalities, we can only suggest a general approach to fix the issue. Here's a conceptual fix:

1. Ensure that the process ID is preserved during undo/redo operations.
2. Ensure that when copying a pool, new unique IDs are generated for the copied elements.

Here's a conceptual `SEARCH/REPLACE` edit for the first issue (assuming the relevant code is in a different file):

```javascript
### src/features/modeling/ParticipantHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function addParticipant(modeling, element) {
  const newParticipant = modeling.createParticipant(element);
  return newParticipant;
}
=======
function addParticipant(modeling, element) {
  const newParticipant = modeling.createParticipant(element);
  // Ensure the process ID is preserved
  newParticipant.id = element.id;
  return newParticipant;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

And for the second issue:

```javascript
### src/features/copy-paste/CopyPasteHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function copyPool(pool) {
  const copiedPool = pool.copy();
  return copiedPool;
}
=======
function copyPool(pool) {
  const copiedPool = pool.copy();
  // Generate new unique IDs for the copied elements
  copiedPool.id = generateUniqueId();
  copiedPool.elements.forEach(element => {
    element.id = generateUniqueId();
  });
  return copiedPool;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that these are conceptual edits and the actual implementation may vary based on the specific codebase and architecture. The `generateUniqueId` function should be implemented to ensure unique IDs are generated for the copied elements.
