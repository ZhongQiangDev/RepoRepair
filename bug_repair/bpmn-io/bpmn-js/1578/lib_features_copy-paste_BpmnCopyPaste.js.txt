The issue described is related to duplicate Pool IDs when copying and pasting a Pool in the BPMN diagram. The provided code snippet is responsible for copying and pasting elements, including Pools. The problem seems to be that the `id` attribute of the copied Pool is not being properly updated, leading to duplicate IDs.

To fix this, we need to ensure that when a Pool is copied, its `id` is generated uniquely for the new Pool. This can be done by modifying the `copyPaste.pasteElement` event handler to generate a new unique ID for the copied Pool.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type);

    descriptor.businessObject = moddleCopy.copyElement(
      oldBusinessObject,
      newBusinessObject
    );
=======
    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type, { id: bpmnFactory.nextId() });

    descriptor.businessObject = moddleCopy.copyElement(
      oldBusinessObject,
      newBusinessObject
    );

    // Ensure the new Pool has a unique ID
    if (is(newBusinessObject, 'bpmn:Pool')) {
      newBusinessObject.id = bpmnFactory.nextId('Pool_');
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when a Pool is copied, it gets a new unique ID, preventing the duplicate ID issue. The `bpmnFactory.nextId()` function is used to generate a new unique ID, and for Pools, we specifically use `bpmnFactory.nextId('Pool_')` to ensure the ID starts with "Pool_" as is typical for Pool elements.
