The issue described is about rendering the names of message elements on message flows in BPMN diagrams. The provided code snippet does not directly address the rendering of message elements or their names. However, based on the issue description, we need to ensure that the names of message elements are rendered below the message flows.

To address this, we need to modify the rendering logic for message flows to include the names of the message elements. This typically involves changes in the rendering or layout modules of the BPMN diagram library.

Since the provided code snippet is from `DiUtil.js`, which seems to be related to utility functions for BPMN diagrams, it is unlikely that the bug fix would be in this file. Instead, we would need to look into the rendering or layout modules.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that we need to add a function in `DiUtil.js` that can be used to retrieve the name of a message element, which can then be used by the rendering logic.

Here is a hypothetical fix:

```javascript
### lib/util/DiUtil.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function hasEventDefinition(element, eventType) {
  var bo = getBusinessObject(element),
      hasEventDefinition = false;

  if (bo.eventDefinitions) {
    forEach(bo.eventDefinitions, function(event) {
      if (is(event, eventType)) {
        hasEventDefinition = true;
      }
    });
  }

  return hasEventDefinition;
}
=======
export function hasEventDefinition(element, eventType) {
  var bo = getBusinessObject(element),
      hasEventDefinition = false;

  if (bo.eventDefinitions) {
    forEach(bo.eventDefinitions, function(event) {
      if (is(event, eventType)) {
        hasEventDefinition = true;
      }
    });
  }

  return hasEventDefinition;
}

export function getMessageElementName(element) {
  var bo = getBusinessObject(element);
  return bo.name || '';
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix adds a new function `getMessageElementName` that retrieves the name of a message element. This function can then be used by the rendering logic to display the name of the message element below the message flow.

However, the actual fix would likely involve changes in the rendering or layout modules of the BPMN diagram library, which are not shown in the provided code snippet.
