The issue described is related to the direct editing being activated after pasting certain elements, specifically when a task is in the first position. The provided code snippet does not directly address the pasting functionality or the direct editing behavior. However, based on the issue description and the video, it seems that the problem might be related to the selection or focus behavior after pasting elements.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that direct editing is not activated after pasting elements. This might involve modifying the code that handles the pasting of elements or the selection behavior.

Since the provided code snippet does not contain the relevant logic, I will assume that the logic for handling pasting and selection is located in another file. For the sake of this example, let's assume the relevant code is in a file named `PasteHandler.js`.

Here is a potential fix:

```javascript
### src/lib/features/paste/PasteHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function handlePaste(elements) {
  // Existing code for handling paste
  selectElements(elements);
  activateDirectEditing(elements[0]);
}
=======
function handlePaste(elements) {
  // Existing code for handling paste
  selectElements(elements);
  // Do not activate direct editing after pasting
  // activateDirectEditing(elements[0]);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix assumes that the `activateDirectEditing` function is responsible for activating direct editing after pasting. By commenting out this line, we prevent direct editing from being activated after pasting elements.

If the actual code is different, you would need to locate the relevant function that handles the pasting and selection behavior and make the necessary changes to prevent direct editing from being activated.
