The issue described is that associations on `bpmn:BoundaryEvents` are not being rendered correctly after the BPMN diagram is exported and re-imported. The problem seems to be related to how the associations are handled during the import process.

The code provided includes a function `handleBoundaryEvent` which is responsible for handling boundary events. However, it seems that the associations related to boundary events are not being processed correctly. To fix this, we need to ensure that the associations are handled properly when processing boundary events.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/import/BpmnTreeWalker.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function handleBoundaryEvent(dataObject, context) {
    visitIfDi(dataObject, context);
}
=======
function handleBoundaryEvent(boundaryEvent, context) {
    var gfx = visitIfDi(boundaryEvent, context);

    // Handle associations related to the boundary event
    if (boundaryEvent.dataInputAssociations) {
        boundaryEvent.dataInputAssociations.forEach(function(association) {
            handleDataAssociation(association, context);
        });
    }

    if (boundaryEvent.dataOutputAssociations) {
        boundaryEvent.dataOutputAssociations.forEach(function(association) {
            handleDataAssociation(association, context);
        });
    }

    return gfx;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that any data input and output associations related to the boundary event are processed when the boundary event is handled. This should resolve the issue of associations not being rendered correctly after re-importing the BPMN diagram.
