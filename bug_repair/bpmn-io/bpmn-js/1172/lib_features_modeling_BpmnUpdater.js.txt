The issue described is that associations on `bpmn:BoundaryEvents` are not being rendered correctly after the model is exported and re-imported. This suggests that the associations are not being properly saved or restored in the BPMN XML.

To address this, we need to ensure that the associations are correctly handled during the update process. Specifically, we need to make sure that the associations are properly updated when the boundary event is attached to a host element.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnUpdater.prototype.updateAttachment = function(context) {

  var shape = context.shape,
      businessObject = shape.businessObject,
      host = shape.host;

  businessObject.attachedToRef = host && host.businessObject;
};
=======
BpmnUpdater.prototype.updateAttachment = function(context) {

  var shape = context.shape,
      businessObject = shape.businessObject,
      host = shape.host;

  businessObject.attachedToRef = host && host.businessObject;

  // Ensure associations are properly updated when the boundary event is attached
  if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent')) {
    var associations = businessObject.get('dataInputAssociations') || [];
    associations.forEach(function(association) {
      this.updateSemanticParent(association, host && host.businessObject);
    }, this);
  }
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when a boundary event is attached to a host, any data input associations it has are also updated to reflect the new parent. This should help in correctly rendering the associations after the model is exported and re-imported.
