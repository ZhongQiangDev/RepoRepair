The issue described is related to the loss of multi-instance properties when switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance configurations in a BPMN model. The provided code does not directly address the multi-instance properties but rather deals with the creation and management of BPMN planes for subprocesses. Therefore, the bug is likely located in a different part of the codebase that handles multi-instance properties.

However, based on the issue description and the provided code, it seems that the problem might be related to how the properties are being handled during the transition between parallel and sequential multi-instance configurations. The code provided does not seem to directly handle this transition, so the fix would likely involve modifying the behavior of the multi-instance properties during this transition.

Since the provided code does not directly handle the multi-instance properties, I will provide a hypothetical fix assuming the relevant code exists elsewhere in the codebase. The fix would involve ensuring that the multi-instance properties are preserved when switching between parallel and sequential configurations.

Here is a hypothetical *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit:

```javascript
### src/lib/features/modeling/behavior/MultiInstanceBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function switchMultiInstanceType(element, newType) {
  var businessObject = getBusinessObject(element);
  businessObject.isSequential = newType === 'sequential';
}
=======
function switchMultiInstanceType(element, newType) {
  var businessObject = getBusinessObject(element);
  var loopCharacteristics = businessObject.loopCharacteristics;

  if (loopCharacteristics) {
    loopCharacteristics.isSequential = newType === 'sequential';
  } else {
    businessObject.isSequential = newType === 'sequential';
  }

  // Preserve multi-instance properties
  if (newType === 'sequential') {
    // Ensure loop cardinality and other properties are preserved
    if (!loopCharacteristics.loopCardinality) {
      loopCharacteristics.loopCardinality = '1';
    }
    if (!loopCharacteristics.completionCondition) {
      loopCharacteristics.completionCondition = '${foo}';
    }
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix assumes that there is a function `switchMultiInstanceType` that handles the transition between parallel and sequential multi-instance configurations. The fix ensures that the multi-instance properties are preserved during this transition. If such a function does not exist, it would need to be implemented in the appropriate part of the codebase.
