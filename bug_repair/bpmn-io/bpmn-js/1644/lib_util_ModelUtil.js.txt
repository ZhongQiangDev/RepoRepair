The issue described is related to the loss of multi-instance properties when switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance configurations in a BPMN model. The provided code snippet does not directly relate to the issue, as it is part of a utility file for model operations. However, the issue likely lies in the BPMN modeler's handling of multi-instance properties during the switch between parallel and sequential configurations.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the multi-instance properties are preserved when switching between parallel and sequential configurations. This typically involves modifying the BPMN modeler's behavior in the relevant part of the codebase that handles multi-instance configurations.

Since the provided code snippet does not contain the relevant logic, we need to identify the correct file and code segment that handles multi-instance configurations. Assuming the relevant code is in a file like `MultiInstanceHandler.js`, the fix might involve ensuring that the properties are correctly transferred during the switch.

Here is a hypothetical fix assuming the relevant code is in `MultiInstanceHandler.js`:

```javascript
### src/MultiInstanceHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function switchMultiInstanceType(element, newType) {
  const bo = getBusinessObject(element);
  const multiInstance = bo.get('multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics');
  
  if (newType === 'parallel') {
    multiInstance.isSequential = false;
  } else if (newType === 'sequential') {
    multiInstance.isSequential = true;
  }
}
=======
function switchMultiInstanceType(element, newType) {
  const bo = getBusinessObject(element);
  const multiInstance = bo.get('multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics');
  
  if (newType === 'parallel') {
    multiInstance.isSequential = false;
  } else if (newType === 'sequential') {
    multiInstance.isSequential = true;
  }

  // Preserve multi-instance properties
  const properties = {
    loopCardinality: multiInstance.loopCardinality,
    collection: multiInstance.collection,
    elementVariable: multiInstance.elementVariable,
    completionCondition: multiInstance.completionCondition
  };

  // Apply preserved properties
  multiInstance.loopCardinality = properties.loopCardinality;
  multiInstance.collection = properties.collection;
  multiInstance.elementVariable = properties.elementVariable;
  multiInstance.completionCondition = properties.completionCondition;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix ensures that the multi-instance properties are preserved when switching between parallel and sequential configurations. The actual file and code segment may differ, but the approach should be similar.
