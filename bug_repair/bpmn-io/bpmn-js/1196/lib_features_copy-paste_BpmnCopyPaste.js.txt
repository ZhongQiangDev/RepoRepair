The issue described is that when a Boundary Event is copied along with the object it's attached to, the copied Boundary Event is not attached to the copied object. The expected behavior is that the copied Boundary Event should be automatically attached to the copied task.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `attachedToRef` property of the Boundary Event is correctly copied and updated when the task is copied. This involves modifying the `copyPaste.pasteElement` event handler to handle the Boundary Event's attachment properly.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElement', function(context) {
    var cache = context.cache,
        descriptor = context.descriptor,
        oldBusinessObject = descriptor.oldBusinessObject,
        newBusinessObject;

    // do NOT copy business object if external label
    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {
      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[ descriptor.labelTarget ]);

      return;
    }

    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type);

    descriptor.businessObject = moddleCopy.copyElement(
      oldBusinessObject,
      newBusinessObject
    );

    // resolve references e.g. default sequence flow
    resolveReferences(descriptor);

    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, [
      'isExpanded',
      'name'
    ]);

    removeProperties(descriptor, 'oldBusinessObject');
});

eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElement', function(context) {
    var cache = context.cache,
        descriptor = context.descriptor,
        oldBusinessObject = descriptor.oldBusinessObject,
        newBusinessObject;

    // do NOT copy business object if external label
    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {
      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[ descriptor.labelTarget ]);

      return;
    }

    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type);

    descriptor.businessObject = moddleCopy.copyElement(
      oldBusinessObject,
      newBusinessObject
    );

    // resolve references e.g. default sequence flow
    resolveReferences(descriptor);

    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, [
      'isExpanded',
      'name'
    ]);

    // Handle Boundary Event attachment
    if (is(oldBusinessObject, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent') && oldBusinessObject.attachedToRef) {
      var attachedToRefId = oldBusinessObject.attachedToRef.id;
      var newAttachedToRef = cache[attachedToRefId].businessObject;
      newBusinessObject.attachedToRef = newAttachedToRef;
    }

    removeProperties(descriptor, 'oldBusinessObject');
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures that when a Boundary Event is copied, its `attachedToRef` property is correctly updated to reference the copied task. This should resolve the issue where the copied Boundary Event is not attached to the copied task.
