The issue described is that when the label of a Task is removed, the `di.label` property still exists with a value of `null`, which causes problems with other tools like linting. To fix this, we need to ensure that when the label is removed, the `di.label` property is also removed from the model.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (!text) {
    return;
  }
=======
  if (!text) {
    // Remove the label property from the DI if the text is empty
    var di = getDi(element);
    if (di && di.label) {
      delete di.label;
    }
    return;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when the label text is empty, the `di.label` property is deleted from the model, preventing it from causing issues with other tools.
