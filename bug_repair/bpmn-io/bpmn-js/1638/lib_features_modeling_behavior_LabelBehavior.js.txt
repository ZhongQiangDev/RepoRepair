The issue described is that when the label of a Task is removed, the `di.label` property still exists with a value of `null`, which causes problems with other tools like linting. The fix involves ensuring that the `di.label` property is completely removed when the label is cleared.

The relevant code segment is in the `LabelBehavior` class, specifically in the `postExecute` function for the `shape.delete` event. This function updates the label after a label shape is deleted, but it does not remove the `di.label` property when the label is cleared.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  this.postExecute('shape.delete', function(event) {
    var context = event.context,
        labelTarget = context.labelTarget,
        hints = context.hints || {};

    // check if label
    if (labelTarget && hints.unsetLabel !== false) {
      modeling.updateLabel(labelTarget, null, null, { removeShape: false });
    }
  });
=======
  this.postExecute('shape.delete', function(event) {
    var context = event.context,
        labelTarget = context.labelTarget,
        hints = context.hints || {};

    // check if label
    if (labelTarget && hints.unsetLabel !== false) {
      var di = getDi(labelTarget);
      if (di && di.label) {
        delete di.label;
      }
      modeling.updateLabel(labelTarget, null, null, { removeShape: false });
    }
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `di.label` property is deleted when the label is cleared, which should resolve the issue with other tools like linting.
