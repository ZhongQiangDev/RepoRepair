The issue described is related to the inability to connect two tasks center-to-center due to the introduction of grid snapping and connection previews. The provided code segment is related to grid snapping, but it does not directly address the connection behavior between tasks. To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the connection logic allows for center-to-center snapping.

Since the provided code segment does not directly address the connection logic, we need to look for the relevant code that handles connections between tasks. However, based on the given code, we can infer that the grid snapping logic might need to be adjusted to accommodate center-to-center connections.

Here is a potential fix that adjusts the grid snapping context to include center-to-center snapping:

```javascript
### lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (isAny(shape, [
      'bpmn:Participant',
      'bpmn:SubProcess',
      'bpmn:TextAnnotation'
    ])) {
      if (!context.gridSnappingContext) {
        context.gridSnappingContext = {};
      }

      context.gridSnappingContext.snapLocation = 'top-left';
=======
    if (isAny(shape, [
      'bpmn:Participant',
      'bpmn:SubProcess',
      'bpmn:TextAnnotation',
      'bpmn:Task' // Add Task to the list of shapes that use grid snapping
    ])) {
      if (!context.gridSnappingContext) {
        context.gridSnappingContext = {};
      }

      // Adjust snapLocation to allow center-to-center snapping
      context.gridSnappingContext.snapLocation = 'center';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the grid snapping logic is applied to tasks and allows for center-to-center snapping. However, this is a simplified solution, and the actual fix might require more comprehensive changes to the connection logic. If the issue persists, further investigation into the connection handling code would be necessary.
