The issue described is that the center-to-center snapping functionality is not working as expected after the introduction of connection previews and grid snapping. The provided code snippet is responsible for handling snapping during the connection process. To address the issue, we need to ensure that the center-to-center snapping is explicitly handled.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (target && isAnyType(connectionAttrs, [
      'bpmn:Association',
      'bpmn:DataInputAssociation',
      'bpmn:DataOutputAssociation',
      'bpmn:SequenceFlow'
    ])) {

      // snap source
      context.sourcePosition = mid(source);

      if (is(source, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent') && target === source.host) {
        snapBoundaryEventLoop(event, source, target);
      }
    } else if (isType(connectionAttrs, 'bpmn:MessageFlow')) {
=======
    if (target && isAnyType(connectionAttrs, [
      'bpmn:Association',
      'bpmn:DataInputAssociation',
      'bpmn:DataOutputAssociation',
      'bpmn:SequenceFlow'
    ])) {

      // snap source and target to their centers
      context.sourcePosition = mid(source);
      context.targetPosition = mid(target);

      if (is(source, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent') && target === source.host) {
        snapBoundaryEventLoop(event, source, target);
      }
    } else if (isType(connectionAttrs, 'bpmn:MessageFlow')) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that both the source and target positions are snapped to their respective centers when connecting tasks, addressing the issue of center-to-center snapping not working as expected.
