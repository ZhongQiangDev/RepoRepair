The issue described is related to the loss of multi-instance properties when switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance configurations in a BPMN model. The provided code snippet does not directly address this issue, as it focuses on updating flow node references within lanes. However, the issue likely stems from the BPMN modeler's behavior when changing the multi-instance type.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the multi-instance properties are preserved when switching between parallel and sequential configurations. This typically involves modifying the BPMN modeler's behavior for handling multi-instance properties.

Since the provided code does not directly relate to the multi-instance properties, we need to look for the relevant code that handles multi-instance configurations. This code is likely located in a different file within the BPMN modeler's codebase.

Assuming we have identified the relevant file and code segment, here is an example of how we might modify the code to preserve multi-instance properties:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/UpdateMultiInstanceBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function updateMultiInstanceProperties(element, newType) {
  // Existing code to update multi-instance properties
  // ...
}
=======
function updateMultiInstanceProperties(element, newType) {
  // Preserve existing multi-instance properties
  const existingProperties = {
    loopCardinality: element.multiInstance.loopCardinality,
    collection: element.multiInstance.collection,
    elementVariable: element.multiInstance.elementVariable,
    completionCondition: element.multiInstance.completionCondition
  };

  // Update multi-instance type
  element.multiInstance.isSequential = newType === 'sequential';

  // Restore preserved properties
  element.multiInstance.loopCardinality = existingProperties.loopCardinality;
  element.multiInstance.collection = existingProperties.collection;
  element.multiInstance.elementVariable = existingProperties.elementVariable;
  element.multiInstance.completionCondition = existingProperties.completionCondition;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This example assumes that the `updateMultiInstanceProperties` function is responsible for updating the multi-instance properties when switching between parallel and sequential configurations. The modified code preserves the existing multi-instance properties before updating the multi-instance type and then restores the preserved properties.

Please note that the actual file path and function name may differ based on the BPMN modeler's codebase. The provided example is a general guideline for addressing the issue.
