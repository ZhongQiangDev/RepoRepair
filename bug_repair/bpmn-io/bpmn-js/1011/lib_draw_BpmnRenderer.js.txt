To address the issue where group elements are not rendered on top of all other elements, we need to ensure that the group elements are drawn last or have a higher z-index in the rendering process. This can be achieved by modifying the rendering logic in the `BpmnRenderer` class.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnRenderer.prototype.drawShape = function(parentGfx, element) {
  var type = element.type;
  var h = this.handlers[type];

  /* jshint -W040 */
  return h(parentGfx, element);
};
=======
BpmnRenderer.prototype.drawShape = function(parentGfx, element) {
  var type = element.type;
  var h = this.handlers[type];

  /* jshint -W040 */
  var shape = h(parentGfx, element);

  // Ensure group elements are rendered on top
  if (element.type === 'bpmn:Group') {
    parentGfx.appendChild(shape);
  }

  return shape;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures that when a group element is rendered, it is appended to the parent graphics element, which effectively places it on top of other elements. This should resolve the issue where group borders are not hidden behind new elements as expected.
