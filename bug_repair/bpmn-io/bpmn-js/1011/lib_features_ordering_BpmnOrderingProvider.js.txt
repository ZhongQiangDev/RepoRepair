The issue described is that group elements are not rendered on top of all other elements. The screenshot shows a group border not being hidden behind a new element, which is contrary to the expected behavior. To fix this, we need to ensure that group elements are given a higher rendering order.

The `BpmnOrderingProvider` function defines the order in which elements are rendered. We need to add an entry for group elements and give them a high `level` value to ensure they are rendered on top.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/ordering/BpmnOrderingProvider.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    { type: 'bpmn:Participant', order: { level: -2 } },
    { type: 'bpmn:Lane', order: { level: -1 } }
  ];
=======
    { type: 'bpmn:Participant', order: { level: -2 } },
    { type: 'bpmn:Lane', order: { level: -1 } },
    { type: 'bpmn:Group', order: { level: 10 } } // Add this line
  ];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds a new entry for `bpmn:Group` with a `level` of 10, ensuring that group elements are rendered on top of all other elements.
