The issue described is that the `AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior` is not applied after pasting elements onto flows. The label alignment is not updated correctly when elements are pasted onto a flow with a vertical direction.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the label positioning logic is correctly applied after pasting elements. The `getFlowLabelPosition` function seems to be responsible for calculating the label position based on the waypoints of the flow. However, it appears that the logic for determining the label position based on the angle of the flow might not be correctly handling vertical flows.

Here's a potential fix:

```javascript
### lib/util/LabelUtil.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (Math.abs(angle) < Math.PI / 2) {
    y -= FLOW_LABEL_INDENT;
  } else {
    x += FLOW_LABEL_INDENT;
  }
=======
  // Adjust label position based on flow direction
  if (Math.abs(angle) < Math.PI / 4) {
    // Horizontal flow
    y -= FLOW_LABEL_INDENT;
  } else if (Math.abs(angle) > Math.PI / 4 && Math.abs(angle) < 3 * Math.PI / 4) {
    // Vertical flow
    x += FLOW_LABEL_INDENT;
  } else {
    // Diagonal flow
    x += FLOW_LABEL_INDENT / 2;
    y -= FLOW_LABEL_INDENT / 2;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adjusts the label position based on the flow direction. For horizontal flows, it moves the label up. For vertical flows, it moves the label to the right. For diagonal flows, it moves the label both up and to the right. This should ensure that the label is correctly positioned after pasting elements onto flows with different directions.
