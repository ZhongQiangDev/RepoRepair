The issue described is that the `AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior` is not applied after pasting elements onto flows. The GIF shows that when a boundary event with a label is copied and pasted onto a flow with a vertical direction, the label's position does not adjust as expected.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior` is triggered after pasting elements. This can be achieved by adding a listener for the `element.paste` event and calling `checkLabelAdjustment` for the pasted elements.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  this.postExecuted([
    'label.create'
  ], function(event) {
    checkLabelAdjustment(event.context.shape.labelTarget);
  });
=======
  this.postExecuted([
    'label.create',
    'element.paste'
  ], function(event) {
    if (event.context.type === 'element.paste') {
      var pastedElements = event.context.elements;
      pastedElements.forEach(function(element) {
        checkLabelAdjustment(element);
      });
    } else {
      checkLabelAdjustment(event.context.shape.labelTarget);
    }
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when elements are pasted, the `checkLabelAdjustment` function is called for each pasted element, which should resolve the issue of the label not being aligned correctly after pasting.
