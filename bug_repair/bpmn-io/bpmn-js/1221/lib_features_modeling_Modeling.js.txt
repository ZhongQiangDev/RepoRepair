The issue described is that the `AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior` is not applied after pasting elements onto flows. This suggests that the label positioning logic is not being triggered or applied correctly during the paste operation.

To address this, we need to ensure that the label positioning behavior is invoked after the paste operation. This likely involves modifying the `Modeling` class to include a call to the label positioning logic after pasting elements.

Here's a potential fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Modeling.prototype.updateLabel = function(element, newLabel, newBounds, hints) {
  this._commandStack.execute('element.updateLabel', {
    element: element,
    newLabel: newLabel,
    newBounds: newBounds,
    hints: hints || {}
  });
};
=======
Modeling.prototype.updateLabel = function(element, newLabel, newBounds, hints) {
  this._commandStack.execute('element.updateLabel', {
    element: element,
    newLabel: newLabel,
    newBounds: newBounds,
    hints: hints || {}
  });

  // Ensure label positioning is applied after updating the label
  this._commandStack.execute('element.applyLabelPositioning', {
    element: element,
    hints: hints || {}
  });
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to ensure that the `applyLabelPositioning` command is defined and properly handles the label positioning logic. If this command does not exist, it should be added to the relevant command handlers.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Modeling.prototype.connect = function(source, target, attrs, hints) {
  var bpmnRules = this._bpmnRules;

  if (!attrs) {
    attrs = bpmnRules.canConnect(source, target);
  }

  if (!attrs) {
    return;
  }

  return this.createConnection(source, target, attrs, source.parent, hints);
};
=======
Modeling.prototype.connect = function(source, target, attrs, hints) {
  var bpmnRules = this._bpmnRules;

  if (!attrs) {
    attrs = bpmnRules.canConnect(source, target);
  }

  if (!attrs) {
    return;
  }

  var connection = this.createConnection(source, target, attrs, source.parent, hints);

  // Ensure label positioning is applied after creating the connection
  this._commandStack.execute('element.applyLabelPositioning', {
    element: connection,
    hints: hints || {}
  });

  return connection;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the label positioning behavior is applied after updating labels and creating connections, which should resolve the issue described.
