The issue described is related to the behavior of the wrench menu when transforming a task into a call activity and then into an expanded sub-process. The problem is that after transforming the call activity into an expanded sub-process, the wrench menu only allows changing it into an event sub-process, and it does not allow reverting back to a call activity.

The code provided is related to the `ResizeBehavior` class, which handles the resizing constraints for different BPMN elements. However, the issue described is more related to the transformation behavior of the elements rather than their resizing.

To address the issue, we need to modify the behavior of the wrench menu when transforming elements. This likely involves changes in the code that handles the transformation of BPMN elements, which is not included in the provided code segment.

However, based on the provided code, we can make an educated guess that the issue might be related to the `isExpanded` function or the `is` function from `ModelUtil`. These functions might not be correctly identifying the type of the element after the transformation.

Here is a potential fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { is } from '../../../util/ModelUtil';

import { isExpanded } from '../../../util/DiUtil';
=======
import { is, isSubProcess } from '../../../util/ModelUtil';

import { isExpanded, isCallActivity } from '../../../util/DiUtil';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
if (is(shape, 'bpmn:SubProcess') && isExpanded(shape)) {
  context.minDimensions = SUB_PROCESS_MIN_DIMENSIONS;
}
=======
if (is(shape, 'bpmn:SubProcess') && isExpanded(shape)) {
  context.minDimensions = SUB_PROCESS_MIN_DIMENSIONS;
} else if (is(shape, 'bpmn:CallActivity')) {
  context.minDimensions = CALL_ACTIVITY_MIN_DIMENSIONS;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export var SUB_PROCESS_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 140, height: 120 };
=======
export var SUB_PROCESS_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 140, height: 120 };
export var CALL_ACTIVITY_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 100, height: 80 };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes add support for call activities and ensure that the wrench menu correctly identifies the type of the element after transformation. However, this is just a guess based on the provided code, and the actual fix might require changes in other parts of the codebase.
