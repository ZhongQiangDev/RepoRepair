The issue described is that the snapping functionality for docking points is not working in `v4-beta` as it did in `v3.x`. The provided code snippet is from `BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js`, which is responsible for snapping during create and move operations. The issue seems to be related to the snapping logic for boundary events.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the snapping logic for boundary events is correctly implemented. The current code checks if the shape can be attached to the target and if it is not already snapped. If these conditions are met, it calls `snapBoundaryEvent` to perform the snapping. However, the `snapBoundaryEvent` function is not defined in the provided code.

We need to define the `snapBoundaryEvent` function to correctly snap the boundary event to the target. Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/snapping/BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function canAttach(shape, target, position) {
  return bpmnRules.canAttach([ shape ], target, null, position) === 'attach';
}

// snap boundary events
eventBus.on([
  'create.move',
  'create.end',
  'shape.move.move',
  'shape.move.end'
], HIGH_PRIORITY, function(event) {
  var context = event.context,
      target = context.target,
      shape = context.shape;

  if (target && canAttach(shape, target, event) && !isSnapped(event)) {
    snapBoundaryEvent(event, target);
  }
});
=======
function canAttach(shape, target, position) {
  return bpmnRules.canAttach([ shape ], target, null, position) === 'attach';
}

function snapBoundaryEvent(event, target) {
  var context = event.context,
      shape = context.shape,
      position = event.position;

  var attachment = getBoundaryAttachment(shape, target, position);

  if (attachment) {
    setSnapped(event, 'x', attachment.x);
    setSnapped(event, 'y', attachment.y);
  }
}

// snap boundary events
eventBus.on([
  'create.move',
  'create.end',
  'shape.move.move',
  'shape.move.end'
], HIGH_PRIORITY, function(event) {
  var context = event.context,
      target = context.target,
      shape = context.shape;

  if (target && canAttach(shape, target, event) && !isSnapped(event)) {
    snapBoundaryEvent(event, target);
  }
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix defines the `snapBoundaryEvent` function, which calculates the correct attachment point for the boundary event using `getBoundaryAttachment` and then sets the snapped position using `setSnapped`. This should restore the snapping functionality for boundary events in `v4-beta`.
