The issue described is that the docking snapping functionality, which worked in `v3.x`, is no longer functioning in `v4-beta`. The provided code segment is from `BpmnSnappingUtil.js`, which seems to be related to the snapping functionality. However, the code provided does not seem to directly address the snapping issue as described in the issue text.

The issue seems to be related to the snapping of connected elements on their docking points. The provided code segment is a utility function `getBoundaryAttachment` which calculates the orientation of a position relative to target bounds. This function might be used in the snapping logic, but it does not seem to be the direct cause of the snapping issue.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the snapping logic is correctly implemented in `v4-beta`. This might involve checking the snapping logic in other parts of the codebase, such as the snapping module or the layout module.

Since the provided code segment does not seem to be the direct cause of the issue, we cannot generate a *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit for this specific code segment. However, we can suggest a potential fix by adding a debug statement to the `getBoundaryAttachment` function to check if it is being called and what values it is returning.

```javascript
### lib/features/snapping/BpmnSnappingUtil.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function getBoundaryAttachment(position, targetBounds) {

  var orientation = getOrientation(position, targetBounds, -15);

  if (orientation !== 'intersect') {
    return orientation;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
=======
export function getBoundaryAttachment(position, targetBounds) {

  console.log('getBoundaryAttachment called with position:', position, 'and targetBounds:', targetBounds);

  var orientation = getOrientation(position, targetBounds, -15);

  console.log('orientation:', orientation);

  if (orientation !== 'intersect') {
    return orientation;
  } else {
    return null;
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This debug statement will help us understand if the `getBoundaryAttachment` function is being called and what values it is returning. This can help us identify if the issue is related to this function or if it is related to other parts of the codebase.
