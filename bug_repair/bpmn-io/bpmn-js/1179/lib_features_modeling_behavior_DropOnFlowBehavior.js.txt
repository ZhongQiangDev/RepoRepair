The issue described is that when an element is dropped onto a sequence flow, the layout breaks and the docking of the new incoming sequence flow is always at the top left corner. This suggests that the docking point calculation might be incorrect or not being applied properly.

The relevant code segment is the `insertShape` function, specifically where the docking point is calculated and applied. The docking point should be correctly calculated based on the intersection of the waypoints and the position where the element is dropped.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      dockingPoint = intersection.bendpoint ? waypoints[intersection.index] : position;

      // if last waypointBefore is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point
      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsBefore[waypointsBefore.length-1])) {
        waypointsBefore.push(copy(dockingPoint));
      }

      // if first waypointAfter is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point
      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsAfter[0])) {
        waypointsAfter.unshift(copy(dockingPoint));
      }
=======
      dockingPoint = intersection.bendpoint ? waypoints[intersection.index] : position;

      // Ensure docking point is correctly applied
      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsBefore[waypointsBefore.length-1])) {
        waypointsBefore.push({ x: dockingPoint.x, y: dockingPoint.y });
      }

      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsAfter[0])) {
        waypointsAfter.unshift({ x: dockingPoint.x, y: dockingPoint.y });
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the docking point is correctly applied by explicitly setting the `x` and `y` coordinates of the docking point when pushing it to the waypoints array. This should resolve the issue of the docking point always being at the top left corner.
