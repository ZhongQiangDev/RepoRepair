The issue described is related to connecting message flows to pool boundaries after a lane has been added and removed. The problem seems to be in the `canConnectMessageFlow` function, which checks if a message flow can be connected between two elements. The function checks if the target has a parent, which might not be the case when a lane is added and removed.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the target does not have a parent due to the lane being added and removed. We can modify the function to check if the target is a pool and if it has any lanes, and if so, allow the connection.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function canConnectMessageFlow(source, target) {

  // handle the case where target does not have a parent,
  // because it is not dropped within the diagram (bpmn-io/bpmn-js#1033)
  if (!target.parent) {
    return false;
  }

  return (
    isMessageFlowSource(source) &&
    isMessageFlowTarget(target) &&
    !isSameOrganization(source, target)
  );
}
=======
function canConnectMessageFlow(source, target) {

  // handle the case where target does not have a parent,
  // because it is not dropped within the diagram (bpmn-io/bpmn-js#1033)
  if (!target.parent) {
    const targetBusinessObject = getBusinessObject(target);
    if (is(targetBusinessObject, 'bpmn:Participant') && targetBusinessObject.lanes.length > 0) {
      return (
        isMessageFlowSource(source) &&
        isMessageFlowTarget(target) &&
        !isSameOrganization(source, target)
      );
    }
    return false;
  }

  return (
    isMessageFlowSource(source) &&
    isMessageFlowTarget(target) &&
    !isSameOrganization(source, target)
  );
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
