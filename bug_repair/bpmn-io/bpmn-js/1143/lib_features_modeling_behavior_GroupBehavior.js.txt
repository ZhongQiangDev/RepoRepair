The issue described in the bug report seems to be related to the handling of groups in an empty diagram, where adding a group and then attempting to add other elements causes the editor to crash with console errors. The error messages in the console suggest that there are issues with SVG transformations, specifically with non-finite values being passed to `setTranslate`.

The problem likely lies in the way the group is being created or managed within the `GroupBehavior` class. Specifically, the `execute` method for `shape.create` might not be properly initializing the group, leading to issues when other elements are added.

To address this, we need to ensure that the group is properly initialized and that its properties are correctly set up. Here's a potential fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/GroupBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * create new category + value when group was created
   */
  this.execute('shape.create', function(event) {

    var context = event.context,
        shape = context.shape,
        businessObject = getBusinessObject(shape),
        oldBusinessObject = shape.oldBusinessObject;

    if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:Group') && !businessObject.categoryValueRef) {

      var definitions = getDefinitions(),
          categoryValue = createCategoryValue(definitions, bpmnFactory);

      // set name from copied group if existing
      if (oldBusinessObject && oldBusinessObject.categoryValueRef) {
        categoryValue.value = oldBusinessObject.categoryValueRef.value;
      }

      // link the reference to the Group
      businessObject.categoryValueRef = categoryValue;

    }

  });

    if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:Group') && !businessObject.categoryValueRef) {

      var definitions = getDefinitions(),
          categoryValue = createCategoryValue(definitions, bpmnFactory);

      // set name from copied group if existing
      if (oldBusinessObject && oldBusinessObject.categoryValueRef) {
        categoryValue.value = oldBusinessObject.categoryValueRef.value;
      }

      // link the reference to the Group
      businessObject.categoryValueRef = categoryValue;

      // Ensure the group has valid dimensions
      if (!shape.width || !shape.height) {
        shape.width = 100;
        shape.height = 100;
      }

    }

  });

```

This fix ensures that the group has valid dimensions when it is created, which might help prevent the non-finite value errors seen in the console. If the issue persists, further investigation into the SVG transformation logic might be necessary.
