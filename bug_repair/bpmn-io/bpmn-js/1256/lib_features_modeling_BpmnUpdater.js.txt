The issue described is related to the deformation of the diagram when a child lane is removed from a parent lane. This deformation likely occurs due to incorrect handling of lane relationships and layout adjustments within the BPMN diagram.

To address this, we need to ensure that when a child lane is removed, the remaining lanes are properly repositioned and resized to maintain the integrity of the diagram layout. The `updateSemanticParent` method in `BpmnUpdater.js` is responsible for updating the parent-child relationships, but it may not be handling lane removals correctly.

Here's a potential fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:Lane')) {

    if (newParent) {
      newParent = this.getLaneSet(newParent);
    }

    containment = 'lanes';
  } else
=======
if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:Lane')) {

    if (newParent) {
      newParent = this.getLaneSet(newParent);
    }

    containment = 'lanes';

    // Ensure proper layout adjustment when removing a lane
    if (!newParent) {
      const laneSet = businessObject.$parent;
      if (laneSet && laneSet.lanes) {
        const remainingLanes = laneSet.lanes.filter(lane => lane !== businessObject);
        remainingLanes.forEach((lane, index) => {
          lane.x = index * lane.width;
        });
      }
    }
  } else
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures that when a lane is removed (`newParent` is `null`), the remaining lanes in the lane set are repositioned to fill the gap left by the removed lane. This should help prevent the deformation of the diagram and allow for continued editing.
