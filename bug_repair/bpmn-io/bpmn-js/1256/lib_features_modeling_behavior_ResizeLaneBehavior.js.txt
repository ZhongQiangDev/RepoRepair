The issue described is related to the deformation of the diagram when a child lane is removed from a parent lane. The provided code segment is responsible for handling the resizing behavior of lanes and participants. However, it does not directly address the removal of lanes. The deformation issue likely stems from how the lane removal is handled in the modeling logic, which is not shown in the provided code.

To address the issue, we need to ensure that when a child lane is removed, the remaining lanes and the overall diagram layout are adjusted correctly. This typically involves recalculating the positions and sizes of the remaining lanes to fill the space left by the removed lane.

Since the provided code does not include the lane removal logic, we need to infer the necessary changes. A common approach would be to add a method to handle lane removal and ensure that the layout is updated accordingly.

Here is a potential fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeLaneBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { is } from '../../../util/ModelUtil';

import {
  roundBounds
} from 'diagram-js/lib/layout/LayoutUtil';

import {
  hasPrimaryModifier
} from 'diagram-js/lib/util/Mouse';

var SLIGHTLY_HIGHER_PRIORITY = 1001;
=======
import { is } from '../../../util/ModelUtil';

import {
  roundBounds
} from 'diagram-js/lib/layout/LayoutUtil';

import {
  hasPrimaryModifier
} from 'diagram-js/lib/util/Mouse';

var SLIGHTLY_HIGHER_PRIORITY = 1001;

// Add method to handle lane removal and layout adjustment
function adjustLayoutAfterLaneRemoval(parentLane, removedLane, modeling) {
  const remainingLanes = parentLane.children.filter(child => child !== removedLane);
  const totalHeight = parentLane.height;
  const laneCount = remainingLanes.length;
  const laneHeight = totalHeight / laneCount;

  remainingLanes.forEach((lane, index) => {
    const newY = index * laneHeight;
    modeling.moveShape(lane, { x: 0, y: newY });
    modeling.resizeShape(lane, { width: lane.width, height: laneHeight });
  });
}

// Modify eventBus.on('resize.end') to include lane removal handling
eventBus.on('resize.end', SLIGHTLY_HIGHER_PRIORITY, function(event) {
  var context = event.context,
      shape = context.shape,
      canExecute = context.canExecute,
      newBounds = context.newBounds;

  if (is(shape, 'bpmn:Lane') || is(shape, 'bpmn:Participant')) {

    if (canExecute) {

      // ensure we have actual pixel values for new bounds
      // (important when zoom level was > 1 during move)
      newBounds = roundBounds(newBounds);

      // perform the actual resize
      modeling.resizeLane(shape, newBounds, context.balanced);

      // Check if a lane was removed and adjust layout if necessary
      if (context.removedLane) {
        adjustLayoutAfterLaneRemoval(shape.parent, context.removedLane, modeling);
      }
    }

    // stop propagation
    return false;
  }
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix introduces a new method `adjustLayoutAfterLaneRemoval` that recalculates the positions and sizes of the remaining lanes after a lane is removed. It also modifies the `resize.end` event handler to call this method if a lane was removed. Note that this is a simplified example and may need to be adapted based on the actual implementation details of the modeling logic.
