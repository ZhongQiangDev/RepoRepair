The issue described is related to the creation of groups inside collapsed sub-processes and the subsequent warning about unresolved references when re-importing the BPMN diagram. The problem seems to be related to how the `categoryValueRef` is handled when creating and deleting groups within sub-processes.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `categoryValueRef` is properly managed when creating and deleting groups within sub-processes. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `categoryValueRef` is correctly linked to the appropriate parent category when creating a group and properly removed when deleting a group.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/modeling/behavior/GroupBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * create new category + value when group was created
   */
  this.execute('shape.create', function(event) {
    var context = event.context,
        shape = context.shape,
        businessObject = getBusinessObject(shape);

    if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:Group') && !businessObject.categoryValueRef) {

      var definitions = getDefinitions(),
          categoryValue = createCategoryValue(definitions, bpmnFactory);

      // link the reference to the Group
      businessObject.categoryValueRef = categoryValue;
    }
  });

  /**
   * create new category + value when group was created
   */
  this.execute('shape.create', function(event) {
    var context = event.context,
        shape = context.shape,
        businessObject = getBusinessObject(shape);

    if (is(businessObject, 'bpmn:Group') && !businessObject.categoryValueRef) {

      var parentElement = shape.parent,
          parentBusinessObject = getBusinessObject(parentElement),
          categoryValue;

      if (is(parentBusinessObject, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
        // If the group is inside a sub-process, use the sub-process as the parent for the category
        categoryValue = createCategoryValue(parentBusinessObject, bpmnFactory);
      } else {
        // Otherwise, use the definitions as the parent for the category
        var definitions = getDefinitions();
        categoryValue = createCategoryValue(definitions, bpmnFactory);
      }

      // link the reference to the Group
      businessObject.categoryValueRef = categoryValue;
    }
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when a group is created inside a sub-process, the `categoryValue` is created with the sub-process as its parent, rather than the root definitions. This should prevent the unresolved reference warning when re-importing the BPMN diagram.
