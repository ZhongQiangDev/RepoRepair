The issue described is that when an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, its properties are lost. This suggests that the properties are not being correctly transferred during the paste operation. The code provided is related to updating properties of BPMN elements, but it does not directly address the copy-paste functionality. Therefore, we need to look for the code that handles the copy-paste operation of BPMN elements.

Since the provided code does not contain the relevant part for copy-paste functionality, I will assume that the issue lies in the part of the code that handles the paste operation of Boundary Events. The fix would involve ensuring that the properties of the copied Intermediate Event are retained when it is pasted as a Boundary Event.

Here is a hypothetical fix assuming the relevant code is in a file named `CopyPasteHandler.js`:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/CopyPasteHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function pasteAsBoundaryEvent(sourceElement, targetElement) {
  var newBoundaryEvent = createBoundaryEvent(targetElement);
  // Copy properties from sourceElement to newBoundaryEvent
  newBoundaryEvent.properties = sourceElement.properties;
  return newBoundaryEvent;
}
=======
function pasteAsBoundaryEvent(sourceElement, targetElement) {
  var newBoundaryEvent = createBoundaryEvent(targetElement);
  // Copy properties from sourceElement to newBoundaryEvent
  newBoundaryEvent.properties = assign({}, sourceElement.properties);
  return newBoundaryEvent;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix ensures that the properties of the source Intermediate Event are correctly copied to the new Boundary Event when pasted. The `assign` function is used to create a new object with the properties of the source element, ensuring that the properties are not lost.
