The issue described is that when an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, its properties are lost. This suggests that the properties of the original Intermediate Event are not being transferred to the new Boundary Event during the paste operation.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the properties of the original Intermediate Event are copied over to the new Boundary Event when it is created. This can be done by modifying the `CreateBoundaryEventBehavior` function to include the properties of the original event when creating the new Boundary Event.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (host && is(shape, 'bpmn:IntermediateThrowEvent')) {
      attrs.attachedToRef = host.businessObject;

      businessObject = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:BoundaryEvent', attrs);

      boundaryEvent = {
        type: 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent',
        businessObject: businessObject
      };

      context.shape = elementFactory.createShape(boundaryEvent);
=======
    if (host && is(shape, 'bpmn:IntermediateThrowEvent')) {
      // Copy properties from the original Intermediate Event
      const originalBusinessObject = shape.businessObject;
      const originalProperties = {
        ...originalBusinessObject.$attrs,
        attachedToRef: host.businessObject,
        cancelActivity: true
      };

      businessObject = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:BoundaryEvent', originalProperties);

      boundaryEvent = {
        type: 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent',
        businessObject: businessObject
      };

      context.shape = elementFactory.createShape(boundaryEvent);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that the properties of the original Intermediate Event are copied over to the new Boundary Event when it is created, thus preserving the properties during the paste operation.
