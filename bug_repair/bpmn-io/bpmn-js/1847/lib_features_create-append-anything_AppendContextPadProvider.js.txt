The issue described is that the append shortcut `a` does not work on elements where append actions are allowed in principle but no append actions are given. The current implementation checks if the popup menu is empty for the 'bpmn-append' action and only then provides the append menu entry. This check prevents the append shortcut from working in cases where append actions are allowed but not explicitly defined.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the append menu entry is always provided, regardless of whether the popup menu is empty or not. We can achieve this by removing the check for the popup menu being empty.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
###lib/features/create-append-anything/AppendContextPadProvider.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (!popupMenu.isEmpty(element, 'bpmn-append')) {
=======
  // Always provide the append menu entry
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit removes the condition that checks if the popup menu is empty, ensuring that the append menu entry is always provided.
