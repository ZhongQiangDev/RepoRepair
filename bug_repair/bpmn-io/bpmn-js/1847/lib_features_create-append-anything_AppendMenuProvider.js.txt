The issue described is that the append shortcut `a` does not work on elements where append actions are allowed in principle but no append actions are given. The expected behavior is that `a` should always be an available action, defaulting to create if append is not applicable.

The problem seems to be in the `getPopupMenuEntries` function where it returns an empty array `[]` when there are no append actions available. Instead, it should return a default create action when append actions are not available.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
###lib/features/create-append-anything/AppendMenuProvider.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (!rules.allowed('shape.append', { element: element })) {
    return [];
  }
=======
  if (!rules.allowed('shape.append', { element: element })) {
    return {
      'create-default': {
        label: translate('Create'),
        action: this._createEntryAction(element, null)
      }
    };
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when no append actions are available, a default create action is returned, allowing the `a` shortcut to work as expected.
