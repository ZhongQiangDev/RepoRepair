The issue described is related to the `setColor` function not setting the external label to the "stroke" color as expected. The provided code snippet does not contain the `setColor` function or any logic related to setting colors. However, based on the issue description, we can infer that the logic for setting the color of external labels needs to be adjusted.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that when the `setColor` function is called, it sets the external label's color to the "stroke" color instead of the "fill" color. Since the provided code snippet does not contain the `setColor` function, we will assume it exists in another file and modify it accordingly.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/lib/modeling/Modeling.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function setColor(element, color) {
  // existing logic to set color for the element
  if (element.label && hasExternalLabel(element)) {
    // existing logic to set color for the external label
    element.label.fill = color.fill;
  }
}
=======
function setColor(element, color) {
  // existing logic to set color for the element
  if (element.label && hasExternalLabel(element)) {
    // set the external label's color to the "stroke" color
    element.label.stroke = color.stroke;
  }
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix assumes that the `setColor` function exists in the `Modeling.js` file and that it checks if the element has an external label using the `hasExternalLabel` function. If the element has an external label, it sets the label's color to the "stroke" color instead of the "fill" color.
