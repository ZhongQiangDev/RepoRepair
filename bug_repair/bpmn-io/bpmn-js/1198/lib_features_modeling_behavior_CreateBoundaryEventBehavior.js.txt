The issue described is related to the removal of the `default` attribute from an exclusive gateway when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is added to a non-default flow. The provided code segment does not directly address this issue, as it is related to creating boundary events. However, the issue seems to be related to the modeling behavior when adding events to flows.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `default` attribute is preserved when adding a Timer Intermediate Catch Event or other types of catch events to a non-default flow. This likely requires a modification in the modeling behavior or command execution logic.

Since the provided code segment does not directly address the issue, we need to look for the relevant code that handles the addition of events to flows and ensures the preservation of the `default` attribute.

Assuming the relevant code is in a different file, let's create a hypothetical fix by adding a check to preserve the `default` attribute when adding events to flows.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/AddEventToFlowBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
this.preExecute('element.add', function(context) {
  var shape = context.shape,
      target = context.target,
      source = context.source,
      businessObject = shape.businessObject;

  // Add event to flow logic
  // ...
=======
this.preExecute('element.add', function(context) {
  var shape = context.shape,
      target = context.target,
      source = context.source,
      businessObject = shape.businessObject;

  // Check if the target is an exclusive gateway and has a default flow
  if (is(target, 'bpmn:ExclusiveGateway') && target.businessObject.default) {
    // Preserve the default attribute
    target.businessObject.default = target.businessObject.default;
  }

  // Add event to flow logic
  // ...
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This hypothetical fix adds a check to preserve the `default` attribute when adding events to flows. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific codebase and architecture of the BPMN modeler.
