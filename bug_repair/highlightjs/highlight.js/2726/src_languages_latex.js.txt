The issue described is that code inside braces `{}` in LaTeX is not being highlighted correctly. The current implementation treats the content inside braces as a single string literal, which prevents proper syntax highlighting. To fix this, we need to modify the `COMMAND` definition so that it correctly parses and highlights the content inside braces.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/latex.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            {
              className: 'string', // because it looks like attributes in HTML tags
              variants: [
                {begin: /\[/, end: /\]/},
                {begin: /\{/, end: /\}/}
              ]
            },
=======
            {
              className: 'string', // because it looks like attributes in HTML tags
              variants: [
                {begin: /\[/, end: /\]/},
                {
                  begin: /\{/,
                  end: /\}/,
                  contains: [COMMAND] // Allow nested commands inside braces
                }
              ]
            },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change allows the content inside braces to be parsed and highlighted as normal LaTeX code, including nested commands. This should resolve the issue where content inside braces is not highlighted correctly.
