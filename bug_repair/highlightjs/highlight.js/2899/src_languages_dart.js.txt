The issue described is that an empty block comment (`/**/`) breaks the syntax highlighting for the Dart code. The problem seems to be related to how the block comment is being handled in the Dart language definition.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the block comment mode correctly handles empty block comments without breaking the syntax highlighting.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/dart.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
=======
      {
        className: 'comment',
        begin: '/\\*',
        end: '\\*/',
        contains: [
          {
            begin: '\\*/',
            relevance: 0
          }
        ]
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the block comment mode to explicitly handle the end of the comment and ensures that an empty block comment (`/**/`) does not break the syntax highlighting. The `contains` array is used to handle the end of the comment without adding any additional relevance.
