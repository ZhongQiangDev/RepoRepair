The issue described is that the `if` and `else` blocks in Handlebars templates are not being highlighted correctly. The current regex patterns and modes in the Handlebars language definition do not properly handle the `else if` syntax, leading to incorrect highlighting.

To fix this, we need to adjust the regex patterns and modes to correctly identify and highlight the `else if` syntax. Specifically, we need to modify the `className: 'template-tag'` mode that matches the `else` keyword to also match `else if`.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/handlebars.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      {
        className: 'template-tag',
        begin: /\{\{(?=else\}\})/,
        end: /\}\}/,
        keywords: 'else'
      },
=======
      {
        className: 'template-tag',
        begin: /\{\{(?=(else|else if)\}\})/,
        end: /\}\}/,
        keywords: 'else else if'
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will allow the `else if` syntax to be correctly identified and highlighted as a `template-tag`. The `keywords` property is also updated to include `else if` so that it is highlighted as a keyword.
