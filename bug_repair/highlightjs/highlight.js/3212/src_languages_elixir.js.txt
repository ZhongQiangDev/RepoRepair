The issue is that the `0` on its own and `0` at the start of a decimal integer or float is not being highlighted as a number. This is due to the current regular expression used for matching numbers in the `NUMBER` constant.

To fix this, we need to modify the regular expression to include `0` as a valid number and ensure that `0` at the start of a decimal integer or float is also highlighted as a number.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/languages/elixir.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const NUMBER = {
      className: 'number',
      begin: '(\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\b[1-9][0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',
      relevance: 0
    };
=======
    const NUMBER = {
      className: 'number',
      begin: '(\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\b[0-9][0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',
      relevance: 0
    };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
- The original regular expression `(-?\\b[1-9][0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)` only matches numbers starting with `1-9`.
- The modified regular expression `(-?\\b[0-9][0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)` includes `0` as a valid starting digit for numbers.
- This change ensures that `0` on its own and `0` at the start of a decimal integer or float will be highlighted as a number.
