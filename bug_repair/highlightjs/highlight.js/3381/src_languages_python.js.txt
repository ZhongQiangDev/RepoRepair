The issue described is that the Python identifier `_undef` is being incorrectly highlighted as a keyword because the substring `def` is being matched as the `def` keyword. This is likely due to the way the keyword matching is implemented in the Python language definition.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the keyword matching is done on whole words only, and not on substrings within identifiers. This can be achieved by modifying the `$pattern` in the `KEYWORDS` object to ensure it matches whole words only.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/python.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const KEYWORDS = {
      $pattern: /[A-Za-z]\w+|__\w+__/,
      keyword: RESERVED_WORDS,
      built_in: BUILT_INS,
      literal: LITERALS,
      type: TYPES
    };
=======
    const KEYWORDS = {
      $pattern: /\b[A-Za-z]\w*\b|\b__\w+__\b/,
      keyword: RESERVED_WORDS,
      built_in: BUILT_INS,
      literal: LITERALS,
      type: TYPES
    };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
- The original `$pattern` `[A-Za-z]\w+|__\w+__` matches any sequence of characters starting with a letter and followed by word characters, or any sequence starting and ending with double underscores.
- The modified `$pattern` `\b[A-Za-z]\w*\b|\b__\w+__\b` ensures that the matches are whole words by using word boundaries (`\b`). This prevents partial matches within identifiers.

This change should resolve the issue where parts of identifiers are incorrectly highlighted as keywords.
