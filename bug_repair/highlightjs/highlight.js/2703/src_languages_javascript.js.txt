The issue described in the provided text is that comments inside function parameters are not being highlighted correctly. This is likely due to the `PARAMS` definition not properly handling comments within the parameter list.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `PARAMS_CONTAINS` includes the comment modes (`hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE` and `hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE`) so that comments within the parameter list are recognized and highlighted.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/javascript.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    var PARAMS_CONTAINS = SUBST.contains.concat([
      // eat recursive parens in sub expressions
      { begin: /\(/, end: /\)/,
        contains: ["self"].concat(SUBST.contains, [hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE, hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE])
      },
      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE
    ]);
=======
    var PARAMS_CONTAINS = SUBST.contains.concat([
      // eat recursive parens in sub expressions
      { begin: /\(/, end: /\)/,
        contains: ["self"].concat(SUBST.contains, [hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE, hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE])
      },
      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.COMMENT(
        '//',
        '$',
        {
          contains: []
        }
      ),
      hljs.COMMENT(
        '/\\*',
        '\\*/',
        {
          contains: []
        }
      )
    ]);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification ensures that both line comments (`//`) and block comments (`/* */`) are included in the `PARAMS_CONTAINS` array, which should resolve the issue of comments not being highlighted within function parameters.
