The issue described is that the `Operators.(*)` function is being incorrectly interpreted as the start of a multi-line comment in F# code. This is likely due to the regex pattern used for detecting multi-line comments in the `hljs.COMMENT` function.

To fix this, we need to adjust the regex pattern for multi-line comments so that it doesn't mistakenly match the `Operators.(*)` function.

```javascript
### src/languages/fsharp.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      hljs.COMMENT('\\(\\*', '\\*\\)'),
=======
      hljs.COMMENT('\\(\\*\\s+', '\\s*\\*\\)'),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the regex pattern for multi-line comments. The original pattern `'\(\\*'` matches any `(*` sequence, which causes the issue. The new pattern `'\(\\*\\s+'` ensures that the `(*` is followed by at least one whitespace character, which should prevent the `Operators.(*)` function from being incorrectly matched as a comment. Similarly, the end pattern `'\s*\\*\\)'` allows for optional whitespace before the `*)` that ends the comment.
