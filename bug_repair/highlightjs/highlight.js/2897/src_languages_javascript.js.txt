The issue described is that an empty block comment (`/**/`) breaks further syntax highlighting in JavaScript code. The provided code sample `/**/console.log("Hello, World!")/**/` is not being highlighted correctly.

The problem seems to be related to how the comment rules are defined in the JavaScript language definition. Specifically, the `COMMENT` rule might not be handling empty block comments properly.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `COMMENT` rule correctly handles empty block comments without breaking the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/javascript.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const COMMENT = {
    className: "comment",
    variants: [
      JSDOC_COMMENT,
      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE
    ]
};
=======
const COMMENT = {
    className: "comment",
    variants: [
      JSDOC_COMMENT,
      {
        begin: '/\\*',
        end: '\\*/',
        relevance: 0,
        contains: []
      },
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE
    ]
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
1. The `hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE` is replaced with a custom block comment rule that explicitly defines the `begin` and `end` patterns for block comments.
2. This custom rule ensures that even empty block comments (`/**/`) are correctly matched and handled without breaking the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code.
3. The `relevance: 0` ensures that this rule does not add unnecessary relevance to the highlighting, which could affect other parts of the code.

This change should resolve the issue with empty block comments breaking the syntax highlighting in JavaScript code.
