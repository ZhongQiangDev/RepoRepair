The issue is that the multi-line comments in CMake (`#[[ ... ]]`) are not being recognized correctly by the highlight.js library. To fix this, we need to add a new rule to the `contains` array in the `cmake.js` file that matches the multi-line comment syntax.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/languages/cmake.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    contains: [
      {
        className: 'variable',
        begin: /\$\{/,
        end: /\}/
      },
      hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.QUOTE_STRING_MODE,
      hljs.NUMBER_MODE
    ]
=======
    contains: [
      {
        className: 'variable',
        begin: /\$\{/,
        end: /\}/
      },
      hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.QUOTE_STRING_MODE,
      hljs.NUMBER_MODE,
      {
        className: 'comment',
        begin: /\#\[\[/,
        end: /\]\]/
      }
    ]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds a new rule to the `contains` array that matches the multi-line comment syntax in CMake. The `className` is set to `'comment'` to indicate that this is a comment, and the `begin` and `end` properties are set to match the `#[[` and `]]` delimiters, respectively. This should correctly highlight multi-line comments in CMake code.
