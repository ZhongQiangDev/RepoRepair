The issue is that the `bash` language definition in the `bash.js` file does not include rules for highlighting specific characters such as `|`, `\`, `>`, `<`, `<<`, `<<<`, and `$(...)`. To fix this, we need to add these rules to the `contains` array of the `bash` language definition.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to add the missing rules:

```javascript
### src/languages/bash.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    contains: [
      KNOWN_SHEBANG, // to catch known shells and boost relevancy
      hljs.SHEBANG(), // to catch unknown shells but still highlight the shebang
      FUNCTION,
      ARITHMETIC,
      hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE,
      QUOTE_STRING,
      ESCAPED_QUOTE,
      APOS_STRING,
      VAR
    ]
=======
    contains: [
      KNOWN_SHEBANG, // to catch known shells and boost relevancy
      hljs.SHEBANG(), // to catch unknown shells but still highlight the shebang
      FUNCTION,
      ARITHMETIC,
      hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE,
      QUOTE_STRING,
      ESCAPED_QUOTE,
      APOS_STRING,
      VAR,
      {
        className: 'symbol',
        begin: /\||\\|>|<|<<|<<<|\$\(|\)/
      }
    ]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This edit adds a new rule to the `contains` array that matches the specific characters mentioned in the issue and highlights them with the `symbol` class.
