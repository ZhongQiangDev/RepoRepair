The issue described is that the CSS highlighter incorrectly highlights the closing parenthesis `)` within a string as the end of the string, which causes incorrect highlighting. The problem is in the regex used to define the string mode within the `url` or `data-uri` functions.

To fix this, we need to adjust the regex for the string mode within the `url` or `data-uri` functions so that it correctly handles parentheses within the string.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/languages/css.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
              {
                className: "string",
                // any character other than `)` as in `url()` will be the start
                // of a string, which ends with `)` (from the parent mode)
                begin: /[^)]/,
                endsWithParent: true,
                excludeEnd: true
              }
=======
              {
                className: "string",
                // Adjust the regex to correctly handle parentheses within the string
                begin: /[^)]*(?:\([^)]*\)[^)]*)*/,
                endsWithParent: true,
                excludeEnd: true
              }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the `begin` regex to allow for parentheses within the string by using a non-capturing group `(?:\([^)]*\))` that matches any parentheses and their contents, ensuring that the string mode correctly handles nested parentheses.
