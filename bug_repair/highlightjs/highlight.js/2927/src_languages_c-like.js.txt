The issue described is that the `LL` suffix in C/C++ integer literals is not fully highlighted, with only the first `L` being highlighted. This suggests that the regular expression used to match the `LL` suffix is not capturing both `L`s correctly.

To fix this, we need to update the regular expression in the `NUMBERS` section of the `c-like.js` file to ensure that both `L`s in the `LL` suffix are highlighted.

Here's the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the issue:

```javascript
### src/languages/c-like.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      {
        begin: '(-?)\\b([\\d\']+(\\.[\\d\']*)?|\\.[\\d\']+)(u|U|l|L|ul|UL|f|F|b|B)'
      },
=======
      {
        begin: '(-?)\\b([\\d\']+(\\.[\\d\']*)?|\\.[\\d\']+)(u|U|l|L|ul|UL|ll|LL|f|F|b|B)'
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the regular expression to include `ll` and `LL` as valid suffixes, ensuring that both `L`s in the `LL` suffix are highlighted correctly.
