The issue described is related to the highlighting of SQL code with escape sequences in strings. The current implementation of the SQL language definition in `highlight.js` does not properly handle escape sequences within strings, causing the highlighting to break.

To fix this, we need to modify the string definition in the SQL language definition to properly handle escape sequences. Specifically, we need to add a rule to handle escape sequences within single-quoted strings.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/sql.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
          {
            className: 'string',
            begin: '\'', end: '\'',
            contains: [{begin: '\'\''}]
          },
=======
          {
            className: 'string',
            begin: '\'', end: '\'',
            contains: [
              {begin: '\'\''},
              {begin: '\\.', relevance: 0} // Add this line to handle escape sequences
            ]
          },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new rule within the string definition to handle escape sequences (e.g., `\'`, `\\`, etc.) by matching any backslash followed by any character. The `relevance: 0` ensures that these escape sequences do not increase the relevance score, which helps in avoiding false positives.

This should resolve the issue with the highlighting breaking on quote escape sequences in SQL code.
