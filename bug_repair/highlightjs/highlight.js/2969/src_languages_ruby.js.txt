The issue described is related to the highlighting of character literals in Ruby code. The current implementation of the Ruby language definition in the `highlight.js` library does not correctly handle certain character literals, such as `?/`, `?\\`, `?„ÅÇ`, `?\u{1AF9}`, and `?\C-a`.

To fix this, we need to update the `STRING` definition in the `ruby.js` file to correctly recognize these character literals.

```javascript
### src/languages/ruby.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        begin: /\B\?(\\\d{1,3}|\\x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2}|\\u[A-Fa-f0-9]{4}|\\?\S)\b/
=======
        begin: /\B\?(\\\d{1,3}|\\x[A-Fa-f0-9]{1,2}|\\u\{[A-Fa-f0-9]+\}|\\u[A-Fa-f0-9]{4}|\\[CM]-?\\?|\\?\S)\b/
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the regular expression to include the missing cases:

- `\\u\{[A-Fa-f0-9]+\}`: Matches Unicode characters using curly-bracket notation.
- `\\[CM]-?\\?`: Matches control and meta characters.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the single slash character `?/` is not treated as the start of a regex. This can be handled by adjusting the `regexp` container to exclude the `?/` case:

```javascript
### src/languages/ruby.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        {
          className: 'regexp',
          contains: [
            hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,
            SUBST
          ],
          illegal: /\n/,
          variants: [
            {
              begin: '/',
              end: '/[a-z]*'
            },
            {
              begin: /%r\{/,
              end: /\}[a-z]*/
            },
            {
              begin: '%r\\(',
              end: '\\)[a-z]*'
            },
            {
              begin: '%r!',
              end: '![a-z]*'
            },
            {
              begin: '%r\\[',
              end: '\\][a-z]*'
            }
          ]
        }
=======
        {
          className: 'regexp',
          contains: [
            hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,
            SUBST
          ],
          illegal: /\n/,
          variants: [
            {
              begin: '(?!\\?)/',
              end: '/[a-z]*'
            },
            {
              begin: /%r\{/,
              end: /\}[a-z]*/
            },
            {
              begin: '%r\\(',
              end: '\\)[a-z]*'
            },
            {
              begin: '%r!',
              end: '![a-z]*'
            },
            {
              begin: '%r\\[',
              end: '\\][a-z]*'
            }
          ]
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `?/` character literal is not incorrectly treated as the start of a regex.
