The issue described is related to the incorrect handling of trailing escaped backslashes in `.properties` files. The current implementation does not correctly handle cases where the last character is an escaped backslash (`\\`), which can cause issues with multi-line values.

To fix this, we need to adjust the regular expression that matches the end of the string value to properly handle escaped backslashes. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `end` pattern for the string value correctly accounts for escaped backslashes at the end of the line.

Here is the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/properties.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
          className: 'string',
          end: /$/,
          relevance: 0,
          contains: [
            { begin: '\\\\\\n' }
          ]
=======
          className: 'string',
          end: /(?<!\\\\)(?:\\\\\\\\)*$/,
          relevance: 0,
          contains: [
            { begin: '\\\\\\n' }
          ]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Explanation:
- The original `end: /$/` matches the end of the line, but it does not account for escaped backslashes.
- The new `end: /(?<!\\\\)(?:\\\\\\\\)*/$` uses a negative lookbehind `(?<!\\\\)` to ensure that the end of the line is not preceded by an odd number of backslashes. This allows for the correct handling of escaped backslashes at the end of the line.
- The `(?:\\\\\\\\)*` part matches any even number of backslashes at the end of the line, ensuring that the string value is correctly terminated.

This change should resolve the issue with trailing escaped backslashes in `.properties` files.
