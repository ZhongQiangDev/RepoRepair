The issue seems to be related to the rendering of C++ code, specifically with the `Eigen` library syntax. The problem might be due to the way the `highlight.js` library is handling the `Eigen` library syntax. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `Eigen` library syntax is properly recognized by the `highlight.js` library.

Here's a potential fix:

1. Add a new rule to the `CPP_KEYWORDS` object to recognize `Eigen` as a keyword.
2. Ensure that the `Eigen` library syntax is properly handled in the `FUNCTION_DECLARATION` and `EXPRESSION_CONTAINS` rules.

```javascript
### src/languages/cpp.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const CPP_KEYWORDS = {
    type: RESERVED_TYPES,
    keyword: RESERVED_KEYWORDS,
    literal: LITERALS,
    built_in: BUILT_IN,
    _type_hints: TYPE_HINTS
};
=======
const CPP_KEYWORDS = {
    type: RESERVED_TYPES,
    keyword: RESERVED_KEYWORDS.concat(['Eigen']), // Add Eigen as a keyword
    literal: LITERALS,
    built_in: BUILT_IN,
    _type_hints: TYPE_HINTS
};

// Add a new rule to handle Eigen library syntax
const EIGEN_EXPRESSION = {
    className: 'expression',
    begin: /Eigen::/,
    keywords: CPP_KEYWORDS,
    contains: [
        C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE,
        hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
        STRINGS,
        NUMBERS,
        CPP_PRIMITIVE_TYPES
    ]
};

// Update EXPRESSION_CONTAINS to include the new rule
const EXPRESSION_CONTAINS = [
    FUNCTION_DISPATCH,
    PREPROCESSOR,
    CPP_PRIMITIVE_TYPES,
    C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE,
    hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
    NUMBERS,
    STRINGS,
    EIGEN_EXPRESSION // Add the new rule
];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change should help the `highlight.js` library recognize and properly render the `Eigen` library syntax in the C++ code.
