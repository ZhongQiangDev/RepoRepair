The issue described is that the `switch` statement is not highlighted correctly in the C++ language definition starting from version 10.7.0. The problem seems to be related to how the `switch` keyword is being matched and highlighted compared to other control flow keywords like `if`, `while`, and `for`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `switch` keyword is treated similarly to other control flow keywords in the language definition. Specifically, we should check if the `switch` keyword is being handled correctly within the `EXPRESSION_CONTEXT` or other relevant sections.

Here's the proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/cpp.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const EXPRESSION_CONTEXT = {
      // This mode covers expression context where we can't expect a function
      // definition and shouldn't highlight anything that looks like one:
      // `return some()`, `else if()`, `(x*sum(1, 2))`
      variants: [
        {
          begin: /=/,
          end: /;/
        },
        {
          begin: /\(/,
          end: /\)/
        },
        {
          beginKeywords: 'new throw return else',
          end: /;/
        }
      ],
      keywords: CPP_KEYWORDS,
      contains: EXPRESSION_CONTAINS.concat([
        {
          begin: /\(/,
          end: /\)/,
          keywords: CPP_KEYWORDS,
          contains: EXPRESSION_CONTAINS.concat([ 'self' ]),
          relevance: 0
        }
      ]),
      relevance: 0
    };
=======
    const EXPRESSION_CONTEXT = {
      // This mode covers expression context where we can't expect a function
      // definition and shouldn't highlight anything that looks like one:
      // `return some()`, `else if()`, `(x*sum(1, 2))`
      variants: [
        {
          begin: /=/,
          end: /;/
        },
        {
          begin: /\(/,
          end: /\)/
        },
        {
          beginKeywords: 'new throw return else switch',
          end: /;/
        }
      ],
      keywords: CPP_KEYWORDS,
      contains: EXPRESSION_CONTAINS.concat([
        {
          begin: /\(/,
          end: /\)/,
          keywords: CPP_KEYWORDS,
          contains: EXPRESSION_CONTAINS.concat([ 'self' ]),
          relevance: 0
        }
      ]),
      relevance: 0
    };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `switch` keyword is included in the `beginKeywords` list within the `EXPRESSION_CONTEXT`, which should help in highlighting it correctly along with other control flow keywords.
