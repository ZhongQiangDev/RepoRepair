### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when sorting a column in a data table, items are not reordered as expected if an item in the table has the property set to `null` or `undefined`. Specifically, the sorting mechanism fails to handle `null` or `undefined` values correctly, leading to unexpected sorting results.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the sorting logic not properly handling `null` or `undefined` values. When comparing values during sorting, if a value is `null` or `undefined`, it may cause the comparison to fail or produce incorrect results. The expected behavior is that `null` or `undefined` values should be treated as empty strings or handled in a way that does not disrupt the sorting order.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js ---
```
src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js
function: function_9
```

The `function_9` function in `buildState.js` filters and sorts data based on provided filters and sorting criteria, which is relevant to the cause.

#### --- src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
function: function_9
```
The `function_9` function handles sorting and filtering of the data. It includes sorting logic that may need to be adjusted to handle `null` or `undefined` values correctly.
