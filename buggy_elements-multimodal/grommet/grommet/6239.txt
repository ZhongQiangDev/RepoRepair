### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the tab underlines (margin bottom) do not stick to the bottom of the tab when there is scrollable content within the tab. This issue is observed after the introduction of a new feature in the `grommet` library (pull request #6137). The expected behavior is for the tab underlines to remain at the bottom of the tab, even when the content is scrollable.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from changes in the CSS styling or layout logic introduced in the new feature. Specifically, the new feature may have altered how the tab underlines are positioned relative to the tab content. This could involve changes in the flexbox layout, margin settings, or other CSS properties that affect the positioning of the tab underlines.
