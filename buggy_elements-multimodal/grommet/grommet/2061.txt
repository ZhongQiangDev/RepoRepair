### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the search input within the `Select` component appears very small in Safari, despite having padding applied. The issue is specifically related to the styling of the `<input type='search' />` element, where the padding is ignored in Safari, leading to a smaller input field compared to other browsers like Chrome.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to Safari's default styling of the `<input type='search' />` element. Safari applies its own styles to this element, which can override custom padding and other styles unless specific CSS rules are applied to counteract this behavior. The solution mentioned in the problem description (`-webkit-appearance: textfield;`) is a known workaround to reset Safari's default styling and allow custom styles like padding to be applied correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Select/Select.js`
This file contains the main `Select` component. The issue is related to the styling of the search input, so we need to look for functions that handle styling or rendering of the input.

```
src/js/components/Select/Select.js
function: function_5
```

`function_5` is the main function that renders the `Select` component. It likely contains the JSX that renders the `<input type='search' />` element. This function should be inspected to ensure the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` style is applied to the input.

#### `src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js`
This file contains functions related to the `SelectContainer` component, which is likely a child or wrapper component of the `Select` component. However, none of the functions listed here directly relate to the styling of the search input.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/TextInput/StyledTextInput.js`
This file contains functions related to the `StyledTextInput` component, which is likely used for styling text inputs. The issue might be related to the styling of the search input, so we should check if any of these functions apply styles to the input.

```
src/js/components/TextInput/StyledTextInput.js
function: function_5
```

`function_5` is a conditional styling rule that checks for focus styles. It might be relevant if the focus styles are affecting the appearance of the search input.

#### `src/js/components/TextInput/TextInput.js`
This file contains functions related to the `TextInput` component, which is likely used for rendering and managing text inputs. The issue might be related to the rendering or styling of the search input, so we should check if any of these functions apply styles to the input.

```
src/js/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
function: function_4
```

`function_4` is the main function that renders the `TextInput` component. It likely contains the JSX that renders the `<input type='search' />` element. This function should be inspected to ensure the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` style is applied to the input.

#### `src/js/utils/styles.js`
This file contains utility functions for generating styles. The issue might be related to the styling of the search input, so we should check if any of these functions apply styles to the input.

```
src/js/utils/styles.js
function: function_25
```

`function_25` is a function that calculates padding for input elements. It might be relevant if the padding calculation is affecting the appearance of the search input.
