### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `RangeInput` within the `FormField` is not centered and extends beyond the edge of the `FormField`. This misalignment causes the `RangeInput` to appear off-center and visually inconsistent with the expected design.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from incorrect styling or layout properties applied to the `RangeInput` or `FormField`. Possible causes include:
- Incorrect padding or margin settings in the `FormField` or `RangeInput`.
- Misalignment of the `RangeInput` within the `FormField` container.
- Theme-specific styles that are not properly applied or overridden.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js`
```
src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js
function: function_12
function: function_13
```
- `function_12` and `function_13` are responsible for rendering the `FormField` and managing its children, including the `RangeInput`. They handle padding, margins, and other styling properties that could affect the alignment of the `RangeInput`.

#### `src/js/components/RangeInput/RangeInput.js`
```
src/js/components/RangeInput/RangeInput.js
function: function_1
```
- `function_1` is the main `RangeInput` component. It manages the rendering of the range input and its interaction with the `FormField`. Issues with alignment or styling could originate here.

#### `src/js/components/RangeInput/StyledRangeInput.js`
```
src/js/components/RangeInput/StyledRangeInput.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_6
function: function_23
```
- `function_1` and `function_2` handle theme-based styling for the `RangeInput`, including opacity and color settings that could affect visual alignment.
- `function_6` sets the height of the range input track, which could influence the overall layout.
- `function_23` calculates a negative margin-top value, which might be affecting the vertical alignment of the `RangeInput`.

#### `src/js/utils/styles.js`
```
src/js/utils/styles.js
function: function_13
function: function_25
function: function_33
```
- `function_13` generates `align-self` styles, which could be relevant for aligning the `RangeInput` within the `FormField`.
- `function_25` handles padding styles, which might be affecting the layout.
- `function_33` applies margin styles, which could be relevant for the alignment issue.

#### `src/js/components/FormField/index.d.ts`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

- This file is a TypeScript definition file and does not contain any implementation details that could cause the described issue.
