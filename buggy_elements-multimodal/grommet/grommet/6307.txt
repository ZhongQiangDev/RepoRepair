### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using browser navigation (back/forward buttons), the URL changes, but the sorting arrow icons in the table headers do not update to reflect the new sorting state stored in the URL. This inconsistency between the URL and the table header state leads to a mismatch in the user interface.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the component responsible for rendering the table headers and sorting icons is not re-rendering or updating its state when the URL changes due to browser navigation. This could be due to a lack of a listener or observer for URL changes, or the component may not be properly connected to the URL state.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/Body.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
function: function_3
```

The `function_3` component is responsible for managing the overall state of the DataTable, including sorting. It likely needs to listen for URL changes and update the sorting state accordingly.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js
function: function_5
```

The `function_5` component renders the header row of the data table and handles sorting. It needs to ensure that the sorting icons are updated when the URL changes.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` component is responsible for rendering the column headers with sorting functionality. It should be updated to reflect the current sorting state from the URL.

#### `src/js/utils/DOM.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
