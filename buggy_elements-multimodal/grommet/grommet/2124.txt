### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the Calendar component does not display properly in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). The screenshot shows that the calendar is not rendering correctly, with some days missing or improperly aligned.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue is likely related to CSS compatibility or JavaScript functionality that is not supported in IE11. Common causes include:
- Flexbox or grid layout properties that are not fully supported in IE11.
- JavaScript features or polyfills that are missing or not functioning correctly in IE11.
- CSS-in-JS libraries that generate styles that are not compatible with IE11.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js`
```
src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js
function: function_13
```
The `function_13` is the main Calendar component. It is responsible for rendering the calendar and managing its state. If there are issues with the layout or rendering, this function could be the source of the problem.

#### `src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js`
```
src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js
function: function_1
function: function_14
function: function_15
function: function_16
function: function_17
```
These functions are responsible for generating dynamic styles for the calendar. If the styles generated by these functions are not compatible with IE11, it could cause the calendar to display incorrectly.

#### `src/js/components/Calendar/utils.js`
```
src/js/components/Calendar/utils.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
function: function_5
function: function_6
function: function_7
```
These utility functions handle date calculations and formatting. If there are issues with date handling in IE11, it could affect the calendar's display.

#### `src/js/components/Grid/StyledGrid.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
