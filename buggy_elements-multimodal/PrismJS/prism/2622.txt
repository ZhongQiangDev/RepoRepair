### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the goal is to add support for the Apex language in Prism.js. The issue arises because Apex is very similar to Java, and the current approach of creating a new language definition for Apex seems redundant. The provided code snippet suggests that simply aliasing Apex to Java might be sufficient, but the question is whether this is the best approach or if a more tailored solution is necessary.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The core issue is determining the most efficient and effective way to support Apex in Prism.js. The cause of the "wrong behavior" is the uncertainty about whether to:

- Create a new language definition for Apex, which might be overkill given its similarity to Java.
- Simply alias Apex to Java, which might not fully capture any unique syntax or features specific to Apex.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- prism.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-java.js ---
```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains the function `function_1`, which defines the syntax highlighting rules for the Java language. Since Apex is similar to Java, this function is relevant for understanding how Java is currently handled and for potentially extending or aliasing it for Apex.

#### --- plugins/show-language/prism-show-language.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```

### Conclusion

The primary relevant function is `function_1` in `components/prism-java.js`, which defines the Java language rules. To support Apex, you could either:

1. **Alias Apex to Java**: Modify this function to include Apex as an alias for Java.
2. **Extend Java for Apex**: If there are unique features in Apex, extend the Java rules to accommodate them.

Given the similarity between Apex and Java, the aliasing approach might be sufficient unless specific Apex features require additional handling.
