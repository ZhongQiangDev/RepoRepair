### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that single-package package names (e.g., `package baz;`) are not being highlighted correctly in Java code. The screenshot shows that `package baz;` is not highlighted, while `package baz.zap;` and `import` statements are highlighted correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the Java language definition in Prism.js is set up. Specifically, the regular expression patterns used to match and highlight package declarations may not be correctly configured to handle single-package names. The `namespace` pattern in the `prism-java.js` file is responsible for matching package declarations, and it may not be capturing single-package names as expected.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-java.js ---
```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `prism-java.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for the Java language. The issue likely lies within the `namespace` pattern, which is supposed to match package declarations. The pattern may need to be adjusted to correctly handle single-package names.
