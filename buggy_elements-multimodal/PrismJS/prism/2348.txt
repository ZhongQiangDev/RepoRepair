### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that PrismJS fails to highlight class names in C++ code correctly. Specifically:
- In the line `class MainWindow : public QMainWindow`, `QMainWindow` is not highlighted as a class name.
- In the line `void MainWindow::changeWindowTitle()`, `MainWindow` is not highlighted as a class name.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the C++ grammar definition in PrismJS. The grammar rules for identifying class names in C++ might not be comprehensive enough to cover these specific cases. The grammar rules need to be adjusted to recognize class names in inheritance declarations and method definitions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of PrismJS, including language management and highlighting logic. However, it does not contain specific language definitions or grammar rules for C++. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### -- Function `addInlined` --
This function is related to handling inlined languages within markup tags, such as CSS inside `<style>` tags. It is not relevant to the C++ grammar rules.
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### -- Function `function_1` --
This function initializes and configures the Prism object, including utilities and core highlighting functions. It does not contain specific language definitions or grammar rules for C++.
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### -- `function_26` --
This function is a hook for handling HTML entities and is not related to C++ grammar rules.
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### -- `function_28` --
This function defines the grammar for CSS and is not related to C++ grammar rules.
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### -- `function_29` --
This function handles loading and highlighting code from external files and is not related to C++ grammar rules.
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Conclusion

None of the provided functions or classes directly relate to the C++ grammar rules that need to be adjusted. The relevant code would likely be found in the C++ language definition file, which is not included in the provided information. To fix the issue, you would need to locate and modify the C++ grammar rules within PrismJS to correctly identify and highlight class names in the specified contexts.
