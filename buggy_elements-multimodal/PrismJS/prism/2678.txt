### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the Markdown syntax highlighting does not currently support images. Specifically, the image syntax `![emoji](https://content.markdowner.net/emoji/g/64/1f44d.png)` is not being recognized or rendered correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a grammar rule in the Prism.js Markdown language definition that recognizes and processes the image syntax. Without this rule, Prism.js does not know how to tokenize and highlight the image syntax, resulting in it being treated as plain text.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-markdown.js ---
```
components/prism-markdown.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `components/prism-markdown.js` is likely responsible for defining the Markdown grammar rules. To support image syntax, a new rule needs to be added to this function that matches the image syntax pattern `![alt text](image_url)`.

#### --- plugins/autoloader/prism-autoloader.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
