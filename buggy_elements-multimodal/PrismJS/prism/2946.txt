### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in reStructuredText (reST), the link element (`ALTER ROLE <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-alterrole.html>`_) and verbatim elements (``ALTER_ROLE``) are not being properly detected and highlighted. Instead, the entire text is being rendered as italicized, indicating that the syntax highlighting is not correctly identifying these elements. However, when the text is split into two lines, it renders correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the way the reST grammar is defined within Prism.js. The grammar rules for reST may not be correctly identifying the link and verbatim elements when they are on the same line. This could be due to the regex patterns used for matching these elements not being greedy enough or not accounting for the specific structure of the reST syntax when elements are combined on a single line.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### Relevant Files Information

The relevant file information provided does not include the specific reST grammar definition or any functions directly related to handling reST syntax. Therefore, we need to infer the relevant functions based on the general structure of Prism.js and the problem description.

### Relevant Functions/Classes

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1

prism.js
function: function_34
```

#### Explanation:

1. **`components/prism-core.js` - `function_1`**:
   - This function is the core `highlight` function in Prism.js. It processes the tokens and converts them into HTML with appropriate CSS classes for styling. If the reST grammar is not correctly identifying the link and verbatim elements, the `highlight` function would be involved in rendering the incorrect output.

2. **`prism.js` - `function_34`**:
   - This function is a hook added to Prism.js's `wrap` event. Although it specifically handles entity tokens, it is part of the overall token processing pipeline. If there is an issue with how tokens are being wrapped or processed, this function could be indirectly related to the problem.

### Additional Considerations

Since the specific reST grammar definition is not provided in the relevant files, it is likely that the issue lies within the reST language definition itself. This would typically be found in a separate file defining the reST grammar rules, which would include patterns for matching link and verbatim elements. If such a file exists, it should also be examined for the relevant functions or classes.
