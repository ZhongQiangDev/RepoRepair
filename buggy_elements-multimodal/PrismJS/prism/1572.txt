### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that G-code syntax highlighting is not currently supported in the Prism.js library. The request is to add G-code syntax highlighting with the language identifier `gcode` so that G-code files can be properly highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the G-code language definition is not included in the Prism.js library. The provided implementation for G-code syntax highlighting exists in a separate repository (https://github.com/kmoser77/prismjs-reprap-gcode), but it needs to be integrated into the main Prism.js library to be recognized and used.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/index.js ---
This file contains the `loadLanguages` function, which is responsible for dynamically loading language definitions into Prism.js. To add G-code support, this function needs to be able to load the G-code language definition.

```
components/index.js
function: loadLanguages
```

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of the Prism.js library, including tokenization, highlighting, and language management. The `languages` object in this file needs to be extended to include the G-code language definition.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
components/index.js
function: loadLanguages

components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

### Additional Notes

- The G-code language definition provided in the GitHub problem description should be added to the `Prism.languages` object in `prism-core.js`.
- The `loadLanguages` function in `index.js` should be updated to recognize and load the `gcode` language identifier.
- No other files or functions in the provided information seem directly relevant to the issue.
