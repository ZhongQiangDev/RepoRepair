### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that YAML string highlighting fails when a string has a comment on the same line. Specifically, the string `"world" # test` is not properly highlighted, indicating that the comment handling within YAML strings is not functioning as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prism.js handles comments within YAML strings. The YAML language definition in Prism.js may not be correctly configured to recognize and handle comments that appear immediately after a string. This could be due to the regex patterns used for tokenizing the YAML syntax not accounting for this specific case.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- prism.js (YAML Language Definition) ---
The YAML language definition is not explicitly provided in the given file information. However, based on the problem description, the issue is likely related to the YAML language definition within Prism.js. The relevant function or class would be the one defining the YAML language rules.

```
prism.js
function: Prism.languages.yaml
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
prism.js
function: Prism.languages.yaml
```

This function is responsible for defining the YAML language rules in Prism.js. To fix the issue, the YAML language definition needs to be updated to correctly handle comments within strings. This may involve modifying the regex patterns used for tokenizing YAML syntax to include the case where a comment appears immediately after a string.
