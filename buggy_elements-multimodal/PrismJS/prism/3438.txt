### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the URL string inside the `url()` function is not being highlighted correctly. Instead of being treated as a single string, parts of the URL are being incorrectly interpreted as separate CSS properties or values, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the regex pattern used to match the URL string within the `url()` function. The current pattern may not be correctly identifying the entire URL string as a single entity, causing parts of the URL to be misinterpreted as other CSS constructs.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-css-extras.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### components/prism-css.js
```
components/prism-css.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `components/prism-css.js` defines the CSS language rules, including the `url` pattern. This function is likely where the issue lies, as it defines how URLs are matched and highlighted.

#### plugins/autolinker/prism-autolinker.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
