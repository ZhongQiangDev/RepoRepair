### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the keyword `isolated` in front of a function body parameter type is not being highlighted as a keyword. This is evident from the provided image where `isolated` is not highlighted in the same way as other keywords like `func` or `Double`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely that the `isolated` keyword is not included in the list of recognized keywords for Swift in the PrismJS syntax highlighting configuration. As a result, PrismJS does not apply the appropriate highlighting style to it.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-swift.js ---

This file is likely where the Swift language definition for PrismJS is defined. It contains the rules and patterns that PrismJS uses to identify and highlight different parts of the Swift syntax.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `isolated` keyword is included in the list of recognized keywords. This would typically involve modifying the regular expression or list of keywords in the Swift language definition.

```js
components/prism-swift.js
function: Prism.languages.swift
```

This file contains the relevant function `Prism.languages.swift` which defines the Swift language syntax highlighting rules. We need to inspect and potentially edit this function to include the `isolated` keyword in the list of recognized keywords.

### Summary

- **Wrong Behavior**: The `isolated` keyword is not highlighted as a keyword.
- **Cause**: The `isolated` keyword is not included in the list of recognized keywords in the PrismJS Swift language definition.
- **Relevant File and Function**:
  ```
  components/prism-swift.js
  function: Prism.languages.swift
  ```
