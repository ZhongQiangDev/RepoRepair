### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description highlights two main issues:

1. **Scala Comment Rendering Issue**: In Scala code, comments (including `//`) are incorrectly rendered as titles when they appear on the same line as a class declaration but before the opening curly brace `{`. This results in improper syntax highlighting.

2. **JavaScript Comment Highlighting Issue**: In JavaScript code, comments inside function parameters are not highlighted correctly. The comments are not recognized as comments and thus do not receive the appropriate styling.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Scala Comment Rendering Issue:
The issue likely stems from how the Scala language definition in Highlight.js handles comments and class declarations. The current regex patterns or rules for identifying comments and class declarations might be conflicting when comments appear in specific positions relative to class declarations.

#### JavaScript Comment Highlighting Issue:
The problem may be due to the JavaScript language definition in Highlight.js not properly accounting for comments within function parameters. The regex patterns or rules for identifying comments might not be correctly configured to handle this specific syntax.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/highlight.js`
```
src/highlight.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains the core initialization and extension point for the Highlight.js library. While it sets up global variables and defines utility functions, it does not directly handle language-specific syntax highlighting rules. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the specific issues described.

#### `src/languages/javascript.js`
```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```
This file defines the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript. The issue with comments inside function parameters likely involves the rules defined in this file. The `function_1` function sets up the language constructs and rules for JavaScript, including comments. Therefore, this function is relevant to the JavaScript comment highlighting issue.

#### `src/languages/scala.js`
```
src/languages/scala.js
function: function_1
```
This file defines the syntax highlighting configuration for Scala. The issue with comments being rendered as titles likely involves the rules defined in this file. The `function_1` function sets up the language constructs and rules for Scala, including comments. Therefore, this function is relevant to the Scala comment rendering issue.

#### `src/lib/modes.js`
```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```
This file contains utility functions for creating comment modes. The `function_3` (COMMENT) function is used to define comment modes, which could be relevant to both the Scala and JavaScript comment issues. However, the specific language definitions in `src/languages/scala.js` and `src/languages/javascript.js` would still need to correctly utilize these comment modes.

#### `types/index.d.ts`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not directly influence the behavior of syntax highlighting rules. Therefore, it is not relevant to the issues described.
