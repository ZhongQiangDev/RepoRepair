### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that PHP variables are not being highlighted correctly. In the actual behavior image, variables such as `$response` are not highlighted, making the code less readable. The expected behavior is for variables to be highlighted, as shown in the expected behavior image.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the syntax highlighting rules defined for PHP in the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the rules for identifying and highlighting PHP variables may not be correctly implemented or may be missing. This would result in variables not being recognized and therefore not being highlighted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/php-template.js`

This file contains a function `function_1` that defines a custom syntax highlighting rule for PHP templates embedded within XML or HTML. While this function does define rules for PHP blocks, it does not specifically address the highlighting of PHP variables. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the issue of variable highlighting.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/php.js`

This file contains a function `function_1` that defines the language definition for PHP, including rules for highlighting various PHP constructs such as variables, strings, numbers, and keywords. The function defines a `VARIABLE` pattern that should match PHP variables, which start with a dollar sign (`$`) followed by a valid variable name.

Given the issue described, the `VARIABLE` pattern in this function is likely not being applied correctly, or there may be an issue with how the pattern is defined or integrated into the overall highlighting rules.

```
src/languages/php.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary

The issue of PHP variables not being highlighted is likely due to a problem with the `VARIABLE` pattern defined in the `function_1` function within the `src/languages/php.js` file. This function should be inspected and potentially edited to ensure that the `VARIABLE` pattern is correctly defined and applied to highlight PHP variables.
