### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that an empty block comment (`/**/`) in JavaScript code breaks the syntax highlighting. Specifically, the code `/**/console.log("Hello, World!")/**/` is not highlighted correctly, and the highlighting seems to break after the empty block comment.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the syntax highlighting engine handles block comments. When it encounters an empty block comment (`/**/`), it may not properly recognize the end of the comment, leading to incorrect parsing of the subsequent code. This could be due to a flaw in the comment detection logic or how the engine processes consecutive comments.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of the highlight.js library, including the `highlight` function which processes code with a specified language. However, the specific issue with empty block comments is more likely related to the language-specific rules defined in the JavaScript language file.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/javascript.js ---
This file defines the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript. The `function_1` function in this file sets up the rules for various JavaScript constructs, including comments. The `COMMENT` helper function is particularly relevant here as it defines how block comments are handled.

```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
This file contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting modes. The `COMMENT` function in this file is used to create comment modes, which are likely used by the JavaScript language configuration.

```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```
2. ```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```

These locations are directly related to the handling of comments in JavaScript syntax highlighting and should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue with empty block comments breaking the highlighting.
