### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the brackets (`{` and `}`) in the class inheritance context are highlighted with different colors instead of the same color as expected. This issue is observed in the VSCode markdown preview and reproduced in JSFiddle.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for Kotlin in the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the rules for identifying and highlighting brackets in the context of class definitions and inheritance might be incorrectly configured or missing. This could result in the brackets being treated as part of different syntax elements, leading to inconsistent highlighting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---

This file contains the core initialization and configuration module for the Highlight.js library. While it sets up the overall framework for syntax highlighting, it does not define language-specific rules. Therefore, it is unlikely to contain the cause of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/kotlin.js ---

This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for Kotlin. The issue is likely related to how brackets are handled in the context of class definitions and inheritance. We need to examine the patterns and rules defined for highlighting brackets.

```
src/languages/kotlin.js
function: function_1
```

### Relevant Locations in `function_1`

1. **Keywords and Literals**: Ensure that keywords like `class` and `:` are correctly identified and do not interfere with bracket highlighting.
2. **Functions and Classes**: Check the patterns for highlighting function and class definitions to ensure that brackets are consistently highlighted.
3. **Miscellaneous**: Review any additional patterns that might affect bracket highlighting in the context of class inheritance.

### Summary

The issue is likely caused by incorrect or missing syntax highlighting rules for brackets in the context of class definitions and inheritance in the `kotlin.js` file. The relevant function to inspect and potentially edit is `function_1` in `src/languages/kotlin.js`.
