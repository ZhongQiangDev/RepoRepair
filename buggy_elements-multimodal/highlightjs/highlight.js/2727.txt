### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that member functions within ES6 classes are not being highlighted when using `highlight.js` in a React application with `marked`. The screenshot provided shows that the functions within the class are not visually distinguished from other parts of the code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the configuration or limitations of the `highlight.js` library when it comes to recognizing and highlighting ES6 class syntax, particularly member functions. The `highlightAuto` function may not be correctly identifying the language or the specific syntax patterns for ES6 classes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains the core initialization and extension point for the `highlight.js` library. It is relevant because it sets up the global variables and defines the utility functions used for syntax highlighting. The `highlightAuto` function, which is used in the problem description, is defined here. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
src/highlight.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/languages/javascript.js`

This file defines the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript, including ES6 features. It is relevant because it specifies the language rules that `highlight.js` uses to highlight JavaScript code. If the rules for ES6 class syntax are not correctly defined, this could be the cause of the issue.

```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/languages/typescript.js`

This file extends the JavaScript syntax highlighting rules to support TypeScript-specific features. While the problem description is about JavaScript, it is possible that the issue could be related to how TypeScript-specific rules are affecting the JavaScript highlighting. However, since the problem is specifically about JavaScript, this file is less likely to be directly relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
