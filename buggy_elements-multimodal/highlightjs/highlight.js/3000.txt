### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect syntax highlighting of PHP arrow functions. Specifically, the highlighter incorrectly identifies parts of the arrow function as a `title` when they should be recognized as variables or other PHP constructs. This is evident in the sample code provided, where `$x` and `$y` are incorrectly highlighted as `title` instead of `variable`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the PHP language definition within the Highlight.js library. The current rules for recognizing PHP arrow functions (`fn(...) => ...`) may not be correctly distinguishing between the function parameters and the function body. As a result, the highlighter misinterprets parts of the function as titles instead of variables or other appropriate constructs.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains the core functionality of the Highlight.js library, including the `highlight` function, which processes code with a specified language. However, the issue described is specific to the PHP language definition, so the core highlighting functionality is not directly responsible for the incorrect highlighting of PHP arrow functions.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/php.js`

This file contains the language definition for PHP, which includes patterns and rules for different PHP constructs. The issue described is likely related to the rules defined for PHP arrow functions. The function `function_1` in this file is responsible for defining these rules.

```
src/languages/php.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary

The issue with incorrect highlighting of PHP arrow functions is likely caused by the PHP language definition in `src/languages/php.js`. The function `function_1` in this file needs to be inspected and potentially modified to correctly handle PHP arrow functions. No other files or functions appear to be directly relevant to this specific issue.
