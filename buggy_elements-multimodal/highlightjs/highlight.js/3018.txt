### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `BigInt` type is not being highlighted as a built-in type in the same way that `Number` is. This results in `BigInt` not being recognized and styled appropriately in the syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of `BigInt` in the list of built-in types or keywords that the syntax highlighting library (Highlight.js) uses to identify and style these types. The same issue may also apply to `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array`, which are also not being recognized.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/c-like.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to JavaScript and ECMAScript, not C++.

#### `src/languages/javascript.js`

This file contains relevant functions/classes. The `function_1` function is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript. The `KEYWORDS` object, which contains the list of keywords and built-ins, needs to be updated to include `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array`.

```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/languages/typescript.js`

This file contains relevant functions/classes. The `function_1` function extends the JavaScript syntax highlighting rules to support TypeScript. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it is also necessary to ensure that `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` are recognized in TypeScript code.

```
src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```
