### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when the Elixir code snippet includes a function capture (`&function_name/arity`), the syntax highlighting incorrectly treats the `/` as part of a different context, leading to improper highlighting of the subsequent code. Specifically, the function capture `&letter?/1` is not highlighted correctly, and the code following it is also affected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the regular expressions used in the Elixir syntax highlighting configuration. The current regex patterns may not correctly identify the function capture syntax (`&function_name/arity`), causing the `/` to be misinterpreted. This misinterpretation disrupts the highlighting of the rest of the code.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/languages/elixir.js`

This file contains the relevant function for defining the Elixir syntax highlighting configuration. The function `function_1` is responsible for defining the patterns and rules for highlighting Elixir code. The issue likely lies within the regular expressions and rules defined in this function.

```
src/languages/elixir.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/languages/elixir.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `src/languages/elixir.js` needs to be inspected and potentially modified to correctly handle the function capture syntax (`&function_name/arity`) in Elixir. This may involve adjusting the regular expressions and rules that define how function captures are identified and highlighted.
