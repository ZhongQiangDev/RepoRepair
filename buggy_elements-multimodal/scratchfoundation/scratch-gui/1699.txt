### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when opening the sprite library on an iPad, the search bar is focused, causing the keyboard to pop up. This results in the keyboard taking up a significant portion of the screen, making it difficult to see the sprites.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the search bar in the `LibraryComponent` being automatically focused when the library is opened. This focus event triggers the keyboard to appear on touch devices like iPads. The issue is related to the handling of focus events within the `LibraryComponent` and possibly the `SpriteLibrary` component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/components/library/library.jsx

This file contains the `LibraryComponent`, which is the core component responsible for rendering the library and handling the search bar. The focus event on the search bar is likely the source of the problem.

```
src/components/library/library.jsx
class: LibraryComponent
```

#### src/components/library-item/library-item.jsx

This file contains the `LibraryItem` component, which is responsible for rendering individual items in the library. It does not directly handle the search bar or focus events.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/containers/backdrop-library.jsx

This file contains the `BackdropLibrary` component, which uses the `LibraryComponent` to render a library of backdrops. It does not directly handle the search bar or focus events.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/containers/costume-library.jsx

This file contains the `CostumeLibrary` component, which uses the `LibraryComponent` to render a library of costumes. It does not directly handle the search bar or focus events.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/containers/sprite-library.jsx

This file contains the `SpriteLibrary` component, which uses the `LibraryComponent` to render a library of sprites. It is directly related to the issue since it is the component that is opened when the problem occurs.

```
src/containers/sprite-library.jsx
class: SpriteLibrary
```
