### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is the absence of a watermark indicating the selected sprite or backdrop on the blocks workspace. This feature was present in version 2.0 but is missing in the current version. The watermark should be a small image (48px by 48px) positioned at the top-right corner of the blocks workspace, aligned with the zoom controls, and should have an opacity of 35%.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the removal or modification of the code responsible for rendering the watermark in the blocks workspace. This could involve changes in the React components that manage the blocks workspace, sprite selection, or the overall layout of the Scratch interface. The watermark's positioning, sizing, and opacity also need to be correctly implemented to match the specifications.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx`
This file contains the `BlocksComponent` which is responsible for rendering the blocks workspace. Since the watermark needs to be added to the blocks workspace, this file is relevant.

```
src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### `src/components/sprite-selector-item/sprite-selector-item.jsx`
This file contains the `SpriteSelectorItem` component, which manages the sprite selection and rendering. While it is related to sprites, it does not directly handle the blocks workspace or the watermark. However, it might be useful for obtaining the selected sprite's image URL.

```
src/components/sprite-selector-item/sprite-selector-item.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### `src/containers/blocks.jsx`
This file contains the `Blocks` class, which manages the Blockly workspace and its interactions. It is relevant because it initializes and configures the workspace where the watermark should be added.

```
src/containers/blocks.jsx
class: Blocks
```

#### `src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx`
This file contains the `SpriteSelectorItem` class and related functions. It is relevant for obtaining the selected sprite's image URL, which is necessary for the watermark.

```
src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx
class: SpriteSelectorItem
function: function_1
function: function_2
```

#### `src/containers/target-pane.jsx`
This file contains the `TargetPane` class, which manages sprite-related operations. It is relevant for obtaining the selected sprite's image URL and managing sprite selection.

```
src/containers/target-pane.jsx
class: TargetPane
function: function_1
function: function_3
```
