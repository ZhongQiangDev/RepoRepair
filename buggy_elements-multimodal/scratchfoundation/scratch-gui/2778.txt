### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the `GitHub Problem Description` is that the project is using an outdated version of the `autoprefixer` package (version 8.6.5), while a newer version (9.0.0) has been released. The current version range does not cover the latest version, which may introduce breaking changes and improvements that the project is missing out on.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the project's `package.json` file (or similar dependency management file) specifies a version range for `autoprefixer` that does not include the latest version 9.0.0. This could be due to the version range being too restrictive (e.g., `^8.6.5`), which only allows updates within the 8.x.x series. Additionally, the project may not have been updated to accommodate the breaking changes introduced in version 9.0.0, such as the removal of support for older Node.js versions and changes in the Browserslist configuration.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `webpack.config.js`

This file contains a function `function_1` (internally named `plugins`) that returns an array of PostCSS plugins, including `autoprefixer`. Since the problem involves updating `autoprefixer`, this function is directly relevant.

```
webpack.config.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
webpack.config.js

```

### Additional Considerations

- **package.json**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided files, the `package.json` file should also be inspected and updated to include the latest version of `autoprefixer` and adjust the version range if necessary.
- **Browserslist Configuration**: If the project uses a Browserslist configuration file, it should be reviewed to ensure compatibility with the changes introduced in Browserslist 4.0.
- **Node.js Version**: Ensure that the project is running on a supported Node.js version (Node.js 6, 8, or 10) as specified in the release notes for `autoprefixer` 9.0.0.
