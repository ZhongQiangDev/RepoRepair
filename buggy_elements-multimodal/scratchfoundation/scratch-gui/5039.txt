### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a sprite is dragged to another space, the duplicate menu does not appear as expected. Instead, the operating system's context menu appears.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the way the context menu is triggered and managed during drag-and-drop operations. When a sprite is dragged, the drag event might be interfering with the right-click event, preventing the context menu from appearing. Additionally, the OS context menu appearing suggests that the drag event is not properly handled or prevented from propagating.

class: SpriteSelectorItem
```

The `SpriteSelectorItem` class manages the sprite item's state and interactions, including drag-and-drop functionality. The issue might be related to how drag events are handled and whether they interfere with the context menu.

#### `src/lib/drag-recognizer.js`
