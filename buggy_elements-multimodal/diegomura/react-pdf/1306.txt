### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the type definition for `SourceObject` in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` does not support a function that returns a `Promise<string>`, even though the documentation states that it should. This mismatch causes a compilation error when trying to use a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as the `src` for an `<Image>` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the `SourceObject` type definition in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` is missing the support for a function that returns a `Promise<string>`. The documentation suggests that such a function should be supported, but the actual type definition does not include this case. This discrepancy leads to the TypeScript compiler throwing an error when it encounters a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as the `src`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/types/image.d.ts`
This file contains the `SourceObject` type definition, which is directly related to the issue. The type definition needs to be updated to include the missing case for a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.

```
packages/types/image.d.ts
function: SourceObject
```

#### `packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js`
This file contains the `fetchImage` function, which handles the resolution and fetching of images. It may need to be updated to handle the case where the `src` is a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.

```
packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js
function: fetchImage
```

#### `packages/layout/src/image/getSource.js`
This file contains the `getSource` function, which retrieves the image source from the node. It may need to be updated to handle the case where the `src` is a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.

```
packages/layout/src/image/getSource.js
function: getSource
```

#### `packages/image/src/cache.js`
This file contains functions related to caching images. It does not seem directly related to the issue of handling a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as the `src`.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/image/src/resolve.js`
This file contains various functions for resolving and processing image sources. It may need to be updated to handle the case where the `src` is a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.

```
packages/image/src/resolve.js
function: resolveImage
function: resolveSrc
```
