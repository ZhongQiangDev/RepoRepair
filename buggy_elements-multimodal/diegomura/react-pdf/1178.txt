### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the `margin: auto` property does not work as expected in version 2 of the `react-pdf` library. Specifically, when comparing the layout of elements with `margin: auto` in version 1 and version 2, the elements in version 2 do not center as they should, indicating that the `margin: auto` functionality is broken.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `margin: auto` property is being handled or calculated within the layout engine of `react-pdf` version 2. The layout engine uses the Yoga library for layout calculations, and the issue might be related to how `margin: auto` is being set or interpreted by the Yoga nodes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/layout/src/node/getMargin.js ---
```
packages/layout/src/node/getMargin.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` function calculates margins for a given Yoga node. This function is relevant because it handles the calculation of margins, including `margin: auto`, which is the core issue described in the GitHub problem.

#### --- packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js ---
```
packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function sets Yoga properties, including handling the 'auto' value for margins. This function is directly related to the issue since it determines how 'auto' values are applied to Yoga nodes.

#### --- packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file deal with resolving dimensions and persisting layout data but do not directly handle margin calculations or the 'auto' value.

#### --- packages/layout/src/steps/resolveStyles.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file resolve styles and apply them to nodes but do not specifically handle margin calculations or the 'auto' value.

#### --- packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file expand shorthand CSS properties and process specific CSS values but do not directly handle margin calculations or the 'auto' value.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The relevant locations that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
packages/layout/src/node/getMargin.js
function: function_2

packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
function: function_1
```
