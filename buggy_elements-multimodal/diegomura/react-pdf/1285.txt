### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is the deprecation warning related to the `Buffer()` constructor. This warning indicates that the `Buffer()` constructor is deprecated due to security and usability issues and will be removed in future Node.js versions. This will break the rendering process if not addressed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this warning is the use of the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor in the codebase. The warning suggests using `Buffer.alloc()`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`, or `Buffer.from()` methods instead. The issue likely arises from any part of the codebase where `Buffer()` is used directly without these recommended methods.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/fontkit/src/base.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/fontkit/src/glyph/SBIXGlyph.js ---
```
packages/fontkit/src/glyph/SBIXGlyph.js
function: function_1
```
The function `function_1` uses `new r.Buffer(t => t.parent.buflen - t._currentOffset)`, which is the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor.

#### --- packages/image/src/resolve.js ---
```
packages/image/src/resolve.js
function: function_10
function: function_12
function: function_14
function: function_16
function: function_17
function: function_18
function: function_5
function: function_7
function: getImage
```
- `function_10`: Uses `Buffer` to convert base64 data.
- `function_12`: Uses `Buffer` to handle image data.
- `function_14`: Uses `Buffer` to parse image formats.
- `function_16`: Uses `Buffer` to check image formats.
- `function_17`: Uses `Buffer` to fetch and process images.
- `function_18`: Uses `Buffer` to resolve images.
- `function_5`: Uses `Buffer` to handle remote file fetching.
- `function_7`: Uses `Buffer` to guess image formats.
- `getImage`: Uses `Buffer` to create image objects.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
packages/fontkit/src/glyph/SBIXGlyph.js
function: function_1
```
2. ```
packages/image/src/resolve.js
function: function_10
function: function_12
function: function_14
function: function_16
function: function_17
```
3. ```
packages/image/src/resolve.js
function: function_18
function: function_5
function: function_7
function: getImage
```

These locations need inspection or editing to replace the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor with `Buffer.alloc()`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`, or `Buffer.from()` methods.
