### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the styled components `ExampleText1`, `ExampleText2`, and `ExampleText3` are not applying the overridden styles as expected. All three texts appear with the same styling, despite the intention to have different colors and border styles.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the styles are being applied and resolved within the `@react-pdf/renderer` and `@react-pdf/styled-components` libraries. The styles are being defined correctly using the `styled` API, but they are not being properly applied or resolved during the rendering process. This could be due to:

- Incorrect handling of style inheritance or overriding in the `@react-pdf/styled-components` library.
- Issues with the `StyleSheet` or style resolution logic in `@react-pdf/renderer`.
- Potential bugs in the `styled-components` integration with `@react-pdf/renderer`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/elements/Base.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Base` class manages general layout and rendering but does not specifically handle styled components or style overriding.

#### --- src/elements/Text.js ---
```
src/elements/Text.js
class: Text
```
The `Text` class is responsible for text rendering and layout. It includes methods for styling and rendering text, which could be relevant to the issue. Specifically, the `render` method applies transformations, background color, and borders, which might be where the styles are not being applied correctly.

#### --- src/stylesheet/index.js ---
```
src/stylesheet/index.js
function: function_7
```
The `function_7` function processes styles, flattens them, resolves media queries, and transforms them. This function is crucial for ensuring that styles are correctly applied and could be where the issue lies if styles are not being flattened or transformed properly.

#### --- src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js ---
```
src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` function transforms styles by expanding shorthand properties and resolving specific style categories. This function is essential for ensuring that styles are in the correct format for rendering, and any issues here could prevent the styles from being applied correctly.

#### --- src/utils/styles.js ---
```
src/utils/styles.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function merges multiple style objects into a single object. This function could be relevant if there are issues with merging the styles from the different `ExampleText` components, leading to the styles not being applied as expected.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `src/elements/Text.js`
   - `class: Text`

2. `src/stylesheet/index.js`
   - `function: function_7`

3. `src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js`
   - `function: function_2`

4. `src/utils/styles.js`
   - `function: function_1`

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue with the styles not being applied correctly.
