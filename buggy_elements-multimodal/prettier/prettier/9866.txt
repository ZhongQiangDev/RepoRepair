### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that Prettier is not consistently formatting JSX code containing the full-width space character (`　`). Specifically, the formatting of the JSX code changes unpredictably between runs, leading to inconsistent output. The expected behavior is that the formatting should be stable and consistent across multiple runs.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to be related to how Prettier handles the full-width space character (`　`). This character is a Unicode character (U+3000) that is visually similar to a regular space but is treated differently by some text processing systems. The inconsistency in formatting suggests that Prettier might be inconsistently recognizing or handling this character during the formatting process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/common/util.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/language-html/printer-html.js`

```
src/language-html/printer-html.js
function: printOpeningTag
function: printClosingTag
function: printChildren
function: printEmbeddedAttributeValue
```

These functions are involved in printing and formatting HTML tags and attributes, which could be relevant to the JSX formatting issue.

#### `src/language-html/utils.js`

```
src/language-html/utils.js
function: isWhitespaceSensitiveNode
function: isIndentationSensitiveNode
function: isBlockLikeCssDisplay
function: isDanglingSpaceSensitiveNode
function: isBlockLikeCssDisplay
```

These functions are related to determining the formatting behavior of nodes based on their properties, which could influence how the full-width space character is handled.

#### `src/language-js/embed.js`

```
src/language-js/embed.js
function: embed
function: printHtmlTemplateLiteral
function: printJSXElement
function: printJSXChildren
```

These functions are directly involved in handling JSX elements and template literals, which are relevant to the issue.

#### `src/language-js/printer-estree.js`

```
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
function: printPathNoParens
function: printJSXElement
function: printJSXChildren
function: printStatementSequence
function: printMethod
```

These functions are involved in printing and formatting JavaScript and JSX code, which could be relevant to the issue.

### Summary

The functions identified in `src/language-html/printer-html.js`, `src/language-html/utils.js`, `src/language-js/embed.js`, and `src/language-js/printer-estree.js` are relevant to the issue of inconsistent JSX formatting involving the full-width space character. These functions handle the printing and formatting of HTML/JSX elements and attributes, and their behavior could be contributing to the observed inconsistency.
