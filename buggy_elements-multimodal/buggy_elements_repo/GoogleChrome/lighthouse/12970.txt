### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse is incorrectly identifying local resources (`file:///`) as render-blocking resources. This is incorrect because local resources are blocked from loading, and thus should not be considered render-blocking.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how Lighthouse identifies and processes resources as render-blocking. Specifically, the issue may be related to how Lighthouse handles local resources (`file:///`) in its dependency graph and timing calculations. The audit logic may not be correctly filtering out or handling these local resources, leading to their incorrect classification as render-blocking.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/render-blocking-resources.js ---
This file contains the core logic for identifying render-blocking resources. The `RenderBlockingResources` class and its methods are likely relevant to the issue.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/render-blocking-resources.js
class: RenderBlockingResources
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/lantern-first-contentful-paint.js ---
This file contains logic related to computing the First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric, which is relevant to identifying render-blocking resources. The `LanternFirstContentfulPaint` class and its methods may be relevant.

```
lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/lantern-first-contentful-paint.js
class: LanternFirstContentfulPaint
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/lantern-metric.js ---
This file contains general metric computation logic, but it does not seem directly related to the specific issue of local resources being incorrectly identified as render-blocking.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/metric.js ---
This file contains general metric computation logic, but it does not seem directly related to the specific issue of local resources being incorrectly identified as render-blocking.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/traces/pwmetrics-events.js ---
This file contains functions for extracting metrics from audit results, but it does not seem directly related to the specific issue of local resources being incorrectly identified as render-blocking.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
