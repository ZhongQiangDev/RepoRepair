### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is a style problem with the PWA header gauge. Specifically, the PWA gauge appears to be missing its fill color and text, making it look different from the other gauges (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO). The PWA gauge is only showing an outline without the expected numerical score and color fill.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the rendering logic for the PWA category gauge. The gauge's fill color and text are not being rendered correctly, which suggests a problem with the rendering function responsible for generating the gauge's visual elements. This could be due to a missing or incorrect SVG ID, a failure to set the fill color, or an issue with the text rendering.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/installable-manifest.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `InstallableManifest` class is responsible for auditing the web app manifest, not for rendering the gauge.

#### lighthouse-core/computed/manifest-values.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `ManifestValues` class is responsible for validating the web app manifest, not for rendering the gauge.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/details-renderer.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `DetailsRenderer` class is responsible for rendering audit details into HTML elements, but it does not specifically handle the rendering of the PWA gauge.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/pwa-category-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/pwa-category-renderer.js
class: PwaCategoryRenderer
function: function_1
```

The `PwaCategoryRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the audit results of the PWA category, including the score gauge. The `renderScoreGauge` method within this class is likely responsible for generating the visual score gauge. The `function_1` (getUniqueSuffix) is used to ensure unique IDs for SVG elements, which is relevant for avoiding conflicts when rendering multiple gauges.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```

The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for generating the overall Lighthouse report, including the report header where the category scores are displayed. While it delegates the rendering of specific categories to specialized renderers like `PwaCategoryRenderer`, it is still relevant as it sets up the context for rendering the report.
