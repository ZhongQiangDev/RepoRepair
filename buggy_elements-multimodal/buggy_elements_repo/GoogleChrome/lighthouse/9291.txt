### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the i18n text is not being translated when running the Lighthouse CLI with a fatal error. The error message displayed is in English, even though the user might expect it to be in their preferred language.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the error handling and reporting mechanism in the Lighthouse CLI does not properly integrate with the i18n system. When a fatal error occurs, the error message is printed directly without being processed through the i18n functions that would translate the message into the user's preferred language.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-cli/bin.js

This file contains the entry point for the Lighthouse CLI and handles the execution flow. It does not directly handle error messages or translations, but it calls functions that might need to be inspected.

```
lighthouse-cli/bin.js
function: begin
```

#### lighthouse-cli/cli-flags.js

This file handles command-line arguments and configurations but does not directly relate to error handling or translations.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js

This file contains functions related to internationalization and message formatting. It is highly relevant to the issue.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
function: getFormatted
function: getFormattedFromIdAndValues
function: replaceIcuMessageInstanceIds
function: _resolveIcuMessageInstanceId
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js

This file contains a function for swapping locales in the Lighthouse Result object. It is relevant as it deals with locale changes but may not directly handle the error message translation.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js
function: swapLocale
```

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/util.js

This file contains utility functions for report rendering and does not directly relate to error handling or translations.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
