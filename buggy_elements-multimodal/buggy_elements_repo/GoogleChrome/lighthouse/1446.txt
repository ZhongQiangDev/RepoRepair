### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that while the perf metrics are being visualized in the Timeline, the markers for these metrics are difficult to deal with from a UX perspective. The markers are created by injecting fake trace events into the trace data, which are then displayed in the Timeline view. The issue is that these markers are not user-friendly and could be improved for better usability.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely related to how the fake trace events are being injected into the trace data and how these events are then visualized in the Timeline. The current method of injecting fake trace events may not be optimal for creating clear and user-friendly markers. Additionally, the Timeline view in DevTools may not be designed to handle these types of markers effectively, leading to a poor user experience.

function: saveAssets
```

The `prepareAssets` function is responsible for generating fake events based on the trace events and audit results, which are then concatenated to the original trace events. The `saveAssets` function saves these prepared assets, including the traces with the fake events, to disk. These functions are directly related to the injection of fake trace events.
