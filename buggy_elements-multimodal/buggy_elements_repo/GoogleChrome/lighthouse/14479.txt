### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the DOM size audit is displaying values with unnecessary decimal places (e.g., `2,008.0` instead of `2,008`). The values should be integers without the `.0` suffix.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the formatting of the numbers in the audit results. The numbers are being formatted to include decimal places, even though they are integers. This could be happening in the code that generates the display values for the audit results.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

core/audits/dobetterweb/dom-size.js
class: DOMSize
```
The `DOMSize` class is responsible for performing the DOM size audit and generating the audit results. The issue might be in how the numeric values are formatted before being included in the audit product.

#### --- report/renderer/i18n.js ---
```
report/renderer/i18n.js
class: I18n
```
The `I18n` class is responsible for formatting numbers and other data types according to the specified locale. The issue might be in the `formatInteger` method or another formatting method that is being used to format the integer values.
