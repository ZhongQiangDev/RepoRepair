### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that inserting `console.log('$');` into `report-renderer.js` causes the JavaScript injection to escape the page. This indicates that the `String.replace` method is being used in a way that allows the `$` character to be interpreted as a special character, leading to unintended string replacements and potentially breaking the page.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the way `String.replace` handles special characters like `$`. According to the MDN documentation, `$` is a special character in the replacement string that can be used to insert parts of the original string. If the replacement string contains `$`, it can lead to unexpected results, such as injecting additional code or breaking the intended string replacement logic.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/report/formatter.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/handlebar-helpers.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/report-generator.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-renderer.js
function: render
```

The `render` function in `report-renderer.js` is responsible for rendering the JSON report into a `<pre>` element. If this function uses `String.replace` or any other string manipulation that involves the `$` character, it could be the source of the issue. However, based on the provided code snippet, the `render` function does not directly use `String.replace`. It is possible that the issue lies in another part of the code that is not shown here.

#### lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Conclusion

The most likely location for the issue is in the `render` function of `report-renderer.js`. This function is responsible for rendering the JSON report, and if it or any related code uses `String.replace` with the `$` character, it could cause the described problem. Further investigation into the actual usage of `String.replace` in the `render` function or related code would be necessary to confirm and fix the issue.
