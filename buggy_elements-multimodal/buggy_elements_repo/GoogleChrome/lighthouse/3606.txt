### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Lighthouse audit is erroneously reporting that text-based responses are not compressed, even though gzip compression is enabled and verified via the DevTools Network panel and a `curl` command. The audit suggests that compression should be enabled, despite the fact that the response headers indicate that gzip compression is already in use.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the Lighthouse audit checks for compression. The audit might be failing to correctly identify that the response is already compressed, possibly due to an issue in how it processes the response headers or content. The audit might be incorrectly flagging the response as uncompressed, leading to the erroneous report.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js`

This file contains the `ResponsesAreCompressed` class, which is directly responsible for performing the audit that checks if responses are compressed. Given the issue described, this class is highly relevant.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js
class: ResponsesAreCompressed
```

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/response-compression.js`

This file contains the `ResponseCompression` class, which analyzes network responses to identify unoptimized responses. This class is also relevant because it filters and processes the network records that are used by the audit.

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/response-compression.js
class: ResponseCompression
```

#### `lighthouse-core/lib/network-recorder.js`

This file contains the `NetworkRecorder` class, which tracks network requests and manages their lifecycle. While this class is involved in recording network activity, it does not directly handle the compression audit. Therefore, it is less likely to be directly related to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js`

This file contains various URL-related functions and the `URLShim` class. These functions and the class are not directly related to the compression audit. Therefore, they are not relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js`

This file contains the `NetworkNode` class, which encapsulates a network request record. While this class is involved in handling network requests, it does not directly handle the compression audit. Therefore, it is less likely to be directly related to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
