### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse overestimates the potential savings for minifying the JavaScript file `amp-date-picker-0.1.js`. Specifically, the report indicates a potential saving of 139 KB, which is incorrect because the file already contains a copyright notice that cannot be minified further.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how Lighthouse calculates the potential savings for minification. The `computeWaste` method in the `UnminifiedJavaScript` class uses `esprima.tokenize` to parse the script content into tokens and then calculates the wasted bytes based on the token length compared to the script content length. If `esprima.tokenize` fails to handle the copyright notice correctly, it may lead to an overestimation of the wasted bytes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unminified-javascript.js

This file contains the `UnminifiedJavaScript` class, which is directly related to the issue. The `computeWaste` method is responsible for calculating the wasted bytes, and it uses `esprima.tokenize` to parse the script content. If `esprima.tokenize` fails to handle the copyright notice correctly, it could lead to the overestimation of savings.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unminified-javascript.js
class: UnminifiedJavaScript
```

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/scripts.js

This file contains the `Scripts` class, which is responsible for collecting the content of all JavaScript files loaded during a web page's execution. While this class is involved in gathering the script content, it does not directly handle the minification analysis or the calculation of potential savings.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js

This file contains the `NetworkRequest` class and several related functions. These functions handle various aspects of network requests, such as timing, response handling, and error management. However, they do not directly relate to the minification analysis or the calculation of potential savings.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/simulator.js

This file contains the `Simulator` class, which is used to simulate the execution of a graph of nodes representing CPU tasks or network requests. This class is not directly related to the minification analysis or the calculation of potential savings.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/traces/trace-parser.js

This file contains the `TraceParser` class, which is responsible for parsing trace events. This class is not directly related to the minification analysis or the calculation of potential savings.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant file and class for fixing the issue are:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unminified-javascript.js
class: UnminifiedJavaScript
```
