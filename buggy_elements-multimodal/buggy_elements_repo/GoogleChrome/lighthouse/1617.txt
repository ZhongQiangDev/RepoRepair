### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the audit reports a false positive for the manifest's `short_name` length when the `short_name` is missing. Specifically, the audit indicates that the `short_name` exceeds the suggested maximum length of 12 characters, even though the `short_name` is not present in the manifest.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the logic of the `ManifestShortNameLength` audit. When the `short_name` is missing, the audit should not report a false positive about the length of the `short_name`. Instead, it should either skip the check or handle the absence of `short_name` appropriately.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js`

This file contains the `ManifestShortNameLength` class, which is directly related to the issue described. The audit logic in this class needs to be examined to ensure it correctly handles the case where `short_name` is missing.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js
class: ManifestShortNameLength
```

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name.js`

This file contains the `ManifestShortName` class, which checks for the presence of the `short_name` property. While this class is related to manifest properties, it does not directly handle the length check, so it is not directly relevant to the specific issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/config/config.js`

This file contains various functions and classes related to configuration and validation. None of these functions or classes directly handle the audit logic for `short_name` length, so they are not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/manifest.js`

This file contains the `Manifest` class, which is responsible for retrieving and parsing the manifest. While this class is related to manifest handling, it does not directly handle the audit logic for `short_name` length, so it is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/lib/manifest-parser.js`

This file contains various functions for parsing manifest properties. While these functions are related to manifest handling, they do not directly handle the audit logic for `short_name` length, so they are not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The only relevant file and class for the described issue is:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js
class: ManifestShortNameLength
```
