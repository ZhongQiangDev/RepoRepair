### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Lighthouse audit tool is encountering an error when trying to detect JavaScript library versions on certain websites, specifically Magento 2 websites. The error message is `version.match is not a function`, indicating that the `version` variable is not a string or does not have a `match` method, which is typically used for string matching.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error `version.match is not a function` suggests that the `version` variable is either `undefined`, `null`, or not a string when the `match` method is called. This could happen if the version detection logic in the Lighthouse audit tool is not correctly handling cases where the version information is missing or not in the expected format. Given that Magento 2 uses `require.js` and has built-in JS bundling, it's possible that the library detection mechanism is not correctly parsing the version information from the bundled JavaScript files.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js

This file contains the `JsLibrariesAudit` class, which is responsible for auditing JavaScript libraries. The `audit` method filters and maps JavaScript library details from the provided artifacts. Since the error is related to version detection, this class is likely relevant.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js
class: JsLibrariesAudit
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/network-recorder.js

This file contains the `NetworkRecorder` class, which is responsible for tracking network requests. While network requests can be relevant to the audit process, this class does not directly handle version detection or library auditing. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the cause of the error.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js

This file contains the `collectStacks` function, which collects information about JavaScript libraries used in a web page. It evaluates a JavaScript expression in the context of the page to detect libraries and their versions. The `detectLibraries` function is also relevant as it iterates over library detection tests and extracts version information. Both functions are likely involved in the version detection process.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
function: collectStacks
function: detectLibraries
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/base-node.js

This file contains the `BaseNode` class, which manages nodes in a dependency graph. This class is not directly related to version detection or library auditing, so it is not relevant to the cause of the error.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js

This file contains the `NetworkNode` class, which encapsulates a network request record. While network requests can be relevant to the audit process, this class does not directly handle version detection or library auditing. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the cause of the error.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
