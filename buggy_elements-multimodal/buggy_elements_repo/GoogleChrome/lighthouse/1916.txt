### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Offscreen Images audit is flagging SVG files with a debug string indicating "Invalid image sizing information." This suggests that the audit is incorrectly processing or evaluating SVG files, which may not have the same sizing information as raster images.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause behind this behavior likely stems from the fact that SVG files are vector graphics and do not have a fixed pixel size like raster images (e.g., PNG, JPEG). The Offscreen Images audit may be attempting to calculate the visible pixels or wasted bytes for SVGs in the same way it does for raster images, leading to incorrect or invalid results. Specifically, the audit might be trying to compute the area of an SVG, which is not applicable in the same way as for raster images.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js`

This file contains the `OffscreenImages` class, which is directly related to the Offscreen Images audit. The audit is likely where the issue is occurring, as it processes images and computes waste. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js
class: OffscreenImages
```

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js`

This file contains the `UsesResponsiveImages` class, which is related to assessing the efficiency of image usage but focuses on responsive images. While it does handle SVGs by ignoring them in its audit, it is not directly related to the Offscreen Images audit. Therefore, this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/accessibility.js`

This file contains the `Accessibility` class, which is related to performing accessibility checks using the axe-core library. It is not related to the Offscreen Images audit or the processing of images. Therefore, this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/viewport-dimensions.js`

This file contains the `ViewportDimensions` class and the `getViewportDimensions` function, which are related to retrieving the dimensions of the viewport. While viewport dimensions can be relevant to determining if an image is offscreen, this file does not directly handle the audit or processing of images. Therefore, this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js`

This file contains various functions related to saving artifacts, traces, and other data generated during a Lighthouse run. These functions are not directly related to the Offscreen Images audit or the processing of images. Therefore, this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The only relevant file is `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js`, which contains the `OffscreenImages` class. The issue likely lies within this class, where the audit logic for processing SVG files needs to be adjusted or excluded.
