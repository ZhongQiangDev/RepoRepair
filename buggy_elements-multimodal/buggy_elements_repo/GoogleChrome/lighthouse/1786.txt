### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that code snippets containing markdown characters (`_` and `[]()`) are being incorrectly rendered as markup instead of being displayed as plain text. This results in the code snippets appearing incorrectly formatted or "wonky."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the markdown parser or renderer not properly handling code snippets that contain markdown syntax characters. When the parser encounters these characters within a code block, it interprets them as markdown syntax rather than as part of the code, leading to incorrect rendering.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/report/handlebar-helpers.js
```
lighthouse-core/report/handlebar-helpers.js
function: function_16
```

The `function_16` function is relevant because it uses the `marked` library to parse and sanitize the input string (`str`). This function is responsible for rendering markdown content, and it appears to be where the issue lies. Specifically, the function needs to ensure that code snippets within markdown are not incorrectly interpreted as markdown syntax.
