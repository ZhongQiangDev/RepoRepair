### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the i18n text is not being translated when a fatal error occurs during a CLI run. Specifically, the error message displayed is not localized according to the user's locale settings.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the error handling and localization processes are not properly integrated. When a fatal error occurs, the error message is displayed without being passed through the localization functions. This could be due to:

- The error handling code not calling the appropriate i18n functions to translate the error message.
- The localization context not being properly set up or passed down to the error handling code.
- The error message being hardcoded or generated in a way that bypasses the localization system.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-cli/bin.js

This file contains the entry point for the Lighthouse CLI and handles command-line arguments and configurations. It does not directly handle error messages or localization, so it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/config/config.js

This file contains functions related to configuration validation and merging. It does not handle error messages or localization directly.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js

This file contains functions related to internationalization (i18n), including message formatting and locale handling. It is highly relevant to the issue.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
function: getFormatted
function: getFormattedFromIdAndValues
function: lookupLocale
function: replaceIcuMessageInstanceIds
function: _resolveIcuMessageInstanceId
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js

This file contains the `swapLocale` function, which is responsible for changing the locale of the Lighthouse Result object. It is relevant to the issue as it deals with locale switching.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js
function: swapLocale
```

#### Other Files

The other files mentioned do not appear to be directly related to the localization of error messages.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The primary files that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

1. `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js`: This file contains functions for formatting and resolving ICU messages, which are crucial for ensuring that error messages are properly localized.
2. `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js`: This file contains the `swapLocale` function, which may need to be called or integrated into the error handling process to ensure the correct locale is used for error messages.
