### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using stacked line charts in Chart.js, the y-axis always begins at zero, even when the `beginAtZero` option is set to `false`. This behavior is incorrect because it does not respect the `beginAtZero` setting, leading to an inaccurate representation of the data.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the y-axis scale is configured and updated when dealing with stacked line charts. Specifically, the problem may be related to how the minimum value of the y-axis is determined when stacking is enabled. The `beginAtZero` option should allow the y-axis to start at a value other than zero if the data warrants it, but this is not happening as expected.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.line.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.line.js
function: getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints
class: LineController
```
The `LineController` class and the `getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints` function are involved in managing the rendering of line charts. However, they do not directly handle the y-axis scale configuration or the `beginAtZero` option. Therefore, while they are part of the line chart rendering process, they are not directly relevant to the issue.

#### --- src/core/core.datasetController.js ---
```
src/core/core.datasetController.js
function: updateStacks
function: applyStack
function: isStacked
```
The `updateStacks` function manages the stack values for each data point, which is relevant to stacked charts. The `applyStack` function processes the stack values, and `isStacked` checks if a scale is stacked. These functions are directly involved in the stacking mechanism and could be contributing to the issue.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---
```
src/core/core.scale.js
class: Scale
function: getUserBounds
function: _addGrace
```
The `Scale` class is responsible for managing scales, including the y-axis scale. The `getUserBounds` function retrieves the user-defined bounds for the scale, which is relevant to the `beginAtZero` option. The `_addGrace` function adjusts the range of values, which could also be relevant to the issue.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.options.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are utility functions for handling options and contexts, but they do not directly manage the y-axis scale or the stacking behavior.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---
```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
class: LinearScale
```
The `LinearScale` class extends the base linear scale and provides methods for determining data limits and converting between data values and pixel positions. This class is directly responsible for managing the y-axis scale and could be where the issue lies.
