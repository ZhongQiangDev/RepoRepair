### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the first and last horizontal labels on the custom scale are getting cut off. This issue is specific to the horizontal labels on the x-axis, and it is expected that these labels should be fully visible, similar to the vertical labels on the y-axis.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the label cutoff likely involves incorrect calculation or application of padding, margins, or dimensions for the horizontal labels. The issue could be related to how the layout system determines the space for these labels, or how the scale calculates the positions of the labels. It might also involve the handling of the chart area dimensions and the placement of the labels within that area.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---

This file contains functions that manage the layout of chart elements, including scales, legends, and titles. Several functions here could be relevant to the issue:

```
src/core/core.layouts.js
function: fitBoxes
function: placeBoxes
function: updateDims
function: updateMaxPadding
function: getMargins
```

These functions are responsible for fitting boxes within the chart area, placing them correctly, updating dimensions, managing padding, and calculating margins. Issues in any of these functions could lead to labels being cut off.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---

This file contains functions and a class related to scales, which are directly involved in positioning and rendering labels.

```
src/core/core.scale.js
class: Scale
function: getPixelForGridLine
function: getTickMarkLength
function: getPixelForValue
function: getLabelForValue
```

The `Scale` class and these functions are responsible for calculating pixel positions for grid lines, tick marks, and labels. If these calculations are incorrect, labels could be positioned incorrectly or cut off.

#### --- src/platform/platform.dom.js ---

This file contains functions related to DOM manipulation and event handling. While it is important for the overall chart rendering, it is less likely to be directly responsible for the label cutoff issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/scales/scale.category.js ---

This file contains the `CategoryScale` class and related functions, which handle categorical data and label placement.

```
src/scales/scale.category.js
class: CategoryScale
function: getPixelForTick
function: getPixelForValue
function: buildTicks
```

The `CategoryScale` class and these functions are responsible for building ticks and calculating pixel positions for labels. Incorrect implementation here could lead to label cutoff.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linearbase.js ---

This file contains the `LinearScaleBase` class and related functions, which handle linear scaling and tick generation.

```
src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
class: LinearScaleBase
function: generateTicks
function: relativeLabelSize
```

The `LinearScaleBase` class and these functions are responsible for generating ticks and calculating label sizes. If these calculations are incorrect, labels could be positioned incorrectly or cut off.

### Summary

The functions and classes identified above are likely to be involved in the issue of horizontal labels being cut off. The problem could be due to incorrect layout calculations, incorrect scale calculations, or incorrect tick and label positioning.
