### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the mouse is quickly moved outside the chart area, the `onLeave` event is not consistently triggered. As a result, the chart elements remain highlighted even though the mouse is outside the chart area. This is evident from the images provided, where the red area remains highlighted despite the cursor being outside the chart.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from the event handling mechanism in Chart.js. Specifically, the `onLeave` event is not being reliably triggered when the mouse quickly exits the chart area. This could be due to several reasons:
- The event listener for `onLeave` might not be properly attached or might be getting detached prematurely.
- There could be a delay or inconsistency in the event propagation, causing the `onLeave` event to be missed when the mouse moves quickly.
- The event handling logic might not be correctly identifying when the mouse has left the chart area.
