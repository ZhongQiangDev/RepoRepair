### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when clicking on a multi-line label in the legend, the action (such as hiding or showing the corresponding dataset) is applied to the wrong label. Specifically, it affects the label above the one clicked, and this issue worsens with an increasing number of labels.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the legend items are positioned and how click events are detected. When the legend is positioned on the right and labels are multi-line, the click event might be incorrectly mapped to the label above due to incorrect calculation of the hit box or bounding box for each label. This could be due to incorrect height calculations for multi-line labels or incorrect event handling logic.

function: onClick
function: _getLegendItemAt
class: Legend
```

The `onClick` function handles the click event on a legend item and toggles the visibility of the corresponding dataset. The `_getLegendItemAt` function is responsible for determining which legend item was clicked based on the event coordinates. The `Legend` class manages the legend's rendering and event handling, including the positioning of legend items.
