### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when `rtl: true` is set in the legend configuration, the text in the legend goes off-screen and is not rendered correctly. This is a regression from the previous version of Chart.js, where the legend text was rendered correctly with RTL support.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from changes in the layout and rendering logic for RTL text in Chart.js v3. Specifically, the `_textX` calculation may not be RTL-aware, leading to incorrect positioning of the text. Additionally, the `renderText` function may not be alignment-aware for multi-line text, causing text to be rendered incorrectly in RTL mode.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---
```
src/core/core.layouts.js
function: update
function: placeBoxes
function: buildLayoutBoxes
```
These functions are responsible for the layout and positioning of chart elements, including the legend. The `update` function manages the overall layout process, `placeBoxes` positions the boxes within the chart area, and `buildLayoutBoxes` organizes the boxes into layout groups. These functions may need to be updated to handle RTL layout correctly.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js ---
```
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
function: renderText
```
The `renderText` function is responsible for rendering text on the canvas. It needs to be alignment-aware for multi-line text and should handle RTL text correctly. The current implementation may not be handling RTL text properly, leading to the text going off-screen.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js ---
```
src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js
function: getRtlAdapter
function: overrideTextDirection
function: restoreTextDirection
```
The `getRtlAdapter` function provides an adapter for RTL layout transformations, which is crucial for handling RTL text. The `overrideTextDirection` and `restoreTextDirection` functions manage the text direction of the canvas context. These functions may need to be updated to ensure proper RTL support.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.legend.js ---
```
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
class: Legend
function: generateLabels
function: draw
```
The `Legend` class manages the legend's rendering and behavior. The `generateLabels` function generates the labels for the legend, and the `draw` function renders the legend on the canvas. These functions may need to be updated to handle RTL text correctly.

#### --- types/helpers/helpers.rtl.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file defines the interface for RTL adapters but does not contain any implementation details. The actual implementation is in `src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js`.
