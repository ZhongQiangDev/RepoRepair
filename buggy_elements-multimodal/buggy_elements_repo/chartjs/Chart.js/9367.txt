### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the LTTB decimation algorithm fails when running on a screen with a 250% scaling factor and an odd width. The error message indicates that the algorithm is trying to access a property 'y' of an undefined object, suggesting that the algorithm is attempting to process data points that do not exist or are out of bounds.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the calculation of indices and ranges within the LTTB algorithm. Specifically, the problem arises when the algorithm calculates `avgRangeStart`, `avgRangeEnd`, `avgRangeLength`, `rangeOffs`, and `rangeTo`. These calculations can result in negative values or values that exceed the length of the data array, leading to out-of-bounds errors. This issue is exacerbated by the combination of screen scaling and odd-width screens, which may affect how the bucket width is calculated and rounded.

```

The `lttbDecimation` function is directly involved in the LTTB algorithm and is likely where the issue occurs. The `function_7`, `function_6`, and `function_3` functions are also relevant as they manage the decimation process and may contribute to the problem by incorrectly setting up the data or parameters for the LTTB algorithm.
