### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the bars in the bar chart do not achieve 100% width as expected when `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` are set to `1`. Instead, there are empty spaces or borders between the bars, and the spacing is inconsistent between each bar.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the bar widths are calculated and positioned within the chart. When `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` are set to `1`, the bars should occupy the full width of their respective categories without any gaps. However, if the calculations for bar width or positioning are incorrect, this can result in unexpected spacing.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- src/controllers/controller.bar.js ---
This file contains the `BarController` class and several functions that are directly involved in calculating and rendering bar widths and positions. The following functions and class are relevant:

```
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
class: BarController
function: computeFitCategoryTraits
function: computeFlexCategoryTraits
function: parseArrayOrPrimitive
function: parseFloatBar
```

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---
This file contains functions related to layout management, which might indirectly affect the positioning of bars. However, the primary issue seems to be related to bar width calculation rather than layout management. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---
This file contains functions related to scale calculations, which might affect the positioning of bars. However, the primary issue seems to be related to bar width calculation rather than scale calculations. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/elements/element.bar.js ---
This file contains the `BarElement` class and functions related to rendering and positioning individual bars. The following functions and class are relevant:

```
src/elements/element.bar.js
class: BarElement
function: boundingRects
function: getBarBounds
function: inflateRect
function: parseBorderWidth
```

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.options.js ---
This file contains helper functions for resolving options and creating contexts, which might indirectly affect the configuration of bar widths. However, the primary issue seems to be related to bar width calculation rather than option resolution. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
