### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the border thickness of the chart has increased since version 3.5.0, while the legend border thickness remains unchanged. The user previously used `borderWidth: 2`, which was suitable for their needs in version 3.4.1, but now results in a thicker border in version 3.5.0. Reducing the `borderWidth` to `1` makes the border too thin and also affects the legend border, which the user does not want to change.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely lies in how the `borderWidth` is applied to the chart elements. In version 3.5.0, there might be a change in how the `borderWidth` is interpreted or applied, leading to a thicker border. The legend border is not affected, suggesting that the chart and legend borders are handled differently, and the change in version 3.5.0 only impacts the chart border.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.bar.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
class: BarController
```
The `BarController` class is responsible for managing bar chart functionalities, including rendering and updating bar properties. The issue might be related to how the `borderWidth` is applied within this class.

#### --- src/core/core.defaults.js ---
```
src/core/core.defaults.js
class: Defaults
```
The `Defaults` class manages default configurations for chart elements, including `borderWidth`. The change in border thickness might be related to a modification in the default settings or how these defaults are applied.

#### --- src/elements/element.bar.js ---
```
src/elements/element.bar.js
class: BarElement
function: parseBorderWidth
function: parseBorderRadius
function: boundingRects
```
The `BarElement` class and related functions handle the rendering and border properties of bars. The `parseBorderWidth` function specifically deals with border width calculations, which could be the source of the issue.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to canvas operations like drawing and clearing, but they do not directly handle border width properties.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.legend.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions and classes in this file are related to the legend, which is not affected by the issue. The legend border remains unchanged, so this file is not relevant to the problem.
