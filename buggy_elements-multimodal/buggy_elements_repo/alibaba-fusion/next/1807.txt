### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the automatic addition of `title` attributes to `Menu.Item` components, which leads to issues such as:
- Violation of WCAG guidelines when `title` and `innerText` are identical.
- Unwanted hover tooltips for some users.
- Potential double hover tooltips when custom content is used within `Menu.Item`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the automatic setting of the `title` attribute in the `Item` class within `src/menu/view/item.jsx`. This automatic setting does not consider the specific conditions under which `title` should be added, leading to the aforementioned issues.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/menu/index.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/menu/view/create.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/menu/view/item.jsx`
```
src/menu/view/item.jsx
class: Item
```
The `Item` class is responsible for rendering menu items and likely sets the `title` attribute automatically. This is where the issue originates.

#### `src/menu/view/menu.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/menu/view/menu.jsx` (repeated)
