### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Transfer component currently does not support controlling the search functionality separately for the left and right panels. The user wants to retain the search box only on the left panel and hide it on the right panel.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the `showSearch` property in the Transfer component is a single boolean value that controls the visibility of the search box for both panels simultaneously. There is no mechanism to specify different search settings for the left and right panels independently.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

class: TransferPanel
```
The `TransferPanel` class is responsible for rendering individual panels (left and right). It has a `showSearch` property that controls the visibility of the search box. To support separate search controls for each panel, this class needs to be modified to accept and handle separate search settings.

#### --- src/transfer/view/transfer.jsx ---
```
file: src/transfer/view/transfer.jsx
class: Transfer
```
The `Transfer` class is the main component that manages the transfer interface. It currently uses a single `showSearch` property for both panels. This class needs to be updated to support separate search settings for the left and right panels.

#### --- types/transfer/index.d.ts ---
```
file: types/transfer/index.d.ts
function: TransferProps
```
The `TransferProps` interface defines the properties accepted by the `Transfer` component. To support separate search controls, this interface needs to be updated to include properties for controlling the search functionality of each panel independently.
