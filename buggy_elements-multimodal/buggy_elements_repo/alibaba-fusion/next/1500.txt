### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using both `fixedHeader` and `resizable` features together in the table, clicking the filter button causes the header to display abnormally. The screenshot shows that the header appears misaligned or distorted after the filter button is clicked.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from a conflict between the fixed header functionality and the resizing mechanism. When the filter button is clicked, the header's layout may not be recalculated correctly, leading to misalignment. This could be due to improper handling of the header's dimensions or positioning when the filter dropdown is opened.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/table/base.jsx`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/table/fixed.jsx`
```
file: src/table/fixed.jsx
function: fixed
class: FixedTable
```

The `fixed` function and `FixedTable` class are responsible for implementing the fixed header functionality. The issue might be related to how the header's size is adjusted in the `adjustFixedHeaderSize` method or how scroll events are handled in the `onScroll` method.

#### `src/table/base/filter.jsx`
```
file: src/table/base/filter.jsx
class: Filter
```

The `Filter` class manages the filter dropdown and its visibility. The issue might be related to how the filter dropdown interacts with the header when it is opened, potentially affecting the header's layout.

#### `src/table/base/header.jsx`
```
file: src/table/base/header.jsx
class: Header
```

The `Header` class renders the table header and includes elements for sorting, filtering, and resizing. The issue might be related to how the header is rendered or how its dimensions are managed when the filter dropdown is opened.

#### `src/table/fixed/header.jsx`
```
file: src/table/fixed/header.jsx
class: FixedHeader
```

The `FixedHeader` class renders the fixed header and interacts with the parent context to manage its position. The issue might be related to how the fixed header's dimensions are managed or how it is synchronized with the parent component when the filter dropdown is opened.
