### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the user wants to customize the content of a cell in the header of a table, specifically to include a "全选" (Select All) checkbox. The provided image shows a table header with a checkbox that is not currently functioning as expected. The issue seems to be that the checkbox is not properly integrated into the header cell, and the user wants to ensure that it works correctly for selecting all rows.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior likely stems from the following:

- The `Header` component does not currently support custom cell content for header cells.
- The `Cell` component, which is used to render cells, may not be properly configured to handle custom content in the header.
- The `SelectionRow` component, which handles row selection, may not be properly integrated with the header checkbox.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/table/base.jsx`

This file contains the `Table` class, which is the main component for the table. It includes various props and methods for configuring the table, including `rowSelection` for row selection. However, it does not directly handle the rendering of the header or cells.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/table/base/body.jsx`

This file contains the `Body` class, which renders the main content area of the table. It does not handle the header or custom cell content in the header.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/table/base/cell.jsx`

This file contains the `Cell` class, which renders individual cells. It supports custom content through the `cell` prop, but it is not specifically designed for header cells.

```
src/table/base/cell.jsx
class: Cell
```

#### `src/table/base/header.jsx`

This file contains the `Header` class, which renders the table header. It maps over the `columns` prop to generate header cells but does not currently support custom cell content.

```
src/table/base/header.jsx
class: Header
```

#### `src/table/selection/row.jsx`

This file contains the `SelectionRow` class, which handles row selection. It does not directly handle the header checkbox but is relevant for ensuring that the "Select All" checkbox functions correctly.

```
src/table/selection/row.jsx
class: SelectionRow
```
