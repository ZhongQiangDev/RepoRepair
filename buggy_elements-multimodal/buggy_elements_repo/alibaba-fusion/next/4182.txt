### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when the `popupProps` prop with `v2: true` is used in the `CascaderSelect` component, an error occurs: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getInstance')`. This suggests that there is a problem with the initialization or usage of the `Popup` component when `v2` is enabled.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error message `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getInstance')` indicates that somewhere in the code, an attempt is made to access a property `getInstance` on a `null` object. This likely means that the `Popup` component is not being initialized correctly or is not available when `v2` is set to `true`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx ---
```
src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx
class: CascaderSelect
```
The `CascaderSelect` class is where the `popupProps` prop is used. It is likely that the issue lies in how the `popupProps` are being passed down to the `Popup` component.

#### --- src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx ---
```
src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx
function: function_1
```
This file contains the `Popup` component that is likely being used when `v2` is set to `true`. The error might be occurring here if the `Popup` component is not properly initialized or if there is an issue with the `getInstance` method.

#### --- src/cascader/cascader.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file does not seem directly related to the `popupProps` or the `Popup` component.

#### --- src/cascader/item.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file does not seem directly related to the `popupProps` or the `Popup` component.

#### --- src/cascader-select/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file does not seem directly related to the `popupProps` or the `Popup` component.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx`
   - `class: CascaderSelect`

2. `src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx`
   - `function: function_1`

These two files are the most likely places where the issue is occurring. The `CascaderSelect` class is where the `popupProps` are being used, and the `popup-v2.jsx` file contains the `Popup` component that is likely causing the error when `v2` is set to `true`.
