### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when the content of the tabs exceeds the available space, the tabs do not support scrolling via dragging or keyboard navigation. This makes it inconvenient for users to access tabs that are not immediately visible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the implementation of the `slide` mode for handling tab overflow. The current implementation may not include the necessary logic to enable dragging or keyboard navigation for scrolling through the tabs. This could be due to missing event handlers or CSS properties that facilitate such interactions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/tab/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- docs/tab/theme/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/tab/tab.jsx ---
```
src/tab/tab.jsx
class: Tab
```
The `Tab` class manages the overall tab interface and handles user interactions. It includes properties like `excessMode` which determines how excess tabs are handled. However, it does not directly handle the scrolling behavior.

#### --- src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx ---
```
src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx
class: Nav
```
The `Nav` class is responsible for rendering the tab navigation system and handling tab overflow. It includes methods like `setOffset` for adjusting the scroll position of tabs and `renderTabList` for generating tab elements. This class is likely where the scrolling behavior should be implemented.

#### --- src/tab/tabs/tab-item.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/tab/tab.jsx
class: Tab
```
2. ```
src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx
class: Nav
```

These two locations are most relevant to the issue. The `Tab` class manages the overall tab interface, while the `Nav` class handles the specific rendering and behavior of the tab navigation, including overflow scenarios. The `Nav` class is where the scrolling behavior should be implemented to support dragging and keyboard navigation.
