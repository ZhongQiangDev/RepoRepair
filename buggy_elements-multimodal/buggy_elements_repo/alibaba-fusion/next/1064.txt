### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description states that the `Field` component should not modify the input data. However, the image provided shows that the `Field` class directly assigns the `options.values` to `this.values` without creating a copy. This means that any changes made to `this.values` within the `Field` class will also modify the original `options.values`, which is not the desired behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the `Field` class is directly assigning the `options.values` object to `this.values` without creating a deep copy. As a result, any modifications to `this.values` will also affect the original `options.values` object. To fix this, `this.values` should be initialized with a deep copy of `options.values` to ensure that the original data remains unchanged.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/field/index.js`
This file contains the `Field` class, which is directly related to the problem. The `Field` class is where the issue of modifying the input data occurs. Specifically, the line `this.values = options.values || {};` needs to be fixed to create a deep copy of `options.values`.

```
src/field/index.js
class: Field
```

#### `es/field/index.js`
This file contains the `function_1` which describes the `Field` class. Since the `Field` class is the source of the problem, this file is also relevant.

```
es/field/index.js
function: function_1
```

#### `lib/field/index.js`
This file contains the `function_2` which is another description of the `Field` class. Similar to the previous file, this file is relevant because it describes the `Field` class.

```
lib/field/index.js
function: function_2
```

#### `es/field/utils.js`
This file contains utility functions that are used by the `Field` class. However, none of these functions directly relate to the issue of modifying the input data. Therefore, this file does not contain relevant functions or classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/field/utils.js`
Similar to the previous file, this file contains utility functions used by the `Field` class. None of these functions directly relate to the issue of modifying the input data.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
