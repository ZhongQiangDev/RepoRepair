### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when using the `NumberPicker` component with a `defaultValue` of `4.02`, a `step` of `0.01`, and a `precision` of `2`, clicking the `+` button results in the value being displayed as `4.029999999999999` instead of the expected `4.03`. This is due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the way JavaScript handles floating-point arithmetic. When adding `4.02` and `0.01`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the limitations of binary floating-point representation. This results in a value like `4.029999999999999`, which is then displayed by the `NumberPicker`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/number-picker/index.jsx`

This file contains the `NumberPicker` class, which is directly related to the issue described. The class handles the increment and decrement of values, and it needs to ensure that the displayed value is correctly rounded to the specified precision.

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

#### `src/util/object.js`

This file contains utility functions that do not seem directly related to the floating-point arithmetic issue. None of the functions listed (`each`, `function_7`, `isArrayLike`, `isPlainObject`, `isPromise`, `pickAttrsWith`, `pickOthers`, `shallowEqual`, `typeOf`) are directly involved in handling numerical values or precision.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/validate/rules/format.js`

This file contains validation functions for different formats (`email`, `format`, `number`, `tel`, `url`). While the `number` function validates if a value is a valid number, it does not handle the precision or rounding of floating-point numbers.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/validate/rules/size.js`

This file contains the `size` function, which validates the size of a value against a specified range. It does not handle the precision or rounding of floating-point numbers.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The only relevant file is `src/number-picker/index.jsx`, which contains the `NumberPicker` class. The class needs to be inspected and potentially edited to ensure that the value is correctly rounded to the specified precision when incrementing or decrementing.
