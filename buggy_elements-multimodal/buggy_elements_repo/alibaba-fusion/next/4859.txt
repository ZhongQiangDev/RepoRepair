### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when using virtual scrolling in the `CascaderSelect` component, the background color of the menu items appears abnormal. The screenshot shows that the background color of the menu items is not consistent, which suggests a rendering or styling issue related to the virtual scrolling implementation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from how the `VirtualList` component handles the rendering of menu items when virtual scrolling is enabled. Virtual scrolling optimizes performance by only rendering the items that are visible in the viewport, but it may introduce issues with styling if the rendering logic does not correctly apply styles to the items.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/cascader/menu.tsx
```
components/cascader/menu.tsx
class: CascaderMenu
```
The `CascaderMenu` class is responsible for rendering the menu items and managing the virtual scrolling behavior when `useVirtual` is true. The issue might be related to how the `VirtualList` component is used within this class.

#### components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx
```
components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx
class: CascaderSelect
```
The `CascaderSelect` class manages the overall state and behavior of the cascader select component. It passes the `useVirtual` prop to the `CascaderMenu` component, which enables virtual scrolling. However, this file itself does not directly handle the rendering of menu items.

#### components/virtual-list/virtual-list.jsx
```
components/virtual-list/virtual-list.jsx
class: VirtualList
```
The `VirtualList` class is responsible for the virtual scrolling implementation. The issue might be related to how this class calculates and renders the visible items, potentially affecting the styling of the menu items.
