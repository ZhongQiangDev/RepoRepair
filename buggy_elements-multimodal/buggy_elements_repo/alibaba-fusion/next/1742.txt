### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the user wants an API to remove the title information from the `Cascader` component. The image shows a tooltip-like element with a title ("在南天门配置商品遇到问题反馈") that the user wants to remove.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The presence of the title information suggests that it is being rendered as part of the `Cascader` component's default behavior. The user wants an API to control whether this title is displayed or not. This likely involves modifying the rendering logic of the `Cascader` component to conditionally include or exclude the title based on a new prop.

The `Cascader` class is the primary component responsible for rendering the cascading dropdown. To address the issue, we need to add a new prop (e.g., `showTitle`) to control the display of the title. This prop should be checked in the rendering logic to conditionally include or exclude the title.

#### --- types/cascader/index.d.ts ---
```
file: types/cascader/index.d.ts
function: CascaderProps
```

The `CascaderProps` interface should be updated to include the new `showTitle` prop to ensure type safety and proper documentation.
