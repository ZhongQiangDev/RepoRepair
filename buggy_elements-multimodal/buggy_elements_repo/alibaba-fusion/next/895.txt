### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that in `iconOnly` mode, navigation items without an icon are displaying a blank space instead of being hidden or properly styled. This is evident from the screenshot where the `PopupItem` without an icon shows an empty space instead of being omitted or styled consistently.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `iconOnly` mode is handled in the rendering logic of the `PopupItem` and `Item` components. When `iconOnly` is true, the components should either hide the label text or ensure that items without icons are not rendered in a way that creates blank spaces.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/nav/group.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Group` component does not directly handle the rendering of individual items, so it is not directly relevant to the issue.

#### src/nav/item.jsx
```
src/nav/item.jsx
class: Item
```
The `Item` class is responsible for rendering individual navigation items. It handles the `iconOnly` context and the rendering of the `icon` and `children` props. If `iconOnly` is true and no icon is provided, it currently renders a placeholder span, which might be causing the blank space issue.

#### src/nav/nav.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Nav` class is the main navigation component but does not directly handle the rendering of individual items. It passes down context values like `iconOnly`, but the actual rendering logic is handled by child components.

#### src/nav/popup-item.jsx
```
src/nav/popup-item.jsx
class: PopupItem
```
The `PopupItem` class is responsible for rendering items that trigger a popup menu. Similar to the `Item` class, it handles the `iconOnly` context and the rendering of the `icon` and `label` props. If `iconOnly` is true and no icon is provided, it might be rendering a placeholder that causes the blank space.

#### types/nav/index.d.ts
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not include any implementation details that would directly cause the issue.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `src/nav/item.jsx`
   - class: `Item`

2. `src/nav/popup-item.jsx`
   - class: `PopupItem`

These two classes are directly responsible for rendering navigation items and handling the `iconOnly` mode, so they are the most relevant locations to inspect and potentially edit to fix the issue.
