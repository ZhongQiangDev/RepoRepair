### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `CascaderSelect` component modifies the properties of the objects passed to it as `dataSource`, which leads to an error when using `immer` (a library for immutable state management). The error message indicates that the component is trying to add a property to an object that is not extensible, which is likely due to the component modifying the `dataSource` objects directly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the `Cascader` component (or a related function) directly modifying the `dataSource` objects passed to it. This modification is problematic because it alters the original objects, which can lead to issues when using libraries like `immer` that expect objects to remain immutable.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/cascader/cascader.jsx`

This file contains the `Cascader` class and the `flatDataSource` function, which are likely involved in the issue.

- **Class `Cascader`**: This class manages the state and rendering of the cascader component. It is possible that the class directly modifies the `dataSource` objects, leading to the error.
- **Function `function_1` (`flatDataSource`)**: This function recursively traverses the `dataSource` and creates mappings. It updates the `value` property of each item, which could be the source of the issue.

class: Cascader

#### `src/cascader/index.jsx`

This file contains a function that handles deprecated props. It does not seem directly related to the issue of modifying `dataSource` objects.

#### `src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx`

This file contains the `CascaderSelect` class and the `normalizeValue` function. The `CascaderSelect` class extends the basic Select component and manages the state of the selected value, search functionality, and dropdown visibility. It does not seem directly related to the issue of modifying `dataSource` objects.

### Summary

The relevant locations that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

````
src/cascader/cascader.jsx
class: Cascader
function: function_1
````

These locations should be examined to ensure that the `dataSource` objects are not being modified directly. Instead, the component should create new objects or use immutable data structures to avoid altering the original objects.
