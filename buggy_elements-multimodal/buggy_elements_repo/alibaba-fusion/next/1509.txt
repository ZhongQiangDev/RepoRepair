### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that the `popupContainer` configuration in `ConfigProvider` does not affect the `Dialog` component. This results in the `Dialog` not being rendered in the specified container, causing layout issues as shown in the image. The `Dialog` appears to overlap with other elements, indicating that it is not being positioned correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the `Dialog` component not respecting the `popupContainer` configuration provided by `ConfigProvider`. This configuration is typically used to specify a custom container for rendering overlay components like `Dialog`, `Dropdown`, etc. If the `Dialog` component does not properly inherit or apply this configuration, it will render in the default container (usually `document.body`), leading to the observed layout problems.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/dialog/dialog.jsx`

This file contains the `Dialog` component, which is directly related to the issue. The `Dialog` component should respect the `popupContainer` configuration from `ConfigProvider`. However, there is no mention of `popupContainer` in the attributes or code description, indicating that the `Dialog` component might not be set up to handle this configuration.

```
src/dialog/dialog.jsx
class: Dialog
```

#### `src/dialog/inner.jsx`

This file contains the `Inner` class, which is a part of the `Dialog` component. However, there is no indication that this class is directly related to the `popupContainer` configuration.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/overlay/overlay.jsx`

This file contains the `Overlay` class, which is used by the `Dialog` component for positioning and masking. The `Overlay` class has a `container` attribute that specifies where the overlay should be rendered. This attribute could be used to implement the `popupContainer` configuration.

```
src/overlay/overlay.jsx
class: Overlay
```

#### `src/overlay/popup.jsx`

This file contains the `Popup` class, which is not directly related to the `Dialog` component. The `Popup` class is used for different types of overlays and does not seem to be involved in the `Dialog`'s rendering.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/overlay/position.jsx`

This file contains the `Position` class, which is used for positioning elements. While it is related to positioning, it does not directly handle the `popupContainer` configuration.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
