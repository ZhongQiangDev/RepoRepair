### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a node in the tree component is selected, the `selected` property in the `extra` parameter toggles correctly on the first click but does not change on subsequent clicks. Additionally, the CSS styles do not update accordingly, making it impossible to visually distinguish between selected and unselected states.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `selected` state is being managed and updated within the tree component. Specifically, the problem could be related to:
- Incorrect handling of the `selectedKeys` or `checkedKeys` in the `Tree` component.
- The `onSelect` event not properly updating the `selected` state.
- CSS styles not being applied correctly based on the `selected` state.
