### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the left arrow (previous arrow) is disabled when `slidesToShow > slidesCount`, `infinite={false}`, and `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`. This means that the left arrow should be enabled to allow navigation to the previous slide, but it is currently disabled.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the logic that determines whether the navigation arrows should be enabled or disabled. Specifically, the conditions under which the left arrow is disabled may not be correctly handling the scenario where `slidesToShow > slidesCount`, `infinite={false}`, and `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/slider/slider.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx ---
```
src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx
class: Arrow
```
The `Arrow` class is responsible for rendering the navigation arrows and determining their enabled/disabled state. The `isDisabled` static method likely contains the logic that needs to be reviewed and potentially fixed.

#### --- src/slider/slick/inner-slider.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/slider/slick/mixins/event-handlers.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/slider/slick/mixins/helpers.js ---
```
src/slider/slick/mixins/helpers.js
function: canGoNext
```
The `canGoNext` function checks if the slider can move to the next slide. Although it is named `canGoNext`, it might contain logic that affects the previous arrow's state as well, especially when `infinite` is false.
