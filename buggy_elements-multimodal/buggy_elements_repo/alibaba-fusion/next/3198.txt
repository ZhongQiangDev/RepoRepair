### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that setting `timePanelProps.defaultValue` results in the display of "Invalid Date". This suggests that the default value provided is not being correctly parsed or validated, leading to an invalid date being shown.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `defaultValue` is being processed and validated within the date picker component. Specifically, the `timePanelProps.defaultValue` might not be correctly formatted or validated, leading to an "Invalid Date" being displayed. This could be due to issues in the date parsing, validation, or formatting logic within the relevant functions or classes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/date-picker2/picker.jsx ---
This file contains several functions and a class that are relevant to date validation and formatting.

```
src/date-picker2/picker.jsx
function: checkAndRectify
function: checkDate
function: checkRangeDate
function: getInputValue
function: isValueChanged
class: Picker
```

- `checkAndRectify`: This function checks and rectifies date values, which could be relevant if the `defaultValue` is not being correctly processed.
- `checkDate`: This function validates individual date values, which could be relevant if the `defaultValue` is not being correctly parsed.
- `checkRangeDate`: This function validates date ranges, which could be relevant if the `defaultValue` is part of a date range.
- `getInputValue`: This function formats date values, which could be relevant if the `defaultValue` is not being correctly formatted.
- `isValueChanged`: This function checks if a value has changed, which could be relevant if the `defaultValue` is not being correctly compared.
- `Picker`: This class manages the overall state and behavior of the date picker, which could be relevant if the `defaultValue` is not being correctly handled.

#### --- src/date-picker2/util.js ---
This file contains utility functions that might be used for date manipulation.

```
src/date-picker2/util.js
function: mode2unit
function: setTime
function: switchInputType
```

- `mode2unit`: This function converts modes to units, which might not be directly relevant to the issue.
- `setTime`: This function sets time components, which could be relevant if the `defaultValue` involves time.
- `switchInputType`: This function switches input types, which might not be directly relevant to the issue.

#### --- src/date-picker2/panels/date-panel.jsx ---
This file contains the `DatePanel` class, which is responsible for rendering the date panel.

```
src/date-picker2/panels/date-panel.jsx
class: DatePanel
```

- `DatePanel`: This class handles date selection and could be relevant if the `defaultValue` is not being correctly handled within the date panel.

#### --- src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx ---
This file contains the `TimePanel` class, which is responsible for rendering the time panel.

```
src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx
class: TimePanel
```

- `TimePanel`: This class handles time selection and could be relevant if the `defaultValue` involves time and is not being correctly handled within the time panel.

#### --- src/time-picker2/panel.jsx ---
This file contains the `TimePickerPanel` class, which is responsible for rendering the time picker panel.

```
src/time-picker2/panel.jsx
class: TimePickerPanel
```

- `TimePickerPanel`: This class handles time selection and could be relevant if the `defaultValue` involves time and is not being correctly handled within the time picker panel.
