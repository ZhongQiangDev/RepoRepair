### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that some Select demo styles are too absolute, affecting the appearance of other demos. Specifically, the images show that the `margin-bottom` styles for `.next-select` are hardcoded to `8px` and `16px`, which may conflict with other styles and cause layout issues.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely due to the hardcoded `margin-bottom` values in the CSS for `.next-select`. These absolute values do not adapt to different contexts and can interfere with other styles, leading to inconsistent spacing between Select components in various demos.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/select/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- docs/select/theme/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/demo-helper/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/select/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/util/dom.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Relevant Files and Functions/Classes

Based on the analysis, the relevant files and functions/classes are:

```
docs/select/demo/combobox-basic.md
function: None
class: None

docs/select/demo/select-basic.md
function: None
class: None
```

The relevant CSS styles are located in the markdown files `combobox-basic.md` and `select-basic.md` within the `docs/select/demo` directory. These files contain the hardcoded `margin-bottom` values for `.next-select` that need to be inspected and potentially modified to resolve the issue.
