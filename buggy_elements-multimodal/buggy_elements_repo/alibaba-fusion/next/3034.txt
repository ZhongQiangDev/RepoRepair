### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `Upload` component, when using `itemRender`, does not support the delete functionality. Specifically, the user is unable to remove uploaded files when using the `itemRender` customization.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises because the `itemRender` customization does not properly include or handle the delete functionality. This could be due to missing or incorrect implementation of the `onRemove` callback or the absence of a delete button in the custom rendering.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/upload/card.jsx ---
```
src/upload/card.jsx
class: Card
```
The `Card` class is responsible for rendering the upload card and handling user interactions such as previewing, removing, and canceling uploads. The `onRemove` callback is mentioned as one of its attributes, which suggests it should handle file removal. If `itemRender` is used and does not include the delete functionality, this class might need to be inspected to ensure it properly handles `onRemove`.

#### --- src/upload/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to deprecation warnings, property transformations, and general upload handling but do not directly handle the `itemRender` customization or file removal.

#### --- src/upload/list.jsx ---
```
src/upload/list.jsx
class: List
```
The `List` class is responsible for displaying the list of uploaded files and handling file operations like removal. The `closable` attribute and `onRemove` callback are relevant here. If `itemRender` is used and does not include the delete functionality, this class might need to be inspected to ensure it properly handles `onRemove`.

#### --- src/upload/upload.jsx ---
```
src/upload/upload.jsx
class: Upload
```
The `Upload` class manages the overall upload functionality, including file selection, upload, and handling callbacks like `onRemove`. If `itemRender` is used and does not include the delete functionality, this class might need to be inspected to ensure it properly handles `onRemove`.

#### --- types/upload/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not directly handle the `itemRender` customization or file removal.
