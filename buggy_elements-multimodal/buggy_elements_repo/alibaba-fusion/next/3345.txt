### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that when there is no title in the dialog, the close button is positioned incorrectly, potentially overlapping with the dialog content. The image provided shows the close button overlapping with the text inside the dialog.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the way the close button is positioned within the dialog when there is no title. When a title is present, the close button is probably positioned relative to the title area. However, when there is no title, the positioning logic may not adjust correctly, causing the close button to overlap with the content.

#### --- docs/dialog/theme/index.jsx ---

#### --- src/dialog/dialog.jsx ---
```
src/dialog/dialog.jsx
class: Dialog
```
The `Dialog` class is responsible for rendering the dialog component and handling its properties, including the title and close button. The issue might be related to how the close button is positioned when the title is not present.

#### --- src/dialog/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/dialog/inner.jsx ---
```
src/dialog/inner.jsx
class: Inner
```
The `Inner` class is responsible for rendering the dialog's internal structure, including the header, body, footer, and close button. The `renderCloseLink` method likely handles the rendering of the close button, and it may need to be adjusted to account for the absence of a title.
