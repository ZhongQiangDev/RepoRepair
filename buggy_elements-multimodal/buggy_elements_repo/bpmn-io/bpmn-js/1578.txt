### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a Pool is copied and pasted, it results in duplicate Pool IDs. This causes issues when exporting and importing the BPMN diagram, as the XML contains duplicate IDs, which is not valid.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely related to how IDs are managed during the copy-paste operation. When a Pool is copied, the ID of the Pool should be regenerated to ensure uniqueness. However, it seems that the copied Pool retains the same ID as the original, leading to duplicate IDs in the XML when exported.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- lib/BaseModeler.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js ---
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
function: copyProperties
function: isLabel
function: removeProperties
function: setProperties
```
The `BpmnCopyPaste` function is responsible for managing the copying and pasting of BPMN elements. The `copyProperties` function might be involved in copying properties, including IDs, from the original element to the copied one. The `setProperties` function could be responsible for setting properties on the new element, which might include the ID.

#### --- lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js ---
```
lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
function: function_10
function: function_6
function: function_8
function: getPropertyNames
function: is
function: ModdleCopy
```
The `function_10` (`_copyId`) is specifically responsible for assigning IDs to elements. It checks if an ID is already assigned and claims it if not. This function might need to be modified to ensure that copied elements get new, unique IDs. The `ModdleCopy` function listens to events related to copying properties and might need to be adjusted to handle ID generation correctly.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/UnclaimIdBehavior.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/IdClaimHandler.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/IdClaimHandler.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: IdClaimHandler
```
The `IdClaimHandler` function and its methods (`function_2` and `function_3`) are responsible for claiming and unclaiming IDs. These functions might need to be involved in ensuring that when an element is copied, its ID is properly unclaimed and a new ID is claimed for the copied element.
