### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a Call Activity is transformed into an Expanded SubProcess, the shape does not resize appropriately, and the wrench menu options become limited, preventing the user from reverting the element back to a Call Activity. This leads to a "dead end" where the user cannot easily change the element type back.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from the following issues:

- **Incorrect Shape Resizing**: When transforming a Call Activity into an Expanded SubProcess, the shape's dimensions are not updated correctly. This could be due to a problem with the auto-resizing logic or the specific handling of SubProcess elements.
- **Limited Menu Options**: After the transformation, the wrench menu only shows limited options, such as "Event SubProcess," which suggests that the element's type or state is not being correctly updated or recognized by the menu logic.
- **Inability to Revert**: The inability to revert the element back to a Call Activity indicates that the transformation process might not be properly updating the element's metadata or type, leading to a state where the original type is lost.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/auto-resize/BpmnAutoResize.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
```

- `function_3`: This function creates BPMN elements based on the `elementType` and `attrs`. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how the SubProcess element is created or its properties are set.
- `function_4`: This function retrieves the default size for various BPMN elements. If the size for a SubProcess is not being set correctly, this function could be involved.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
function: function_6
function: function_7
function: function_8
```

- `function_6`: This function replaces elements in the BPMN diagram. If the replacement logic is not correctly updating the element type or properties, this function could be relevant.
- `function_7`: Similar to `function_6`, this function also handles element replacement and could be involved in the issue.
- `function_8`: Another function that handles element replacement and could be relevant if the replacement process is not updating the element correctly.

#### `lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js`

```
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
function: function_3
function: function_27
```

- `function_3`: This function generates replacement entries for a given element. If the menu options are not being correctly generated or filtered, this function could be relevant.
- `function_27`: This function creates a menu item for toggling the ad-hoc marker on a BPMN element. If the menu options are limited after the transformation, this function could be involved.

#### `lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js`

```
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
function: BpmnReplace
function: shouldToggleCollapsed
```

- `BpmnReplace`: This function handles the replacement of BPMN elements. If the replacement process is not correctly updating the element type or properties, this function could be relevant.
- `shouldToggleCollapsed`: This function evaluates whether an element should be toggled between collapsed and expanded states. If the state is not being correctly updated, this function could be involved.
