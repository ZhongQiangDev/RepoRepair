### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, it loses its properties such as Async Continuations and Job Configurations. This indicates that the properties are not being correctly transferred during the copy-paste operation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way properties are being copied and pasted between elements. Specifically, when an Intermediate Event is pasted as a Boundary Event, the properties that were set on the original Intermediate Event are not being retained. This suggests that the copying mechanism may not be correctly handling the transfer of these specific properties during the transformation from Intermediate Event to Boundary Event.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`

This file contains functions that handle the copying and pasting of BPMN elements. The `BpmnCopyPaste` function listens to events related to copying and pasting elements and uses `moddleCopy` to copy properties. The `copyPaste.pasteElement` event is particularly relevant because it creates a new business object and copies properties from the old business object to the new one. However, it may not be correctly handling the specific properties of Intermediate Events when pasting them as Boundary Events.

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
```

#### `lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js`

This file contains functions that handle the copying of properties between elements. The `function_6` function copies properties from a source element to a target element, and the `copyProperty` function handles the copying of individual properties. These functions may need to be inspected to ensure they correctly handle the properties of Intermediate Events when pasting them as Boundary Events.

```
lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
function: function_6
function: copyProperty
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js`

This file contains functions that handle the behavior of attaching events in a BPMN diagram. The `AttachEventBehavior` function checks if an intermediate event is being attached to a host shape and creates a new boundary event to replace it. This function may need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles the properties of the original intermediate event when creating the new boundary event.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
function: AttachEventBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js`

This file contains functions that handle the behavior of creating boundary events in a BPMN diagram. The `CreateBoundaryEventBehavior` function creates a new business object for a boundary event and sets its attributes. This function may need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles the properties of the original intermediate event when creating the new boundary event.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
function: CreateBoundaryEventBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js`

This file contains functions that handle the replacement of BPMN elements in a diagram. The `BpmnReplace` function replaces an existing element with a new one while preserving relevant properties. This function may need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles the properties of Intermediate Events when replacing them with Boundary Events.

```
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
function: BpmnReplace
```

### Summary

The following files and functions should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste

lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
function: function_6
function: copyProperty

lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
function: AttachEventBehavior

lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
function: CreateBoundaryEventBehavior

lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
function: BpmnReplace
```
