### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that users cannot easily connect two tasks center-to-center in the BPMN diagram editor after the introduction of connection previews and grid snapping. The connection process is hindered, and the expected center-to-center snapping is missing, making it difficult to create connections between tasks as smoothly as before.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the changes in the snapping behavior and connection previews. Specifically, the grid snapping mechanism may be interfering with the center-to-center alignment of tasks when creating connections. The grid snapping might be prioritizing grid alignment over the center-to-center snapping, leading to the observed difficulty in connecting tasks.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js ---
This file contains the `BpmnGridSnapping` function, which handles grid snapping for certain BPMN elements. The issue described is related to grid snapping interfering with center-to-center connections. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js
function: BpmnGridSnapping
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js ---
This file contains functions related to creating BPMN elements and shapes. While it is important for the overall BPMN model, it does not directly handle the snapping or connection behavior. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js ---
This file contains functions related to updating flow node references. While it is important for managing flow node connections, it does not directly handle the snapping or connection previews. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js ---
This file likely contains functions related to snapping behavior specifically for connecting BPMN elements. Given the issue described, this file is highly relevant as it may contain the logic for connection previews and snapping that is causing the problem.
