### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `DataObjectReference` replace menu only contains the collection marker, making it feel empty and out of place. The suggestion is to allow switching between `DataObjectReference` and `DataStoreReference` in the replace menu to ensure it is always populated with relevant options.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the current implementation of the replace menu for `DataObjectReference` elements. The menu is not configured to include options for switching to `DataStoreReference`, and vice versa. This limitation results in an underpopulated menu that does not provide users with the necessary flexibility.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js ---
```
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
function: function_3
function: function_23
```

- `function_3`: This function is responsible for generating replacement options for a given BPMN element. It filters and formats the options based on the element type. To address the issue, this function needs to be modified to include options for switching between `DataObjectReference` and `DataStoreReference`.

- `function_23`: This function creates a menu item for toggling the `isCollection` property of a `DataObjectReference`. To ensure the menu is always populated, this function should be extended or modified to include options for switching to `DataStoreReference`.

#### --- lib/features/popup-menu/util/TypeUtil.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js ---
```
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
function: BpmnReplace
```

- `BpmnReplace`: This function is responsible for replacing BPMN elements in the diagram. It handles various scenarios, including replacing sub-processes, pools, and activities. To support switching between `DataObjectReference` and `DataStoreReference`, this function needs to be updated to handle the specific properties and behaviors of these elements during the replacement process.
