### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the label of a Task is removed, the `di.label` property still exists with a value of `null`. This causes issues with other tools, such as linting, because the property should not exist at all when the label is removed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the way the label property is being handled when it is cleared. Specifically, the code responsible for updating or removing the label property from the `di` object is not correctly deleting the property when the label is set to an empty value. Instead, it is setting the property to `null`, which leaves the property in the object.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js ---
This file contains functions that are directly related to label editing and updating. The function `function_11` is particularly relevant because it handles the updating of labels and bounds for elements.

```
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
function: function_11
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---
This file contains functions related to updating various aspects of BPMN elements, including labels. The function `function_28` is relevant because it deals with retrieving or creating labels for diagram interchange elements.

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_28
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js ---
This file contains functions for updating properties of moddle elements. While it does not directly handle label removal, it might be involved in the process of updating properties that could affect labels.

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js ---
This file contains functions for updating properties of BPMN elements. The function `function_2` is relevant because it updates properties on an element's `businessObject`, which could include label properties.

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
function: function_2
```

#### --- lib/util/LabelUtil.js ---
This file contains utility functions related to labels. While these functions are more about calculating positions and bounds, they might be indirectly involved in the label removal process.

```
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
function: hasExternalLabel
function: isLabelExternal
```
