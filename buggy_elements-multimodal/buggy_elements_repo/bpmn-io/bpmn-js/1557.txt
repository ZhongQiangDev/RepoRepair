### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that an error is thrown when attempting to morph a `DataStoreReference` to a `DataObjectReference` outside of a pool. The error message indicates that the function `updateDiParent` is trying to access a property `get` on an undefined object, suggesting that the function is not handling the case where the `DataStoreReference` is outside of a pool correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the error appears to be related to the `updateDiParent` function in the `BpmnUpdater` class. When the `DataStoreReference` is outside of a pool, the function is not correctly handling the parent reference, leading to an attempt to access a property on an undefined object. This suggests that the function may not be properly checking for the existence of a valid parent or may not be handling the specific case of a `DataStoreReference` outside of a pool.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---
```
file: lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: updateDiParent
function: updateParent
```

The `updateDiParent` function is directly involved in the error as it is trying to access a property on an undefined object. The `updateParent` function is also relevant as it calls `updateDiParent` and may need to be modified to handle the specific case of a `DataStoreReference` outside of a pool.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `ElementFactory` class and its functions are not directly involved in the error related to morphing a `DataStoreReference` to a `DataObjectReference`.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/DataStoreBehavior.js ---
```
file: lib/features/modeling/behavior/DataStoreBehavior.js
function: DataStoreBehavior
```

The `DataStoreBehavior` function is relevant as it handles the specific behavior of `DataStoreReference` elements. It may need to be modified to ensure that the `DataStoreReference` is properly handled when it is outside of a pool.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateSemanticParentHandler.js ---
```
file: lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateSemanticParentHandler.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
```

The `function_2` and `function_3` functions are relevant as they handle updating the semantic and DI parents of a data store object. They may need to be modified to handle the specific case of a `DataStoreReference` outside of a pool.

#### --- lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `BpmnRules` class and its functions are not directly involved in the error related to morphing a `DataStoreReference` to a `DataObjectReference`.
