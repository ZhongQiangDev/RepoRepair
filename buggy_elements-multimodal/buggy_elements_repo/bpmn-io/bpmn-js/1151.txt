### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when users copy and paste the contents of a participant in a BPMN diagram, the labels associated with the elements (e.g., "A" and "B" in the video) are not preserved. Instead, the diagram is missing these labels after the paste operation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way labels are handled during the copy and paste process. Specifically, the labels may not be correctly identified, copied, or pasted along with their associated elements. This could be due to:

- The copy operation not capturing the label elements or their properties.
- The paste operation not correctly reconstructing the labels or associating them with the pasted elements.
- The label handling logic not being robust enough to handle all scenarios, especially when dealing with participant contents.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js ---
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
function: isLabel
```
The `BpmnCopyPaste` function manages the copying and pasting of BPMN elements, and the `isLabel` function checks if an element is a label. Both are directly relevant to the issue.

#### --- lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js ---
```
lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
function: function_6
function: function_8
```
The `function_6` and `function_8` functions handle the copying of properties between elements, which is relevant to ensuring that label properties are correctly copied.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
```
The `function_2` and `function_3` functions are responsible for creating elements, including labels, which is relevant to ensuring that labels are correctly created during the paste operation.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
function: LabelBehavior
```
The `LabelBehavior` function manages label operations, including label creation and updates, which is relevant to ensuring that labels are correctly handled during copy and paste.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to updating properties of elements, but they do not directly handle the copy and paste operations or label management.
