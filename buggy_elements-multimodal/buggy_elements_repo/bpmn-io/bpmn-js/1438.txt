### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the names of message elements on message flows are not being rendered in the BPMN diagram. The provided example diagram shows message flows with icons but no accompanying text labels for the message names.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the rendering logic for message flows. Specifically, the renderer may not be correctly handling the rendering of labels for message elements. This could be due to missing or incorrect logic for determining when and how to render the message names as labels on the message flows.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js ---
This file contains the core rendering logic for BPMN elements, including message flows. The following functions are relevant:

```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
class: BpmnRenderer
function: function_85
```

- `function_85` (`drawConnection`): This function is responsible for rendering connection elements, including message flows. It may need to be modified to include logic for rendering message names as labels.

#### --- lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js ---
This file contains logic for label editing and positioning. The following functions are relevant:

```
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
function: function_10
function: function_11
function: function_9
```

- `function_10` (`getEditingBBox`): This function calculates the bounding box for label editing. It may need to be adjusted to handle message flow labels.
- `function_11` (`updateLabel`): This function updates labels and bounds. It may need to be extended to support message flow labels.
- `function_9` (`activate`): This function prepares the context for direct label editing. It may need to include logic for message flow labels.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---
This file contains logic for updating BPMN elements and their properties. The following functions are relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_28
```

- `function_28` (`function_28`): This function retrieves or creates a label for a diagram interchange element. It may need to be extended to handle message flow labels.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js ---
This file contains behavior for managing labels during modeling operations. The following function is relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
function: LabelBehavior
```

- `LabelBehavior`: This class manages external labels during various modeling commands. It may need to include logic for handling message flow labels.

#### --- lib/util/LabelUtil.js ---
This file contains utility functions for label calculations. The following functions are relevant:

```
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
function: getExternalLabelBounds
function: getExternalLabelMid
function: getFlowLabelPosition
```

- `getExternalLabelBounds`: This function calculates the bounds for external labels. It may need to be adjusted to handle message flow labels.
- `getExternalLabelMid`: This function calculates the midpoint for external labels. It may need to be extended to support message flow labels.
- `getFlowLabelPosition`: This function calculates the position for flow labels. It may need to be modified to handle message flow labels.
