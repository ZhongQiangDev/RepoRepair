### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a Boundary Event is copied along with the object it is attached to (in this case, a task), the copied Boundary Event does not remain attached to the copied task. Instead, it becomes detached, which is not the expected behavior. The expected behavior is for the copied Boundary Event to be automatically attached to the copied task.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the copy-paste functionality not correctly handling the attachment relationship between the Boundary Event and the task. Specifically, when the Boundary Event is copied, its `attachedToRef` property, which references the task it is attached to, is not being properly copied or resolved during the paste operation. This results in the Boundary Event losing its attachment to the task after the paste.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`

This file contains the core logic for copying and pasting BPMN elements, which is directly related to the issue described. The following functions are relevant:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
```

The `BpmnCopyPaste` function handles the copying and pasting of BPMN elements. Specifically, the `copyPaste.pasteElement` event handler is responsible for creating a new business object and copying properties from the old business object to the new one. It also resolves references using the `resolveReferences` helper function. However, it seems that the `attachedToRef` property of the Boundary Event is not being correctly resolved or copied during the paste operation.

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js`

This file contains functions for creating BPMN elements, but it does not directly handle the copy-paste functionality. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js`

This file contains behavior for attaching events to shapes, but it does not handle the copy-paste functionality. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js`

This file contains behavior for creating boundary events, but it does not handle the copy-paste functionality. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js`

This file contains behavior for detaching events from shapes, but it does not handle the copy-paste functionality. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The primary location that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
```

Specifically, the `copyPaste.pasteElement` event handler and the `resolveReferences` helper function should be examined to ensure that the `attachedToRef` property of the Boundary Event is correctly copied and resolved during the paste operation.
