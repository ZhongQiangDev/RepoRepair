### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when setting the color of elements with external labels using the `modeling.setColor` API, the external label is set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color. This is different from the behavior for embedded labels, where the "stroke" color is used. This discrepancy leads to a UX concern due to the light color of the external label.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `setColor` function handles the color assignment for external labels. Specifically, the function may not be correctly identifying or applying the "stroke" color to external labels, instead defaulting to the "fill" color. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the color assignment logic or a lack of proper handling for external labels in the `setColor` function.
