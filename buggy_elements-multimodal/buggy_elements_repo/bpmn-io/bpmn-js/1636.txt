### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a `call activity` is morphed into an `expanded subprocess`, the resulting subprocess does not include a start event, unlike when a `task` is morphed into an `expanded subprocess`. This results in a confusing user experience because the subprocess appears as a simple rectangle without any indication of a start point.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the morphing logic that handles the transformation of BPMN elements. Specifically, the logic responsible for creating an `expanded subprocess` from a `call activity` does not include the step to add a start event, whereas the logic for creating an `expanded subprocess` from a `task` does include this step. This discrepancy suggests that the morphing process for `call activities` is missing the necessary steps to properly initialize an `expanded subprocess`.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_27
```
The `function_27` function is responsible for updating connection details in a BPMN diagram. While it does not directly handle the morphing of elements, it could be indirectly involved if the morphing process involves updating connections. However, it does not seem directly relevant to the issue of adding a start event to an expanded subprocess.

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_25
```
The `function_25` function updates the semantic parent of a business object. This function could be relevant if the morphing process involves updating the parent of the new subprocess. However, it does not directly handle the addition of a start event.

```

lib/features/modeling/ElementFactory.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` function creates BPMN elements based on the provided `elementType` and `attrs`. This function could be relevant if the morphing process involves creating a new subprocess element. However, it does not directly handle the addition of a start event.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js
function: SubProcessStartEventBehavior
```
The `SubProcessStartEventBehavior` function is designed to automatically add a start event to an expanded subprocess. This function is directly relevant to the issue of adding a start event to an expanded subprocess. It listens for events related to the creation and replacement of shapes and adds a start event when an expanded subprocess is created or a task is replaced with an expanded subprocess.
