### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when toggling between "Parallel" and "Sequential" for a multi-instance loop in a BPMN diagram, the XML label does not update as expected. Specifically, the XML should reflect `<bpmn:multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics />` for a parallel loop and `<bpmn:multiInstanceLoopCharacteristics isSequential="true" />` for a sequential loop. However, the XML label remains unchanged after toggling.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the toggle action for switching between parallel and sequential modes is not properly updating the underlying BPMN model. This could be due to a problem in the logic that handles the toggle action or in the code responsible for updating the XML representation of the BPMN model.

The function `_getLoopEntries` is relevant because it handles the creation of menu entries for configuring loop characteristics, including toggling between parallel and sequential modes. This function might be responsible for updating the BPMN model when the toggle action is performed.
