### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the background color specified for the checked radio button is being applied to all radio buttons instead of just the one that is checked. This means the styling intended for the checked state is incorrectly affecting all radio buttons.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the background color is being applied in the styling logic. The background color for the checked state should only be applied when the `checked` property is true for a specific radio button. If the background color is being applied without checking the `checked` state, it will affect all radio buttons.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js`

This file contains the main `RadioButton` component. The issue might be in how the `checked` state is being handled and passed to the styled components.

```
src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js`

This file contains the styled components for the `RadioButton`. The issue might be in the styling logic where the background color is applied.

```
src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js
function: function_13
function: function_15
```

#### `src/js/themes/base.js`

This file contains the base theme configuration. It is unlikely to be directly related to the issue since it deals with general theme configurations rather than specific component styling.

```
src/js/themes/base.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
function: function_1

src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js
function: function_13
function: function_15
```

These functions are likely where the issue lies. `function_1` in `RadioButton.js` manages the component's state and props, while `function_13` and `function_15` in `StyledRadioButton.js` handle the styling logic for the background color and checked state.
