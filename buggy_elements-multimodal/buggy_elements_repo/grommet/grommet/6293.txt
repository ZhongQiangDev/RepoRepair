### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `Meter` component with `type="circle"` is not rendering all the data points as expected. Instead, it only renders the last data point, which is not the intended functionality. This issue started occurring in version `v2.25.0` and was working correctly in `v2.24.0`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in how the `Circle` component processes and renders the `values` array. Specifically, the problem could be related to how the angles for each segment are calculated or how the SVG paths are generated. The `Circle` component might be incorrectly resetting or overwriting the angles for each segment, resulting in only the last segment being visible.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js`

This file contains the `Circle` component, which is directly responsible for rendering the circular meter. The issue is likely located here.

```
src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js`

This file contains the `Meter` component, which is the parent component that renders either a bar or a circular chart based on the `type` parameter. It normalizes the input values and passes them to the `Circle` component. While it is not directly responsible for rendering the segments, it could be relevant if there were changes in how it processes the `values` array.

```
src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js
function: function_3
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js`

This file contains styling-related functions and does not directly affect the rendering logic of the segments. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/utils.js`

This file contains utility functions that are used by the `Circle` component, such as `strokeProps` for determining stroke properties and `function_2` for determining colors. These functions could be relevant if there were changes in how colors or stroke properties are applied to the segments.

```
src/js/components/Meter/utils.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```

#### `src/js/utils/graphics.js`

This file contains utility functions for generating SVG path commands and converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. These functions are used by the `Circle` component to draw the segments. If there were changes in how these functions calculate angles or generate path commands, it could affect the rendering of the segments.

```
src/js/utils/graphics.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
```
