### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `PageHeader` heading with a long string overflows instead of wrapping when it runs out of space. This causes the heading to collide with other content, such as the "Get Started" button.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the lack of proper text wrapping or word-breaking styles applied to the heading within the `PageHeader` component. When a long string is passed as the heading, it should break into multiple lines if it exceeds the available horizontal space. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to overflow.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/js/components/Heading/Heading.js`
This file contains the `Heading` component, which is likely used within the `PageHeader` to render the heading. The issue might be related to how the `StyledHeading` is styled or how the `Heading` component handles long strings.

```
src/js/components/Heading/Heading.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/Heading/StyledHeading.js`
This file contains the `StyledHeading` component, which is responsible for applying styles to the heading. The issue might be related to the absence of word-breaking or text-wrapping styles.

```
src/js/components/Heading/StyledHeading.js
function: function_1
function: function_12
```

#### `src/js/components/PageHeader/index.d.ts`
This file contains type definitions for the `PageHeader` component. It does not contain any functions or classes that directly affect the styling or behavior of the heading.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/PageHeader/PageHeader.js`
This file contains the `PageHeader` component, which renders the heading using the `Heading` component. The issue might be related to how the `PageHeader` component passes props to the `Heading` component or how it handles the layout.

```
src/js/components/PageHeader/PageHeader.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```

#### `src/js/components/Text/StyledText.js`
This file contains the `StyledText` component, which is not directly related to the `PageHeader` heading. However, it contains functions that handle text styling, which might provide insights into how text wrapping or word-breaking can be implemented.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
