### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `onOrder` property is used in conjunction with the `action` property in the `List` component, the alignment of the list items becomes incorrect. Specifically, the action buttons ("Click Me") are not aligned properly with the rest of the list items when `onOrder` is enabled.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `onOrder` functionality modifies the layout or styling of the list items. When `onOrder` is enabled, it may introduce additional elements or styles (such as up/down arrows for reordering) that interfere with the alignment of the `action` elements. This could be due to CSS conflicts, incorrect positioning, or improper handling of the layout when both `onOrder` and `action` are used together.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/js/components/List/List.js ---
```
src/js/components/List/List.js
function: function_17
```
The `function_17` function is responsible for creating the list component and handling various props, including `onOrder` and `action`. It is likely that the issue lies in how these props are handled together within this function.

This file demonstrates the usage of the `action` property in a list component. While it does not directly cause the issue, it can be used to test and verify the fix.

#### --- src/js/components/List/stories/Order.js ---
```
