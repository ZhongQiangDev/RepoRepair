### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the filters overflow in the dropdown menu when there are many filters. The expected behavior is to have a `layer` prop that allows the filters to be displayed in a separate layer, providing more space and preventing overflow.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the overflow issue is likely due to the current implementation of the `DataFilters` component, which only supports a `drop` prop for dropdown menu selection. The component does not have a `layer` prop that would allow the filters to be displayed in a separate layer. This limitation results in the filters overflowing when there are too many of them.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js ---
This file contains the `DataFilters` component, which is directly related to the issue. The component needs to be updated to support a `layer` prop that will allow the filters to be displayed in a separate layer.

```
src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js
function: DataFilters
```

#### --- src/js/components/DataFilters/index.d.ts ---
This file contains the type definitions for the `DataFilters` component. It needs to be updated to include the `layer` prop.

```
src/js/components/DataFilters/index.d.ts
```

#### --- src/js/components/Drop/DropContainer.js ---
This file contains the `DropContainer` component, which is used to render a dropdown container. While it is not directly related to the `layer` prop, it may need to be updated if the `DataFilters` component uses it in a different way when the `layer` prop is enabled.

```
src/js/components/Drop/DropContainer.js
function: function_2
```

#### --- src/js/components/Layer/Layer.js ---
This file contains the `Layer` component, which is used to render content in a separate layer. It is relevant because the `DataFilters` component may use it when the `layer` prop is enabled.

```
src/js/components/Layer/Layer.js
function: function_1
```
