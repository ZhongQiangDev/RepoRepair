### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a required field is dynamically removed from the form by toggling a checkbox, the form remains invalid even though the removed field is no longer part of the form. This indicates that the form validation state is not being updated correctly when fields are dynamically added or removed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the form validation logic not properly handling the removal of fields from the form state. When a field is removed, the validation rules for that field should also be removed or updated, but this is not happening. As a result, the form validation continues to consider the removed field as part of the validation process, leading to an incorrect validation state.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/CheckBox/CheckBox.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/Form/Form.js`

```
src/js/components/Form/Form.js
function: function_10
```

The `function_10` is the main Form component that manages form state, validation, and submission. It is responsible for handling the form's validation logic and could be the source of the issue. Specifically, the function needs to ensure that when fields are dynamically removed, the validation rules for those fields are also removed or updated.

#### `src/js/components/Form/FormContext.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/Form/stories/DynamicFields.js`

```
src/js/components/Form/stories/DynamicFields.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` is the `DynamicFields` component that demonstrates the dynamic behavior of the form. This component toggles the visibility of the "Alias" field based on the checkbox state. It is relevant because it demonstrates the issue and could be used to test the fix.

#### `src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js`

```
src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js
function: function_5
function: function_7
```

The `function_5` and `function_7` are related to the rendering and management of form fields. While they may not directly cause the issue, they could be involved in ensuring that the form fields are properly updated when they are dynamically added or removed.
