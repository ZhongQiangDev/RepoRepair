### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `Box` component throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')` when both `border="between"` and `gap="10px"` are specified. This indicates that the component is attempting to access a property on an undefined value, likely during the processing of the `gap` or `border` properties.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error suggests that the `gap` value is not being handled correctly when combined with `border="between"`. The issue likely arises from a function that expects a certain format or type of value for `gap` but receives an unexpected value (`10px`), leading to an attempt to access a property on an undefined object.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Box/Box.js`
```
src/js/components/Box/Box.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function handles the rendering of the Box component and processes the `gap` and `border` props. It may contain logic that is causing the error when both props are specified.

#### `src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js`
```
src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js
function: function_40
function: function_41
```
The `function_40` and `function_41` functions handle the generation of styles based on the `gap` and `border` props. These functions may be involved in the incorrect handling of the `gap` value when `border="between"` is specified.

#### `src/js/utils/border.js`
```
src/js/utils/border.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```
The `function_1` and `function_2` functions handle the generation of border styles. They may be involved in the incorrect handling of the `border="between"` prop when combined with `gap`.

#### `src/js/utils/mixins.js`
```
src/js/utils/mixins.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function handles the parsing of metric values, which may be involved in the incorrect handling of the `gap` value.

#### `src/js/utils/styles.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains functions related to styling but does not seem directly relevant to the issue with `gap` and `border`.
