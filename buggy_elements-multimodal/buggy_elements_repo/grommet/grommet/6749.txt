### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that there is a missing component called `DataTableGroup`, which should provide a control to select the `groupBy` value for the `DataTable`. The current implementation uses a `Select` component to achieve this functionality, but it is not a dedicated `DataTableGroup` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is the absence of a dedicated `DataTableGroup` component. The current workaround uses a `Select` component to handle the `groupBy` selection, which is not ideal because:
- It lacks the specific functionality and styling tailored for grouping data in a `DataTable`.
- It may not integrate seamlessly with other `DataTable` features and states.
- It does not provide a clear and consistent user interface for grouping data.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`
This file contains the `DataTable` component, which is the main component that would benefit from a `DataTableGroup` component. The `groupBy` parameter is already present in the `DataTable` component, indicating that the functionality for grouping data exists but lacks a dedicated UI component.

```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
function: function_3
```

#### `src/js/components/DataTableColumns/DataTableColumns.js`
This file contains components related to column selection and ordering, which are not directly related to the `groupBy` functionality. However, the `DataTableColumns` component might need to be updated to integrate with the new `DataTableGroup` component if column selection affects grouping.

```
src/js/components/DataTableColumns/DataTableColumns.js
function: function_19
```

#### `src/js/components/DataView/index.d.ts`
This file contains type definitions for `DataView` components, which are not directly related to the `groupBy` functionality. There are no relevant functions or classes here.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/Select/index.d.ts`
This file contains type definitions for the `Select` component, which is currently being used as a workaround for the `groupBy` selection. The `SelectExtendedProps` interface might need to be updated if a new `DataTableGroup` component is created.

```
src/js/components/Select/index.d.ts
function: SelectExtendedProps
```

#### `src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js`
This file contains the `Select` component, which is currently being used as a workaround for the `groupBy` selection. The `Select` component might need to be updated or replaced with a new `DataTableGroup` component.

```
src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
function: function_6
```
