### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `Name` (e.g., "File log level") and the `value` (e.g., the `Select` component with options like "Debug", "Info", etc.) are not vertically aligned. The `Name` appears to be positioned higher than the `value`, which is not the desired outcome. The user expects both the `Name` and `value` to be horizontally centered and aligned on the same vertical line.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment likely stems from the styling and layout properties applied to the `NameValuePair` component. Specifically, the `valueProps` and `nameProps` might not be correctly configured to ensure vertical alignment. The `NameValuePair` component might be using default styles or layout configurations that do not account for the specific alignment requirements of the `Select` component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/NameValueList/NameValueList.js`

This file contains the `NameValueList` component, which is responsible for rendering a list of `NameValuePair` components. The `NameValueList` component uses a `Grid` layout and passes down `nameProps`, `pairProps`, and `valueProps` to the `NameValuePair` components. The alignment issue might be related to how these props are configured and passed down.

```
src/js/components/NameValueList/NameValueList.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValueList/stories/Align.js`

This file contains a demonstration of aligning `NameValueList` components. While it shows how to align names and values to the end, it does not directly address the vertical alignment issue described in the problem. This file is more about showcasing different alignment options rather than fixing the specific issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValueList/stories/Width.js`

This file demonstrates how to set different widths for the `NameValueList` components. It does not address the vertical alignment issue and is more focused on width configurations.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValuePair/index.d.ts`

This file contains TypeScript type definitions for the `NameValuePair` component. It does not contain any logic that could cause the alignment issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValuePair/NameValuePair.js`

This file contains the `NameValuePair` component, which is responsible for rendering the `Name` and `value` parts of the name-value pair. The alignment issue is likely related to how this component handles the `nameProps` and `valueProps` and applies styles to the `Name` and `value` elements.

```
src/js/components/NameValuePair/NameValuePair.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary

The files that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
src/js/components/NameValueList/NameValueList.js
function: function_1

src/js/components/NameValuePair/NameValuePair.js
function: function_1
```

These files contain the logic for configuring and rendering the `NameValueList` and `NameValuePair` components, which are directly related to the alignment issue.
