### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `DataChart` component fails to render bars when the data includes negative values. Instead of displaying the chart with negative values, the chart shows nothing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `DataChart` component handles negative values when calculating and rendering the chart. Specifically, the problem could be related to:

- **Bounds Calculation**: The bounds for the chart might not be correctly calculated to include negative values, causing the chart to not render properly.
- **Rendering Logic**: The logic for rendering bars might not handle negative values correctly, leading to no bars being displayed.
- **Normalization**: The normalization of data values might not properly handle negative values, affecting the chart's ability to render them.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/js/components/Chart/calcs.js`

This file contains functions that calculate and normalize values, which are crucial for handling negative values in the chart.

```
src/js/components/Chart/calcs.js
function: function_4
```

`function_4` (`calcBounds`) is responsible for calculating the bounds of the chart. It needs to ensure that the bounds include negative values if they are present in the data.

#### `src/js/components/Chart/Chart.js`

This file contains the main `Chart` component, which handles rendering the chart based on the provided data and options.

```
src/js/components/Chart/Chart.js
function: function_1
```

`function_1` is the main function that renders the chart. It needs to handle negative values correctly when rendering bars.

#### `src/js/components/Chart/utils.js`

This file contains utility functions that normalize and compare values, which could be relevant for handling negative values.

```
src/js/components/Chart/utils.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```

`function_1` (`normalizeValues`) ensures that the input values are normalized consistently, which is important for handling negative values. `function_3` (`adjustBounds`) adjusts the bounds based on the values, which should include negative values if present.

#### `src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js`

This file contains the `DataChart` component, which is the main component responsible for rendering the chart.

```
src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js
function: function_1
```

`function_1` is the main function that processes the data and configurations to render the chart. It needs to handle negative values correctly when rendering bars.

#### `src/js/components/DataChart/XAxis.js`

This file contains the `XAxis` component, which handles the rendering of the x-axis. It is less likely to be directly related to the issue since the problem is with rendering bars, not the x-axis.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
