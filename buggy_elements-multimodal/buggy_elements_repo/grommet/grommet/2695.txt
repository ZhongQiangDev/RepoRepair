### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the circle meter path animation is not smooth when the value changes. Instead, it exhibits a strange animation in Chrome, while there is no animation at all in the latest versions of Firefox and Safari. The animation issue is specifically related to the transition effect applied to the SVG path of the circle meter.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the strange animation behavior is likely due to the CSS transition applied to the SVG path. The transition is set to `transition: all 300ms`, which affects all properties of the path, including those that should not be animated, leading to the unexpected behavior. This issue is browser-specific, as it only occurs in Chrome, suggesting a difference in how Chrome handles the transition compared to Firefox and Safari.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js`

This file contains the `Circle` component, which is responsible for rendering the circular meter. The issue described is related to the animation of the SVG path, which is likely handled within this component.

```
src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/meter.stories.js`

This file contains storybook stories for the `Meter` component, including the `CircleMeter` story. While it demonstrates the usage of the `Circle` component, it does not directly handle the animation logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js`

This file contains styled-components for the `Meter` component. The `border-radius` and conditional styling based on the `round` prop are not directly related to the animation issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/utils.js`

This file contains utility functions for the `Meter` component, including `strokeProps` for determining stroke properties and `function_2` for color determination. These functions do not handle animation logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/utils/graphics.js`

This file contains utility functions for generating SVG path commands and converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. While these functions are used to draw the arc, they do not handle the animation logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant function that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is:

```
src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
function: function_1
```
