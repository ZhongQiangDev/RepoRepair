### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the table in the markdown is not being rendered correctly by `Marked` version 0.4.0. Specifically, the table columns are not aligned properly, and the content is not displayed as expected. The table should have five columns: 参数, 说明, 类型, 可选值, and 默认值, but the rendered output shows misalignment and incorrect formatting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how `Marked` version 0.4.0 handles table parsing and rendering. The problem could be due to:
- Incorrect parsing of the table structure.
- Misalignment of table columns during rendering.
- Incompatibility with certain markdown syntax or formatting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- marked.min.js ---
This file contains the core `marked` function, which is responsible for parsing and rendering markdown. Given the problem description, the issue likely lies within the table parsing and rendering logic.

```
marked.min.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
This file also contains the core `marked` function, which is responsible for parsing and rendering markdown. The issue could be related to the lexer, parser, or renderer components.

```
lib/marked.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Functions/Classes

Based on the analysis, the following locations need inspection or editing to fix the problem:

```
marked.min.js
function: function_1

lib/marked.js
function: function_1
```

These functions are directly related to the markdown parsing and rendering process, and any issues with table rendering would likely be found within these functions.
