### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when a bold text ends with an escaped square bracket (`\]`) and is immediately followed by a closing square bracket (`]`), the bold text is not recognized correctly. Instead of rendering as bold, the text appears as plain text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from how the `strong` (or `**`) syntax is being parsed. The parser might be getting confused by the escaped square bracket (`\]`) and the subsequent closing square bracket (`]`), leading it to incorrectly identify the end of the bold syntax.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/marked.esm.js ---
```
lib/marked.esm.js
function: emStrong
```
The `emStrong` function is responsible for identifying and processing emphasis (`*` or `_`) and strong (`**` or `__`) markup. It is likely the function where the issue lies, as it handles the parsing of bold text.

#### --- lib/marked.umd.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions and classes in this file do not directly handle the parsing of bold text.

#### --- src/Lexer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The Lexer class handles the initial tokenization of the markdown text but does not directly handle the parsing of bold text.

#### --- src/Parser.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The Parser class handles the conversion of tokens into structured output but does not directly handle the parsing of bold text.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: outputLink
```
Although `outputLink` is not directly related to bold text parsing, it is part of the inline tokenization process. However, the primary function responsible for bold text parsing is `emStrong`, which is in `lib/marked.esm.js`.
