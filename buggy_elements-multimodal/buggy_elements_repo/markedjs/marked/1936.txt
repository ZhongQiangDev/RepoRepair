### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that an empty space node appears in the last `list_item` of a markdown list when it should not. Specifically, the `raw` property of the last `list_item` contains an additional space at the end, and this space is represented as a separate `space` token in the `tokens` array.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the `list` function processes the last item in the list. When the `list` function processes each item, it may be inadvertently including trailing whitespace or adding an extra space token after the last item. This could be due to how the function handles the end of the list or how it splits the list items.

### Explanation

#### `src/Lexer.js`
- **blockTokens**: This function processes block-level elements and calls `inline` for tokens like paragraphs, lists, etc. It could be relevant if the issue is related to how block-level tokens are processed.
- **inline**: This function processes inline elements within block-level tokens. It could be relevant if the issue is related to how inline elements within list items are processed.
- **inlineTokens**: This function tokenizes inline elements and could be relevant if the issue is related to how inline tokens are generated.

#### `src/Tokenizer.js`
- **list**: This function processes markdown lists and could be the primary source of the issue if it incorrectly handles the last item in the list.
- **listitem**: This function processes individual list items and could be relevant if it incorrectly handles trailing whitespace or adds an extra space token.
