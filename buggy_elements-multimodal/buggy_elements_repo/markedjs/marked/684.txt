### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when there is a single blank line between an unordered list (`- test`) and an ordered list (`1. test`), the ordered list is incorrectly rendered as part of the unordered list. However, when there are two blank lines between the lists, the ordered list is rendered correctly as a separate list.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the markdown parser handles blank lines between different types of lists. The parser may be interpreting a single blank line as a continuation of the current list type rather than a separation between two distinct lists. This behavior could be due to the lexer or parser not correctly identifying the transition between list types when only one blank line is present.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- marked.min.js ---
```
marked.min.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function is the core of the marked.js library and is responsible for parsing markdown text into HTML. The issue described likely involves the lexer (`a.lex`) and parser (`p.parse`) components within this function. The lexer is responsible for breaking down the markdown into tokens, and the parser converts these tokens into HTML. The problem may be in how the lexer or parser handles blank lines between different list types.

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
```
lib/marked.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function in `lib/marked.js` is also the core function of the marked library and performs the same role as `function_1` in `marked.min.js`. The issue described could be related to the lexer and parser components within this function as well. The lexer breaks down the markdown into tokens, and the parser converts these tokens into the final output. The problem may be in how the lexer or parser handles blank lines between different list types.

### Summary

Both `marked.min.js` and `lib/marked.js` contain the `function_1` function, which is relevant to the issue described. The problem likely lies in the lexer or parser components within this function, specifically in how they handle blank lines between different list types. The other files provided do not contain relevant functions or classes.
