### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that lines containing only spaces are being removed from code blocks in the output, even though they should be preserved. This is problematic for certain programming languages like Whitespace and for real-time editing scenarios where empty lines with spaces are meaningful.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the `blockTokens` function in `src/Lexer.js`. The first line of this function is responsible for removing trailing spaces on each line. This removal of spaces could be causing lines with only spaces to be interpreted as empty lines and subsequently ignored during the tokenization process.

The `blockTokens` function is directly relevant because it is responsible for tokenizing the markdown source string into an array of tokens. The first line of this function is likely the cause of the issue, as it removes trailing spaces from each line, which could lead to lines with only spaces being treated as empty lines and ignored.
