### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that task lists (e.g., `- [ ] A`) are being rendered even when the `gfm: false` option is set. According to the issue, task lists should only be rendered when `gfm: true` is set, as they are an extension of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). When `gfm: false` is set, the task lists should be treated as plain text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the `gfm` option is being handled within the markdown parser. Specifically, the parser may not be correctly disabling the task list extension when `gfm: false` is set. This could be due to:

- The `gfm` option not being properly passed down to the tokenizer or renderer.
- The tokenizer or renderer not checking the `gfm` option before processing task lists.
- A default behavior that always enables task lists regardless of the `gfm` setting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/marked.js`

```
lib/marked.js
function: function_1
function: function_102
function: function_110
```

- `function_1`: This is the main `marked` function that initializes the parser and renderer. It is relevant because it sets up the parsing process and applies the `gfm` option.
- `function_102`: This is the `Parser` class that processes markdown tokens. It is relevant because it handles the rendering of lists, including task lists.
- `function_110`: This is the `Parser` constructor that initializes the parser with options. It is relevant because it sets up the parser with the `gfm` option.

#### `src/defaults.js`

```
src/defaults.js
function: getDefaults
function: changeDefaults
```

- `getDefaults`: This function sets the default options, including `gfm`. It is relevant because it defines the default behavior when `gfm` is not explicitly set.
- `changeDefaults`: This function allows changing the default options at runtime. It is relevant because it could be used to dynamically adjust the `gfm` setting.

#### `src/Lexer.js`

```
src/Lexer.js
function: list
function: constructor
function: rules
```

- `list`: This function processes markdown lists, including task lists. It is relevant because it directly handles the parsing of task lists.
- `constructor`: This function initializes the lexer with options. It is relevant because it sets up the lexer with the `gfm` option.
- `rules`: This function defines the rules for parsing different markdown elements. It is relevant because it could include rules for task lists that are not being properly disabled.

#### `src/Renderer.js`

```
src/Renderer.js
function: checkbox
function: constructor
```

- `checkbox`: This function renders checkboxes for task lists. It is relevant because it directly handles the rendering of task lists.
- `constructor`: This function initializes the renderer with options. It is relevant because it sets up the renderer with the `gfm` option.

#### `src/Tokenizer.js`

```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: list
function: constructor
function: rules
```

- `list`: This function processes markdown lists, including task lists. It is relevant because it directly handles the parsing of task lists.
- `constructor`: This function initializes the tokenizer with options. It is relevant because it sets up the tokenizer with the `gfm` option.
- `rules`: This function defines the rules for parsing different markdown elements. It is relevant because it could include rules for task lists that are not being properly disabled.

### Summary

The relevant functions and classes identified are primarily involved in parsing and rendering markdown lists, particularly task lists, and handling the `gfm` option. These functions and classes need to be examined to ensure that task lists are only processed when `gfm: true` is set.
