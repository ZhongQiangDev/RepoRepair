### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that rendering an empty checkbox list item in Markdown leads to a crash with the error message: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of undefined`. This indicates that the code is attempting to access the `type` property of an object that is `undefined`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error suggests that the code responsible for rendering the checkbox list item is not handling the case where the list item is empty. This could be due to a missing check for the existence of the `type` property or an incorrect assumption that the object containing the `type` property is always defined.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/Lexer.js ---
```
src/Lexer.js
function: list
```
The `list` function in `src/Lexer.js` is responsible for parsing markdown lists, including task lists. It may not be handling empty list items correctly, leading to the `undefined` error.

#### --- src/Parser.js ---
```
src/Parser.js
function: parse
```
The `parse` function in `src/Parser.js` processes inline tokens. If an empty checkbox list item is not handled correctly here, it could lead to the error.

#### --- src/Renderer.js ---
```
src/Renderer.js
function: checkbox
```
The `checkbox` function in `src/Renderer.js` is responsible for rendering checkboxes. If it does not handle empty checkboxes correctly, it could cause the error.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: list
```
The `list` function in `src/Tokenizer.js` is responsible for tokenizing markdown lists. It may not be handling empty list items correctly, leading to the `undefined` error.
