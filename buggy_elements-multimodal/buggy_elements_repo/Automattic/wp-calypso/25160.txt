### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user selects a featured image from their Google library and publishes the post, the featured image does not appear in the post preview. Additionally, when trying to close the recently published post, a message appears indicating unsaved changes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a failure in the process of setting the featured image from the Google library. This could be due to:

- The image selection from the Google library not being properly saved or updated in the state.
- The image not being correctly fetched or rendered in the post preview.
- The state management not properly reflecting the changes made to the featured image.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `client/blocks/image-editor/image-editor-canvas.jsx`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `client/my-sites/media-library/data-source.jsx`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx`

```
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: EditorFeaturedImage
```

- `function_1`: This function retrieves the featured image ID and other related data from the state. If the featured image ID is not correctly set or retrieved, this could contribute to the issue.
- `EditorFeaturedImage`: This class manages the featured image selection and rendering. If the image selection process or state updates are not handled correctly, this could be a source of the problem.

#### `client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/preview-container.jsx`

```
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/preview-container.jsx
function: componentDidMount
function: componentDidUpdate
function: function_4
function: function_7
function: render
```

- `componentDidMount`: This function fetches the image when the component mounts. If the image is not fetched correctly, it could lead to the issue.
- `componentDidUpdate`: This function fetches the image when the `siteId` or `itemId` changes. If the image is not fetched correctly after a change, it could contribute to the problem.
- `function_4`: This function handles the retrieval of the image. If the image is not fetched correctly, it could be a source of the issue.
- `function_7`: This function updates the component's state with the retrieved image. If the state is not updated correctly, it could lead to the issue.
- `render`: This function renders the featured image preview. If the image is not rendered correctly, it could be a source of the problem.

#### `client/state/media/actions.js`

```
client/state/media/actions.js
function: requestMediaItem
function: successMediaItemRequest
function: failMediaItemRequest
```

- `requestMediaItem`: This function signals that a media item is being requested. If the request is not initiated correctly, it could contribute to the issue.
- `successMediaItemRequest`: This function indicates that a media item request has succeeded. If the success state is not handled correctly, it could be a source of the problem.
- `failMediaItemRequest`: This function indicates that a media item request has failed. If the failure state is not handled correctly, it could lead to the issue.
