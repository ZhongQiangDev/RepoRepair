### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when opening a Jetpack post for a site that has the JSON API turned off, the replies endpoint returns a 403 error. This results in a flood of error notices being displayed, indicating that the application is not handling the error gracefully. Ideally, the application should limit retries and display a single error message in the comments section instead of flooding the user with multiple error notices.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the application not properly handling the 403 error response from the replies endpoint. Instead of gracefully handling the error and displaying a single error message, the application continues to retry the request, leading to multiple error notices being displayed. This suggests that the error handling logic is either missing or not functioning as intended.
