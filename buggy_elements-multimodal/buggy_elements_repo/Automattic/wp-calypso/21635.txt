### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the prop `showEmailSettings` should be renamed to `showNotificationSettings` to reflect the fact that the popover now deals with both new post notifications and email notification settings. Additionally, the test case specifies that recommended sites under the search box should not have a 'Settings' link, even if the user is following one of them.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is primarily due to the outdated naming of the prop `showEmailSettings`. This prop name does not accurately reflect the current functionality of the popover, which now includes both email and notification settings. Renaming the prop to `showNotificationSettings` will better represent the current functionality.

The second part of the issue involves ensuring that the 'Settings' link does not appear for recommended sites under the search box. This likely involves checking the conditions under which the 'Settings' link is rendered and ensuring that it is not displayed for recommended sites.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/blocks/reader-email-settings/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `ReaderEmailSettings` class and the `mapStateToProps` function. Since the issue involves renaming `showEmailSettings` to `showNotificationSettings`, this file is relevant because it deals with email settings. However, the class and function names do not directly reference the prop in question.

```
client/blocks/reader-email-settings/index.jsx
function: mapStateToProps
class: ReaderEmailSettings
```

#### --- client/blocks/reader-recommended-sites/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `RecommendedSites` class, which is responsible for displaying recommended sites. The issue specifies that recommended sites should not have a 'Settings' link. This file is relevant because it handles the rendering of recommended sites.

```
client/blocks/reader-recommended-sites/index.jsx
class: RecommendedSites
```

#### --- client/blocks/reader-site-notification-settings/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `ReaderSiteNotificationSettings` class and the `mapStateToProps` function. This file is relevant because it deals with notification settings, which is part of the issue.

```

#### --- client/components/reader-popover/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `ReaderPopover` function, which creates a popover element. This file is not directly related to the issue of renaming the prop or the 'Settings' link for recommended sites.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/reader/following-manage/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `FollowingManage` class and the `function_1` function. This file is relevant because it manages the list of sites the user is following and handles search functionality, which includes recommended sites.

```
client/reader/following-manage/index.jsx
class: FollowingManage
function: function_1
```
