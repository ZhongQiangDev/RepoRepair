### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the input fields across different steps in the signup process have inconsistent widths. The goal is to make all these input fields have the same max-width, specifically matching the width of the `site-topic` input field.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The inconsistency in input field widths is likely due to different CSS styles being applied to each input field in various steps of the signup process. This could be caused by:
- Different CSS classes or inline styles being applied to each input field.
- Lack of a unified CSS class or style rule that enforces a consistent max-width for all input fields.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/signup/main.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/signup/steps/about/index.jsx ---
```
client/signup/steps/about/index.jsx
class: AboutStep
```
The `AboutStep` class manages form inputs, including the site topic input field. This class likely contains the relevant code for rendering the input fields and applying styles.

#### --- client/signup/steps/site-title/index.jsx ---
```
client/signup/steps/site-title/index.jsx
class: SiteTitleStep
```
The `SiteTitleStep` class manages the step where the user enters a site title. This class likely contains the relevant code for rendering the input fields and applying styles.

#### --- client/signup/steps/site-topic/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/signup/steps/user/index.jsx ---
```
client/signup/steps/user/index.jsx
class: UserStep
```
The `UserStep` class manages the user signup step, which includes input fields for user information. This class likely contains the relevant code for rendering the input fields and applying styles.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
client/signup/steps/about/index.jsx
class: AboutStep

client/signup/steps/site-title/index.jsx
class: SiteTitleStep

client/signup/steps/user/index.jsx
class: UserStep
```

These classes are likely responsible for rendering the input fields in their respective steps and applying styles. To fix the issue, you should ensure that all input fields in these classes use the same max-width, ideally matching the width of the `site-topic` input field. This may involve updating the CSS styles or adding a common CSS class that enforces the consistent max-width.
