### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors identified in the `GitHub Problem Description` are:

- **Issue 1:** Non-administrators see upgrade nudges and sections they shouldn't, such as "Ads Earnings" and "Ads Settings."
- **Issue 2:** After deleting all items from the cart, non-administrators gain access to sections they shouldn't, and there's no notice indicating they are unauthorized.
- **Issue 3:** When attempting to purchase something as a non-administrator, the checkout process breaks with a console error indicating that only administrators can make purchases.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The causes behind these behaviors could be:

- **Issue 1:** The application does not properly check user roles before displaying certain sections or upgrade nudges.
- **Issue 2:** The application does not enforce proper authorization checks after cart items are removed, allowing non-administrators to access restricted sections.
- **Issue 3:** The checkout process does not handle non-administrator users gracefully, resulting in a broken flow and console errors.
