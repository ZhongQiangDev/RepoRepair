### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that products cannot be added to the store if the category contains an "&" symbol. When attempting to save a product with a category that includes "&", an error message "There was a problem saving" is displayed, and the product fails to save.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the "&" symbol is being handled in the category name. This symbol might be causing issues with URL encoding, API request formatting, or data serialization/deserialization processes. The error could be occurring during the API request to create or update the product, where the category name with "&" is not being properly encoded or is causing a conflict in the request parameters.
