### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the text displayed on the "checkout thank you" page for users who have upgraded to the WordPress.com Premium plan. Specifically:

- The text mentions "No ads or limits," which is misleading because there is a storage limit for the Premium plan.
- The text states that the Premium plan adds 10GB of file storage, which can be confusing for users upgrading from the Personal plan, as they already have 6GB of storage.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the function responsible for generating the description text for the "Video and audio posts" feature on the "checkout thank you" page. This function is probably not correctly accounting for the storage limits and the existing storage of users upgrading from different plans.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/blocks/plan-storage/bar.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/blocks/plan-storage/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/blocks/product-purchase-features-list/video-audio-posts.jsx ---
```
client/blocks/product-purchase-features-list/video-audio-posts.jsx
function: getDescription
```

The `getDescription` function is likely responsible for generating the description text for the "Video and audio posts" feature. It needs to be updated to remove the "no limits" reference and to clarify the total storage available for the Premium plan.

#### --- client/lib/plans/index.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/my-sites/checkout/checkout-thank-you/premium-plan-details.jsx ---
```
client/my-sites/checkout/checkout-thank-you/premium-plan-details.jsx
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` (which is actually the `PremiumPlanDetails` component) is responsible for rendering the "checkout thank you" page. It may need to be updated to ensure that the correct description text is passed to the `PurchaseDetail` components.
