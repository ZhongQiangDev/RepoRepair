### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the support contact form breaks when there is no primary site set. Specifically, when a user deletes their primary site and then tries to access the contact form, the form fails to load, resulting in console errors indicating that it cannot read the property 'ID' of null. This suggests that the application is attempting to access a site ID that does not exist.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be that the application is trying to access a site ID that is no longer available because the primary site has been deleted. This results in a null value being passed to a part of the code that expects a valid site ID, leading to the "Cannot read property 'ID' of null" error. The application does not handle the case where no primary site is set, leading to a failure in loading the contact form.
