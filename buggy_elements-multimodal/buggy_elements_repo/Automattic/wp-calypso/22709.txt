### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the application does not display a success screen after the user has inserted a contact form and connected successfully. Instead, it continues to display the contact form tile. Additionally, the actual insertion of the contact form should occur only after the user has connected, which is not currently happening.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from the following issues:
- The application does not have a mechanism to detect whether the contact form has been inserted and connected successfully.
- The logic for rendering the success screen is missing or not correctly implemented.
- The contact form insertion is not being deferred until after the user has connected.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `client/components/tinymce/plugins/contact-form/plugin.jsx`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The file is focused on adding a contact form feature to the TinyMCE editor, but it does not handle the onboarding process or the success screen.

#### `client/jetpack-onboarding/main.jsx`

```
client/jetpack-onboarding/main.jsx
function: function_1
class: JetpackOnboardingMain
```

- `function_1`: This function retrieves onboarding-related data for a specific site. It may need to be updated to include information about whether the contact form has been inserted and connected successfully.
- `JetpackOnboardingMain`: This class manages the Jetpack onboarding flow. It may need to be updated to handle the rendering of the success screen and to ensure the contact form is inserted only after the user has connected.

#### `client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/contact-form.jsx`

```
client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/contact-form.jsx
class: JetpackOnboardingContactFormStep
```

- `JetpackOnboardingContactFormStep`: This class handles the contact form step in the onboarding process. It may need to be updated to include logic for rendering the success screen and to ensure the contact form is inserted only after the user has connected.

#### `client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js`

```
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
function: function_5
```

- `function_3`: This function saves Jetpack onboarding settings. It may need to be updated to include information about whether the contact form has been inserted and connected successfully.
- `function_4`: This function handles the successful saving of Jetpack onboarding settings. It may need to be updated to trigger the rendering of the success screen.
- `function_5`: This function updates Jetpack onboarding settings. It may need to be updated to ensure the contact form is inserted only after the user has connected.

#### Summary

The relevant files and functions/classes that need inspection or editing are:

```
client/jetpack-onboarding/main.jsx
function: function_1
class: JetpackOnboardingMain

client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/contact-form.jsx
class: JetpackOnboardingContactFormStep

client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js
function: function_3
