### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that embedded Crowdsignal surveys are not being displayed in the Reader full post view. Instead of showing the survey, the post appears empty or does not display any representation of the survey.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue appears to be related to how the system detects and processes embedded content, specifically surveys from Crowdsignal. The system currently has a mechanism to detect and display Polldaddy polls, but it lacks a similar mechanism for Crowdsignal surveys. This results in the surveys not being recognized and therefore not being displayed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- client/blocks/reader-full-post/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/lib/post-normalizer/index.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-polls.js ---
```
client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-polls.js
function: detectPolls
```
This file contains the `detectPolls` function, which is responsible for detecting and transforming Polldaddy poll embeds. A similar function is needed for detecting Crowdsignal surveys.

#### --- client/reader/stream/post-unavailable.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/state/reader/posts/normalization-rules.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-polls.js
function: detectPolls
```

### Additional Considerations

To fix the issue, a new function similar to `detectPolls` should be created to detect and transform Crowdsignal surveys. This function should be added to the appropriate file and integrated into the post normalization process. Additionally, any related classes or functions that handle post content display should be reviewed to ensure they can handle the new survey embeds correctly.
