### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that selecting the "Online Store" option during the signup process results in a blank screen instead of navigating to the Domain Search page. The user expects to be taken to the next step in the signup flow, but instead, they encounter a blank screen.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

Based on the error messages provided in the screenshots, the issue appears to be related to an authorization error. Specifically, the error message indicates that an active access token is required to fetch user information from the `/me` endpoint. This suggests that the application is unable to authenticate the user properly, leading to a failure in fetching necessary data and rendering the next page.
