### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that American Express (Amex) credit card numbers are not being formatted correctly during the checkout process. Specifically, the expected format for Amex cards is `1234 123456 12345`, but the current implementation formats all card types in groups of four, resulting in an incorrect format like `1234 1234 5612 345`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the current implementation of the credit card number formatting logic, which applies a uniform formatting rule (grouping digits in sets of four) to all card types, including Amex. This uniform rule does not account for the specific formatting requirements of Amex cards, which require a different grouping pattern.
