### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description outlines a modal that should appear when the `gutenberg` feature flag is enabled. The modal should display on the `/post` and `/page` editor pages and provide two options: "Try the new editor" and "Use the classic editor." The modal should also remember if the user has dismissed it and default to visible on load. Additionally, it should redirect to `/gutenberg/{post-type}` or the wp-admin Gutenberg editor when the primary button is clicked. Clicking "Learn More" should display the modal again.

The wrong behaviors or missing features based on the description are:
- The modal does not remember if it has been dismissed by the user.
- The modal does not default to visible on load.
- The redirection to wp-admin for Jetpack/AT sites is not implemented.
- Click tracking events for both buttons in the dialog are not added.
- The sidebar image is not clickable to display the modal again.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these behaviors can be attributed to the following:
- The dismissal status of the modal is not being stored or checked.
- The modal's visibility state is not being managed correctly.
- The redirection logic for Jetpack/AT sites is missing.
- Click tracking events are not implemented for the buttons.
- The sidebar image click event is not set up to display the modal.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

```

#### --- client/state/preferences/selectors.js ---

function: function_4
function: getAllRemotePreferences
function: getPreference
function: hasReceivedRemotePreferences
```
