### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that clicking the "Edit" link in the Reader for a user's own post on a Jetpack site leads to a broken state. Instead of entering the edit mode, the top and side bars disappear, and the reader content remains displayed without fully transitioning to the editor.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a problem with the navigation or state management when transitioning from the Reader view to the Editor view. The "Edit" link is supposed to redirect the user to the post editor, but instead, it seems to partially load the editor without fully transitioning the UI. This could be due to incorrect URL handling, state management issues, or problems with the editor initialization process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-actions-ellipsis-menu/edit.jsx ---

This file contains functions related to the "Edit" button in the post actions menu. The `PostActionsEllipsisMenuEdit` function is responsible for rendering the "Edit" menu item, which includes the `editUrl` that directs the user to the editor. If the `editUrl` is incorrect or the navigation logic is flawed, it could lead to the described issue.

```
client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-actions-ellipsis-menu/edit.jsx
function: PostActionsEllipsisMenuEdit
```

#### --- client/post-editor/post-editor.jsx ---

This file contains various functions related to the post editor. The `componentWillMount`, `componentDidMount`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods manage the initialization and cleanup of the editor. If these methods are not correctly handling the editor's state, it could result in the editor not fully loading when accessed from the Reader.

```
client/post-editor/post-editor.jsx
function: componentWillMount
function: componentDidMount
function: componentWillUnmount
```

#### --- client/state/posts/utils.js ---

This file contains utility functions for handling post queries and normalization. While these functions are important for post data management, they do not directly relate to the navigation or state management of the editor. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the described issue.
