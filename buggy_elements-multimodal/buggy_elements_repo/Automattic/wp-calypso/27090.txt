### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the view counts for blog posts are not being displayed in the Blog Posts list. The "Before" image shows posts without view counts, while the "After" image shows posts with view counts. The goal is to bring back the functionality to display view counts in a way that is less resource-intensive.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely due to the removal or modification of the code responsible for fetching and displaying view counts for blog posts. This could involve changes to the data retrieval logic, the rendering logic in the UI components, or the backend API that provides the view count data. The issue might also be related to performance constraints that necessitated a change in how view counts are fetched and displayed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-action-counts/index.jsx ---

This file contains relevant functions and classes related to the issue:

```
client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-action-counts/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: PostActionCounts
```

- **function_1**: This function determines whether to show views based on certain conditions and retrieves the view count. It is relevant because it controls the visibility of the view count in the post action counts.
- **PostActionCounts**: This class is responsible for rendering the view count if the conditions are met. It includes the `renderViewCount` method, which specifically handles the rendering of the view count.

#### --- client/state/posts/actions.js ---

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/state/stats/posts/selectors.js ---

This file contains relevant functions:

```
client/state/stats/posts/selectors.js
function: getPostStat
function: getPostStats
function: isRequestingPostStats
```

- **getPostStat**: This function fetches a specific stat value for a post from the global state tree, including view counts.
- **getPostStats**: This function fetches the statistics of a specific post, which includes view counts.
- **isRequestingPostStats**: This function checks if a request for post statistics (including view counts) is currently in progress.
