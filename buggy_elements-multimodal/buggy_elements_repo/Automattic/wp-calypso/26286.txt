### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the app banner related to Stats is being shown when visiting the `/activity` path on a mobile device. This is incorrect because the banner should only be shown for the `/stats` path, not for `/activity`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the current implementation of the `AppBanner` class only checks if the current path is `/stats` to determine whether to show the banner. It does not account for other paths like `/activity`. Therefore, the banner is incorrectly displayed on the `/activity` path because the logic to exclude it is missing.
