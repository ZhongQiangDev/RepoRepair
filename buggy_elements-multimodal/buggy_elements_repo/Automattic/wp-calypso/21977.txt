### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after successfully creating a Stripe Connect account, the application does not display a green success banner similar to the one shown in the image. The banner should indicate that the Stripe account has been connected and provide relevant information.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a mechanism that triggers the display of the success banner after the Stripe Connect account creation process is completed. This could be due to missing logic in the component responsible for handling the Stripe Connect account creation or a lack of integration with the banner component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/components/banner/index.jsx ---
```
client/components/banner/index.jsx
class: Banner
```
The `Banner` class is relevant because it is responsible for rendering the banner. However, it needs to be triggered by the appropriate component or action after the Stripe Connect account creation.

#### --- client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/payments/payment-method-stripe.js ---
```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/payments/payment-method-stripe.js
class: PaymentMethodStripe
```
The `PaymentMethodStripe` class is relevant because it manages the Stripe payment method configuration and could be responsible for triggering the success banner after a successful account creation.

#### --- client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/payments/stripe/payment-method-stripe-complete-oauth-dialog.js ---
```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/payments/stripe/payment-method-stripe-complete-oauth-dialog.js
class: PaymentMethodStripeCompleteOAuthDialog
```
The `PaymentMethodStripeCompleteOAuthDialog` class is relevant because it handles the final steps of the OAuth process for connecting a Stripe account. It could be responsible for displaying the success banner after the OAuth process is complete.

#### --- client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/stripe-connect-account/actions.js ---
```
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/stripe-connect-account/actions.js
function: oauthConnectSuccess
function: createSuccess
```
The `oauthConnectSuccess` and `createSuccess` functions are relevant because they handle the successful completion of the OAuth process and account creation, respectively. These functions could be responsible for dispatching actions that trigger the display of the success banner.

#### --- client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/stripe-connect-account/reducer.js ---
```
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/settings/stripe-connect-account/reducer.js
function: connectAccountOAuthConnectComplete
function: connectAccountCreateComplete
```
The `connectAccountOAuthConnectComplete` and `connectAccountCreateComplete` functions are relevant because they update the state after the OAuth connection and account creation processes are complete. These functions could be responsible for setting a state flag that triggers the display of the success banner.
