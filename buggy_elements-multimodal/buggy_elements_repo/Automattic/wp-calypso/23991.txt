### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user sets and then removes a featured image on a new post, the system incorrectly marks the post as "dirty" (indicating unsaved changes). This results in an "Are You Sure?" (AYS) dialog appearing when the user tries to navigate away, even though there are no actual changes to save.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the system tracks changes to the post. When a featured image is set and then removed, the system may still consider the post as modified, even though the net effect is no change. This could be due to the way the featured image setting/removal is recorded in the post's state or how the "dirty" flag is managed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

```

- `dispatcherCallback`: Handles various actions related to post editing, including setting and removing the featured image.
