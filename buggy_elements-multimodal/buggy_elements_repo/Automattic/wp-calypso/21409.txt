### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the signup flow does not require email verification before proceeding, even though it is necessary for users from non-supported countries to have a verified email address for their WPCOM session to be valid. Currently, there is only a notice prompting the user to verify their email address, but it does not prevent them from proceeding.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the current signup flow does not include a mandatory email verification step. The `EmailUnverifiedNotice` component only displays a notice but does not enforce the verification requirement. Additionally, the `EmailVerificationGate` component checks if the email is verified but does not block the user from proceeding if it is not. The `needsVerificationForSite` function checks if email verification is needed but does not enforce it in the signup flow.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions or Classes

#### --- client/components/email-verification/email-unverified-notice.jsx ---
```
client/components/email-verification/email-unverified-notice.jsx
class: EmailUnverifiedNotice
```
This file contains the `EmailUnverifiedNotice` class, which handles the display of a notice for users with unverified email addresses. However, it does not enforce the verification requirement.

#### --- client/components/email-verification/email-verification-gate.jsx ---
```
client/components/email-verification/email-verification-gate.jsx
class: EmailVerificationGate
function: function_1
```
This file contains the `EmailVerificationGate` class, which displays an email verification notice based on the `needsVerification` prop. It also contains the `function_1` function, which maps the Redux store's state to the props of the `EmailVerificationGate` component. Both are relevant as they handle the verification status but do not enforce it.

#### --- client/components/email-verification/index.js ---
```
client/components/email-verification/index.js
function: emailVerification
```
This file contains the `emailVerification` function, which checks if the email verification process has been completed. It is relevant as it signals the verification but does not enforce it in the signup flow.

#### --- client/extensions/woocommerce/app/dashboard/setup-notices.js ---
```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/dashboard/setup-notices.js
function: mapStateToProps
class: SetupNotices
```
This file contains the `mapStateToProps` function and the `SetupNotices` class, which check if the current user's email address is verified and display a warning notice if not. Both are relevant as they handle the verification status but do not enforce it.

#### --- client/lib/user/utils.js ---
```
client/lib/user/utils.js
function: needsVerificationForSite
```
This file contains the `needsVerificationForSite` function, which checks if email verification is required for publishing on a given site. It is relevant as it determines the need for verification but does not enforce it in the signup flow.
