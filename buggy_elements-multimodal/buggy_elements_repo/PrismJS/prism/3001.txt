### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that certain TypeScript keywords (`infer`, `type`) are incorrectly highlighted as keywords even when they are followed by an alphabetic character, which should not be treated as a keyword in that context. For example, `inference` and `typeDefs` should not be highlighted as keywords.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the regex patterns used in the TypeScript language definition within Prism. Specifically, the regex patterns for matching keywords (`infer`, `type`) might be too broad, causing them to match parts of longer identifiers that start with these keywords. This results in incorrect highlighting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core functionality of Prism does not directly define language-specific rules, so it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

#### components/prism-js-extras.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file modifies the JavaScript language definition and adds extra patterns, but it does not directly affect the TypeScript language definition.

#### components/prism-tsx.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file combines JSX and TypeScript syntax rules for TSX, but it does not define the core TypeScript language rules that would cause the keyword highlighting issue.

#### components/prism-typescript.js
```
components/prism-typescript.js
function: function_1
```
This file is where the TypeScript language definition is extended. The `function_1` function defines the `keyword` pattern, which is likely the source of the issue. The regex pattern for keywords might need to be adjusted to ensure it only matches standalone keywords and not parts of longer identifiers.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The primary location that needs inspection or editing is:
```
components/prism-typescript.js
function: function_1
```

This function defines the TypeScript language rules, including the `keyword` pattern, which needs to be adjusted to fix the incorrect highlighting of keywords followed by alphabetic characters.
