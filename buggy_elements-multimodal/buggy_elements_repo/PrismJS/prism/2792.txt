### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the ANSI-C quoting in the Bash code snippet is not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, the `\n` escape sequences within the `$'...'` string are causing the highlighting to break, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect highlighting is likely due to the way the Prism.js library handles escape sequences within ANSI-C quoted strings. The library may not be properly recognizing or handling the `\n` escape sequences, leading to the highlighting breaking at these points.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-bash.js

This file contains the function `function_1`, which defines the syntax highlighting rules for Bash. Given the problem description, this function is highly relevant because it sets up the patterns and rules for highlighting various elements of Bash scripts, including strings and escape sequences.

```
components/prism-bash.js
function: function_1
```

#### components/prism-core.js

This file contains the function `function_1`, which is part of the core functionality of the Prism library. While this function is essential for the overall operation of the library, it is not directly responsible for defining the specific syntax highlighting rules for Bash. Therefore, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the issue with ANSI-C quoting.
