### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Prism.js syntax highlighter does not correctly identify Elixir attributes ending with a `?` as tokens. Specifically, the `attribute?:` in the code snippet is not highlighted correctly, as shown in the screenshot from the Prism.js test website.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the regular expression used to identify `attr-name` tokens in the Prism.js Elixir language definition is missing the optional question mark at the end. The current regex pattern does not account for attributes that end with a `?`, leading to incorrect tokenization and highlighting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-elixir.js

This file contains the Elixir language definition for Prism.js, including the regex patterns used for tokenization. The issue described is directly related to the regex pattern for `attr-name`, which is located in this file.

**Relevant Function/Class:**
```
components/prism-elixir.js
function: Prism.languages.elixir
```

The specific line that needs to be modified is:
`javascript
'attr-name': /\w+?(?::(?!:))/,
`
This should be changed to:
`javascript
'attr-name': /\w+?\?:(?!:)/,
`

#### function_1

This function is related to handling string interpolations in Elixir and is not directly related to the issue of tokenizing attribute names. Therefore, it is not relevant to the cause of the problem.

**Answer:**
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
