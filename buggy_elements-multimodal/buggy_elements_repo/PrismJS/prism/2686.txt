### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the syntax highlighting for the "Shell session" language is not working correctly in the recent downloads of Prism.js (versions 1.22 and 1.23). Specifically, the tokenizer does not seem to properly tokenize and highlight the shell session commands and outputs. Instead, the entire content is treated as a single token with the class `token output`, as shown in the DOM tree screenshot.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the language definition for "Shell session" in Prism.js. The tokenizer rules for this language may have been altered or broken in the recent downloads, leading to improper tokenization. Additionally, the issue could be related to how the language definition is being loaded or processed during the build or download generation process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
```
prism.js
function: function_38
```
The `function_38` function is responsible for loading and highlighting code elements on the webpage. It could be relevant if there is an issue with how the "Shell session" language is being loaded or processed during the highlighting process.

#### --- components/index.js ---
```
components/index.js
function: loadLanguages
```
The `loadLanguages` function dynamically loads language definitions into Prism.js. If there is an issue with loading the "Shell session" language definition, this function could be relevant.

#### --- components/prism-shell-session.js ---
```
components/prism-shell-session.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function defines the syntax highlighting rules for the "Shell session" language. This is the most likely location where the issue lies, as the rules for tokenizing and highlighting shell session commands and outputs are defined here.

#### --- gulpfile.js/index.js ---
```
gulpfile.js/index.js
function: build
function: minifyComponents
function: minifyPlugins
function: languagePlugins
```
The `build`, `minifyComponents`, `minifyPlugins`, and `languagePlugins` functions are part of the build process for Prism.js. If there is an issue with how the language definitions are being included or processed during the build, these functions could be relevant.

#### --- assets/download.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `toArray` function in this file is a utility function for converting values into arrays and is not directly related to the issue with the "Shell session" language highlighting.
