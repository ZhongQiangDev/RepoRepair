### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `#` symbol in the shell session code snippet is incorrectly identified as a `shell-symbol` token, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. Specifically, the `#` symbol should not be highlighted as a `shell-symbol` when it is part of a command or comment.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for the `shell-session` language in Prism.js. The `shell-symbol` pattern is probably too broad and is incorrectly matching the `#` symbol in contexts where it should not be considered a `shell-symbol`.

function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `components/prism-shell-session.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for shell sessions. The issue likely lies within the `command` pattern, where the `shell-symbol` is defined. The pattern for `shell-symbol` might be too broad and needs to be refined to avoid incorrect matches.
