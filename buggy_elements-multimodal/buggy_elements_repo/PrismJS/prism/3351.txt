### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `UUID` keyword in the Java code is not being highlighted correctly as a "class-name" token. Instead, it is being rendered as plain text, which is inconsistent with the expected highlighting behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the Java language grammar definition in Prism. Specifically, the `class-name` token pattern in the `prism-java.js` file may not be correctly matching the `UUID` keyword. This could be due to an incomplete or incorrect regular expression pattern for class names, or the pattern might not be properly applied to the `UUID` keyword.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-java.js
```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `prism-java.js` is responsible for defining the Java language grammar, including the `class-name` token. This function needs to be inspected to ensure that the `UUID` keyword is correctly matched and highlighted as a "class-name" token.

#### components/prism-javadoc.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-javadoclike.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-markup.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### plugins/autoloader/prism-autoloader.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `prism-java.js` is the primary location that needs inspection and potential editing to fix the issue with the `UUID` keyword highlighting.
