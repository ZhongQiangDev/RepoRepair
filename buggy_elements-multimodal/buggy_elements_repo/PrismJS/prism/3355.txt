### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves incorrect syntax highlighting of Razor/C# code within `.cshtml` files. Specifically:
- The `@Localize.GetLabelHtml("PLACEHOLDER")` and `@Localize.GetLabelHtml("TITLE")` expressions are not highlighted correctly.
- The `@helper` keyword and its associated code block are not highlighted properly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the way Prism.js handles Razor/C# syntax highlighting. The `@` symbol is used in Razor to denote C# code within HTML, but Prism.js may not be correctly identifying and parsing these expressions. Additionally, the `@helper` keyword is a specific Razor construct that may not be recognized by the current grammar rules.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization, highlighting, and DOM integration. While it is essential for the overall highlighting process, it does not contain specific rules for Razor/C# syntax. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-csharp.js
This file contains a function for replacing placeholders in patterns, which is not directly related to the Razor/C# syntax highlighting issue. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-cshtml.js
This file contains the `nested` function, which is used to generate patterns for matching nested brackets in Razor/C# syntax highlighting. This function is relevant to the issue because it deals with the parsing of Razor/C# constructs.
```
components/prism-cshtml.js
function: function_1
```

#### components/prism-markup-templating.js
This file contains methods for handling markup templating, including `buildPlaceholders` and `tokenizePlaceholders`. These methods are relevant because they manage placeholder tokens, which could be related to the incorrect highlighting of Razor/C# expressions.
```
components/prism-markup-templating.js
function: function_1
```

#### components/prism-markup.js
This file contains functions for extending Prism.js's syntax highlighting capabilities to handle inlined languages within markup. The `addInlined` and `function_4` functions are relevant because they define patterns for parsing and highlighting content within specified tags and attributes.
```
components/prism-markup.js
function: addInlined
function: function_4
```
