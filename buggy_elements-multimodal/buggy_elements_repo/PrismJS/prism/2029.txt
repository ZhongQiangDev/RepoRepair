### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in the D language, when a single quote (`'`) is used within a double-quoted string (`"`), Prism incorrectly highlights the string. Specifically, the single quote within the double-quoted string is not properly recognized as part of the string content, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. Additionally, the WYSIWYG strings enclosed in backticks (`) are not correctly handled by Prism.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the grammar rules defined for the D language in Prism. The regular expressions used to match strings in the D language grammar may not be correctly accounting for single quotes within double-quoted strings or the special handling of WYSIWYG strings enclosed in backticks.

#### Relevant Functions/Classes to Inspect or Edit

Based on the analysis, the relevant function or class that needs inspection or editing is likely related to the D language grammar definition within Prism. Since the specific function or class is not provided in the given information, we can infer that it would be part of the language definition for D within Prism.

```
components/prism-d.js
function: defineDLanguageGrammar
```

This function would define the grammar rules for the D language, including the patterns for matching strings. The function would need to be inspected and potentially modified to correctly handle single quotes within double-quoted strings and WYSIWYG strings enclosed in backticks.
