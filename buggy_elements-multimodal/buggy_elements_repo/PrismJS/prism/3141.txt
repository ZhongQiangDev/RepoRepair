### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that SQL tick marks (`) are not being highlighted as strings in the code. Specifically, when using backticks to surround keywords or identifiers in SQL, the syntax highlighter does not format them as strings, which is the expected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the SQL language definition in Prism.js not including a pattern that recognizes backticks (`) as string delimiters. The provided solution suggests modifying the `string` pattern in the SQL language definition to include backticks as valid string delimiters.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/prism-plsql.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Relevant Locations for Fixing the Problem

The relevant location for fixing the problem is within the SQL language definition in Prism.js. Since the provided solution suggests modifying the `string` pattern in the SQL language definition, the relevant location would be:

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

However, since `prism-core.js` does not contain the SQL language definition, the actual location would be in the file where the SQL language definition is defined. Assuming it's in a file like `prism-sql.js`, the relevant location would be:

```
prism-sql.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `prism-sql.js` would contain the SQL language definition, and the `string` pattern within it would need to be modified as suggested in the GitHub problem description.
