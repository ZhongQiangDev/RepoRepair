### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that comments in Visual Basic code are not being highlighted correctly when they span multiple lines using the line continuation character (`_`). Specifically, the highlighting breaks at the line continuation character, and the subsequent lines are not treated as part of the same comment.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how Prism.js is tokenizing and highlighting the Visual Basic code. The tokenizer may not be recognizing the line continuation character (`_`) as a valid continuation of the comment, causing it to treat the subsequent lines as separate tokens. This could be due to the grammar rules for Visual Basic comments not being correctly defined or applied.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---

**Function `addInlined`**
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This function is related to handling inlined languages within markup tags and does not directly relate to the Visual Basic comment highlighting issue.

**Function `function_1`**
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This function initializes and configures the Prism object and does not directly handle language-specific grammar rules.

**Function `function_26`**
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This function handles the 'wrap' hook for HTML entities and is not related to the Visual Basic comment highlighting issue.

**Function `function_28`**
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This function defines the grammar for CSS and does not relate to Visual Basic.

**Function `function_29`**
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This function handles loading and highlighting code from external files and does not directly relate to the Visual Basic comment highlighting issue.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---

**Function `function_1`**
```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```
This function is the core of Prism.js and includes the `tokenize` and `highlight` functions. The issue likely lies in how the `tokenize` function is processing the Visual Basic code. Specifically, the grammar rules for Visual Basic comments may not be correctly defined to handle line continuation characters.

### Conclusion

The relevant function that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is:
```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```
This function contains the core tokenization and highlighting logic, which needs to be adjusted to correctly handle Visual Basic comments with line continuation characters.
