### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description outlines the need to add support for the Mermaid language in the syntax highlighting library. The wrong behavior here is the absence of Mermaid language support in the current implementation of the syntax highlighting library. This means that Mermaid code blocks are not being properly highlighted or rendered.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the Mermaid language has not been defined within the syntax highlighting library. To properly highlight Mermaid code, the library needs a set of rules and patterns that can recognize and format Mermaid syntax. This involves defining the grammar for Mermaid, similar to how other languages like CSS or JavaScript are defined.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
This file contains functions that are relevant to adding support for a new language like Mermaid.

```
prism.js
function: addInlined
function: function_37
```

- `addInlined`: This function can be used to define how Mermaid code should be handled within specific tags, similar to how inline CSS is handled within `<style>` tags.
- `function_37`: This function defines the syntax highlighting rules for CSS. A similar function needs to be created for Mermaid to define its grammar and token patterns.

#### --- components/index.js ---
This file contains a function that is relevant for loading new language definitions.

```
components/index.js
function: loadLanguages
```

- `loadLanguages`: This function can be used to dynamically load the Mermaid language definition into the Prism.js syntax highlighter.

#### --- gulpfile.js/index.js ---
This file contains build and minification functions but does not directly relate to adding language support.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- Other Files ---
The other files mentioned do not seem to directly relate to adding language support for Mermaid.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
