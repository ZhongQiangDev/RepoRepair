### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that constants are incorrectly recognized as keywords in the JavaScript syntax highlighting. Specifically, the code snippet provided:

```javascript
const { $from, $from } = selection;
```

renders with `$from` being highlighted as a keyword, which is incorrect. `$from` should be treated as a variable or identifier, not a keyword.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the JavaScript language definition within Prism.js. The language definition rules may be incorrectly matching `$from` as a keyword or a special token instead of recognizing it as a valid identifier. This could be due to overly broad regular expressions or incorrect token categorization in the JavaScript grammar.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
This file contains several functions that are relevant to the syntax highlighting process, but none of them directly define the JavaScript language rules. Therefore, this file does not contain the specific issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization and highlighting. However, it does not define language-specific rules. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-js-extras.js ---
This file modifies the Prism.js language definition for JavaScript by inserting additional token patterns. It is highly relevant to the issue because it defines how JavaScript tokens are recognized and highlighted.

```
components/prism-js-extras.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- components/prism-jsx.js ---
This file modifies Prism's language definitions to handle JSX syntax. While it extends JavaScript rules, it is not directly relevant to the issue described, as the problem is with plain JavaScript syntax.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
components/prism-js-extras.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `components/prism-js-extras.js` is the most relevant location to inspect and potentially edit to fix the issue. This function defines additional token patterns for JavaScript, and the incorrect highlighting of `$from` as a keyword likely stems from these patterns.
