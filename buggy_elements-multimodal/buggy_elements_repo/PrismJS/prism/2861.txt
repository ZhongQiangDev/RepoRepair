### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Prism.js is incorrectly identifying the `type` attribute in the TypeScript interface as a keyword, instead of treating it as a regular property name. This results in incorrect syntax highlighting, where `type` is highlighted with a different color than other property names like `data` and `total`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how Prism.js is defining its keywords for TypeScript. In the TypeScript language definition, there is a `keyword` pattern that matches specific keywords, and it seems that `type` is included in this list. When Prism.js encounters the `type` attribute in the interface, it matches it against the `keyword` pattern and highlights it as a keyword instead of a regular property name.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js

This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization, highlighting, DOM integration, language management, and the plugin system. While this file is essential for the overall functionality of Prism.js, it does not directly define the language-specific grammar rules that are causing the issue. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-js-extras.js

This file modifies the Prism.js language definition for JavaScript by adding additional token patterns. However, it does not specifically address TypeScript, so it is unlikely to be the source of the issue. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-typescript.js

This file extends Prism's JavaScript language definition to support TypeScript by adding or modifying specific patterns. The `keyword` pattern in this file is likely the cause of the issue, as it matches TypeScript-specific keywords, including `type`. Therefore:

```
components/prism-typescript.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary

The issue is likely caused by the `keyword` pattern in the `function_1` function of the `components/prism-typescript.js` file. This pattern is incorrectly matching the `type` attribute as a keyword instead of a regular property name. To fix the issue, you would need to modify the `keyword` pattern to exclude `type` or add a new pattern specifically for property names in interfaces.
