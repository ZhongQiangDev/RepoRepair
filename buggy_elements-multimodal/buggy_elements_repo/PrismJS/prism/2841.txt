### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that string interpolation within a Ruby regex pattern using the `/.../` syntax (`/foo#{bar}/`) is not properly highlighted. However, when using the `%r{...}` syntax (`%r[foo#{bar}]`), the interpolation is correctly highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the Prism.js library handles regex patterns in Ruby. Specifically, the regex pattern matching for `/.../` syntax may not be correctly configured to recognize and highlight string interpolation (`#{...}`) within the pattern. In contrast, the `%r{...}` syntax is correctly configured to handle interpolation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-ruby.js

This file contains the function `function_1`, which is responsible for extending Prism's syntax highlighting for Ruby. Based on the description, this function defines various token classes and patterns for Ruby, including regex patterns and string interpolation.

Given the problem description, the following locations in `function_1` are relevant:

```
components/prism-ruby.js
function: function_1
```

### Relevant Locations in `function_1`

1. **Regex Pattern Definition**: The regex pattern definition for Ruby regexes using `/.../` syntax needs to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles interpolation.

```javascript
regex: [
    {
        pattern: /\/(?:[^\/\\]|\\[\s\S])*\/[gimuy]*/,
        inside: {
            'interpolation': interpolation,
            'regex-source': /[^\/\\]+|\\[\s\S]/,
            'regex-delimiter': /\//,
            'regex-flag': /[gimuy]*/
        }
    }
]
```

2. **Interpolation Handling**: The interpolation handling within the regex pattern needs to be checked to ensure it is correctly nested and applied.

```javascript
interpolation: {
    pattern: /#\{[^}]+\}/,
    inside: {
        'interpolation-content': {
            pattern: /#\{[^}]+\}/,
            inside: Prism.languages.ruby
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Pattern for `%r{...}` Syntax**: The pattern for `%r{...}` syntax is correctly configured, so it can be used as a reference for fixing the `/.../` syntax.

```javascript
{
    pattern: /%r\{(?:[^\\}]+|\\[\s\S])*\}/,
    inside: {
        'interpolation': interpolation,
        'regex-source': /[^}]+|\\[\s\S]/,
        'regex-delimiter': /\}/
    }
}
```

### Summary

The `function_1` in `components/prism-ruby.js` contains the relevant logic for defining regex patterns and handling interpolation in Ruby. The specific locations within this function that need inspection or editing are the regex pattern definition for `/.../` syntax, the interpolation handling within the regex pattern, and the pattern for `%r{...}` syntax as a reference.
