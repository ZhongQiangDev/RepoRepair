### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that numeric literals containing underscores as numeric separators are not being highlighted correctly by Prism. Instead of being recognized as valid numeric literals, they are likely being treated as invalid syntax or as a combination of numbers and invalid characters.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the grammar rules defined for the JavaScript language in Prism not accounting for the numeric separator feature. The grammar rules for numeric literals in JavaScript need to be updated to recognize underscores as valid separators within numbers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of Prism, including tokenization and highlighting. The issue is likely related to how numeric literals are tokenized. The relevant function is likely the `tokenize` function or any function that handles the JavaScript language grammar.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: tokenize
```

#### --- components/prism-js-extras.js ---
This file does not seem to contain any specific handling for numeric literals or JavaScript language grammar. It is likely not relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-jsx.js ---
This file modifies Prism's language definitions to handle JSX syntax. While it extends the JavaScript language rules, it focuses on JSX-specific patterns and does not directly handle numeric literals.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
