### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the JSON code snippet is not being tokenized correctly. Specifically, the string `"/*"` is being interpreted as the start of a comment, which is not correct for JSON. JSON does not support comments, and the `/*` should be treated as a literal string value.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the JSON grammar rules in Prism not correctly handling the `/*` string literal. The JSON grammar rules may be mistakenly interpreting `/*` as the start of a comment, which is not valid in JSON. This could be due to an incorrect or overly broad regex pattern for comments in the JSON grammar.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js

This file contains the core functionality of Prism, including tokenization and highlighting. The `tokenize` function is responsible for breaking down the input text into tokens based on the provided grammar rules. If the JSON grammar rules are incorrect, this function would be indirectly affected.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: tokenize
```

#### components/prism-http.js

This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for HTTP and maps `Content-Type` headers to existing Prism language definitions. Since the issue is related to JSON, this file is not directly relevant to the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-markup-templating.js

This file handles markup templating and is not related to JSON tokenization. Therefore, it is not relevant to the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
