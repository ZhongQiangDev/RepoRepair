### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description does not explicitly mention any wrong behavior. However, based on the provided images and the context, the issue seems to be related to the syntax highlighting and rendering of PlantUML diagrams in a code editor or IDE. Specifically:

- The PlantUML code is not being properly highlighted or rendered in the editor.
- The preview of the PlantUML diagram is not updating correctly when changes are made to the code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior could be:

- **Syntax Highlighting Issue**: The editor or IDE might not have the necessary language support or plugin installed to properly highlight PlantUML syntax.
- **Rendering Issue**: The preview pane might not be refreshing or updating correctly when changes are made to the PlantUML code.
- **Configuration Issue**: There might be a misconfiguration in the editor or IDE settings that prevents the PlantUML plugin from functioning correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of the Prism.js syntax highlighter. Since PlantUML is a specific language, the issue might be related to the language definition or grammar rules for PlantUML.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- components/prism-markup.js ---
This file contains functions related to handling inlined languages within markup. While it might not directly relate to PlantUML, it could be relevant if PlantUML is embedded within HTML or other markup languages.

```
components/prism-markup.js
function: addInlined
function: function_1
function: function_4
```

#### --- gulpfile.js/index.js ---
This file contains build and minification tasks for the Prism.js library. It is unlikely to be directly related to the syntax highlighting or rendering issues.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
