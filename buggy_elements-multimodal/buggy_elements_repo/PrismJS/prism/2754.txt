### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when using the spread operator (`{...props}`) in JSX components, the syntax highlighting breaks, causing incorrect colorization of the code. Specifically, the first `<Button>` component with the spread operator is not highlighted correctly, while the second `<Button>` component with explicit props is highlighted correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the Prism library handles the spread operator within JSX tags. The grammar rules for JSX may not be correctly recognizing or tokenizing the spread operator, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. This could be related to how the library processes nested JavaScript expressions within JSX tags.

function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `prism-jsx.js` is responsible for extending Prism's syntax highlighting to handle JSX. It includes a complex regular expression for matching JSX tags, attributes, and spread operators. The issue may be related to how the spread operator is handled within this function.
