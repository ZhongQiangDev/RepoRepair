### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when a CSS value and the `!important` statement are specified together, the `!important` keyword is not recognized as a separate token. Instead, it is treated as part of the value, as shown in the image. This results in incorrect syntax highlighting where `!important` should be highlighted as a distinct token but is instead included in the value token.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the regular expression patterns used for tokenizing CSS values and the `!important` keyword. The pattern for matching CSS values may be too greedy, capturing the `!important` as part of the value instead of recognizing it as a separate token. Additionally, the pattern for the `!important` keyword may not be correctly positioned or defined to ensure it is matched after the value.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---

```
prism.js
function: function_35
```

#### --- components/prism-css.js ---

```
components/prism-css.js
function: function_35
```

### Conclusion

The function `function_35` in `prism.js` is the most relevant to the issue. It defines the CSS language rules, including the patterns for CSS values and the `!important` keyword. The problem likely lies in the regular expression patterns used for these tokens, and modifying these patterns should fix the issue.
