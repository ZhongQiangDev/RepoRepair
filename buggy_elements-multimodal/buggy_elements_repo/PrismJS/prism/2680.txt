### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Prism.js highlight demo on the project homepage breaks when scrolling down to about 90% of the page. Specifically, a backtick (`) breaks the following code, causing the syntax highlighting to fail.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prism.js handles backticks in the code being highlighted. Backticks are often used in JavaScript for template literals, and if Prism.js is not correctly parsing or escaping these backticks, it could cause the highlighting to break. The problem might be related to how the `tokenize` function processes the code or how the `highlight` function handles the tokens.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
```
components/prism-core.js
function: tokenize
function: highlight
function: highlightElement
```

**Reasoning**: 
- The `tokenize` function is responsible for breaking down the input text into tokens based on the provided grammar rules. If it fails to handle backticks correctly, it could cause the highlighting to break.
- The `highlight` function processes the tokens and converts them into HTML with appropriate CSS classes for styling. If it doesn't handle backticks correctly, it could also cause issues.
- The `highlightElement` function is used to highlight the code inside a single element. If it doesn't handle backticks correctly, it could cause the highlighting to break.

#### --- components/prism-markup.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Reasoning**: 
- The `prism-markup.js` file is primarily concerned with handling markup languages like HTML, XML, etc., and does not directly handle JavaScript template literals or backticks.

#### --- plugins/file-highlight/prism-file-highlight.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Reasoning**: 
- The `prism-file-highlight.js` file is concerned with dynamically loading and highlighting code files referenced in `<pre>` elements with a `data-src` attribute. It does not directly handle the parsing or highlighting of backticks in the code.

### Summary

The relevant functions that need to be inspected for the issue are located in `components/prism-core.js`. Specifically, the `tokenize`, `highlight`, and `highlightElement` functions should be examined to ensure they correctly handle backticks in the code being highlighted.
