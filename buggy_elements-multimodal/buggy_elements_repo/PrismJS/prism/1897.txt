### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the Markdown parser is too greedy when matching italic punctuation. Specifically, it matches any number of leading `*`s and `_`s, which can lead to incorrect formatting. For example, in the code snippet `*__foo__*` or `_**bar**_`, the parser should only match the outermost `*` or `_` for italic formatting, but it currently matches all of them.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the regular expression used for matching italic text. The current regex pattern is too permissive and allows for multiple consecutive `*`s or `_`s to be matched as part of the italic formatting. This results in the parser incorrectly interpreting the text as italic when it should not.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### components/prism-markdown.js

This file contains the function `function_1`, which is responsible for generating regular expressions for Markdown syntax, including inline elements like bold or italic text. Given the problem description, this function is highly relevant because it generates the regex patterns that are used to match italic text.

#### Relevant Functions/Classes in `components/prism-markdown.js`

```
components/prism-markdown.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary

The function `function_1` in `components/prism-markdown.js` is directly related to the issue described in the GitHub problem. This function generates the regex patterns used for matching italic text, and the current implementation is too greedy, leading to incorrect formatting. The provided possible solution in the GitHub problem description suggests a way to modify the regex pattern to fix this issue.
