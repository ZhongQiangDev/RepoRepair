### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the SQL comment (`-- this is a comment`) is not being correctly highlighted. Instead, it appears to be treated as part of the SQL string, causing the highlighting to break and not properly distinguish the comment from the SQL code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the SQL grammar rules are defined within the Prism.js library. Specifically, the grammar rules for SQL comments (`--`) are not being correctly applied, leading to the comment being misinterpreted as part of the SQL string.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization, highlighting, and language management. The SQL grammar rules are likely defined within the `languages` object, which is part of the core functionality. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- components/prism-markup.js ---
This file is focused on extending Prism.js's syntax highlighting capabilities to handle inlined languages within markup. It does not directly relate to the SQL grammar rules or the highlighting of SQL comments. Therefore, this file is not relevant.
