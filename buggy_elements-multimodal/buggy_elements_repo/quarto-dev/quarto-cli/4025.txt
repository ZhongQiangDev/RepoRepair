### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that a single Bokeh plot is being incorrectly identified as multiple subfigures (1b and 1c), even though they should not exist. The output shows subfigure labels (b) and (c) with no corresponding content, indicating an issue with how the figure is being processed or rendered.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the figure caption and subfigure labels are being handled in the rendering process. Specifically, the problem could be related to how the figure caption is being parsed or how subfigures are being generated and labeled. The Bokeh plot is being treated as if it contains multiple subfigures, even though it is a single plot.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/command/render/codetools.ts ---
```
src/command/render/codetools.ts
function: resolveCodeTools
function: codeToolsPostprocessor
```
These functions are related to code tools and postprocessing of the document. The `resolveCodeTools` function determines whether code tools should be displayed, and `codeToolsPostprocessor` modifies the document based on the format configuration. While these functions are related to code handling, they do not directly handle figure captions or subfigures.

#### --- src/core/handlers/base.ts ---
```
src/core/handlers/base.ts
function: build
function: handleLanguageCells
```
The `build` function processes Quarto markdown cells and constructs a structured block, including input and output sections. The `handleLanguageCells` function categorizes and processes markdown cells based on their language type. These functions are involved in processing the content but do not directly handle figure captions or subfigures.

#### --- src/core/jupyter/labels.ts ---
```
src/core/jupyter/labels.ts
function: resolveCaptions
function: shouldLabelCellContainer
function: shouldLabelOutputContainer
```
The `resolveCaptions` function processes a Jupyter cell to determine and return captions associated with the cell's outputs. The `shouldLabelCellContainer` and `shouldLabelOutputContainer` functions determine whether a cell or output container should be labeled. These functions are directly related to handling captions and labels, which could be relevant to the issue.

#### --- src/core/jupyter/preserve.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with preserving HTML content and does not directly handle figure captions or subfigures.

#### --- src/execute/jupyter/jupyter.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with executing Jupyter notebooks and does not directly handle figure captions or subfigures.

### Summary of Relevant Functions/Classes

Based on the analysis, the following functions are most relevant to the issue:

```
src/core/jupyter/labels.ts
function: resolveCaptions
function: shouldLabelCellContainer
function: shouldLabelOutputContainer
```

These functions are directly involved in handling captions and labels, which are likely related to the incorrect identification of subfigures.
