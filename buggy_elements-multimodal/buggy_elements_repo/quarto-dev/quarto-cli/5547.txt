### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that a hyperlink on a standalone image in a RevealJS slide does not render correctly. Specifically, when an image is the only content on a slide and has a hyperlink, the hyperlink does not function as expected. However, if the image is accompanied by other content (like text), the hyperlink works as intended.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how RevealJS handles standalone images versus images that are part of a larger content block. When an image is the sole content on a slide, RevealJS might be stripping or ignoring the hyperlink due to specific rendering logic. This could be related to how the image is wrapped or how the hyperlink is applied in the HTML output.

### Explanation

- **`revealHtmlPostprocessor`**: This function processes the HTML document after it has been rendered by Pandoc. It handles various transformations, including anchor redirection and image stretching. It's possible that this function might be inadvertently stripping or modifying the hyperlink on standalone images.

- **`applyStretch`**: This function processes images to ensure they are properly stretched for presentation purposes. It might be affecting the way standalone images are rendered, potentially impacting the hyperlink.

- **`revealjsFormat`**: This function sets up the RevealJS format, including default configurations and post-processing steps. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how RevealJS is configured to handle standalone images.

These functions are likely involved in the rendering and post-processing of RevealJS slides and could be contributing to the issue with hyperlinks on standalone images.
