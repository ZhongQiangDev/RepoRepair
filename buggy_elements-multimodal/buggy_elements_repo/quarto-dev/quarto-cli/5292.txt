### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that code annotations do not work correctly in the latest version (1.3.336) when generating PDFs. Specifically:

- The `\circled` command is not defined, which is necessary for styling the code annotations.
- Even when the `\circled` command is defined in the preamble, it works within the code block but not for the stylized list elements below it.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `\circled` command is being handled during the PDF generation process. Possible causes include:

- The `\circled` command is not being properly included in the LaTeX preamble.
- There might be a conflict or missing package that prevents the `\circled` command from working outside of the code block.
- The code annotation processing might not be correctly translating the annotations into LaTeX commands that work in both the code block and the list elements.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/command/render/defaults.ts`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/command/render/filters.ts`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/command/render/render.ts`

#### `src/command/render/latexmk/pdf.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/format/pdf/format-pdf.ts`

```
src/format/pdf/format-pdf.ts
function: function_54
function: function_58
```

**Explanation:**

- `function_54`: This function processes code annotations and replaces colorized/plain code annotations with the `\circled` command. It is directly related to the issue since it handles the transformation of annotations into LaTeX commands.
- `function_58`: This function transforms list annotations into a LaTeX-compatible circled number format. It is also relevant because it deals with the `\circled` command for list elements.

These functions are likely where the issue lies, as they are responsible for ensuring that the `\circled` command is correctly applied in both code blocks and list elements. If these functions are not correctly handling the `\circled` command, it could explain why the annotations work in the code block but not in the list elements.
