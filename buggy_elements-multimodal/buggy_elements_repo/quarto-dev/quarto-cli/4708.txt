### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when using `hash-type: number`, the title slide's content is misaligned, with the title, subtitle, author, and date not centered as expected. In contrast, using `hash-type: title` results in the title slide being properly centered.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `hash-type` setting affects the generation of IDs for the title slide. When `hash-type: number` is used, the ID generation might be causing the title slide to lose its centering properties, possibly due to incorrect or missing CSS styles. The `hash-type: title` setting, on the other hand, seems to handle the ID generation in a way that preserves the centering.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-title.ts
function: titleSlidePartial
function: titleSlideScss
```

2. ```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
function: revealHtmlPostprocessor
```

These functions are likely involved in generating the title slide and applying styles, which could be affected by the `hash-type` setting. The `titleSlidePartial` and `titleSlideScss` functions determine the template and styles used for the title slide, while `revealHtmlPostprocessor` handles post-processing of the HTML, including potentially removing the ID from the title slide when `hash-type: number` is used.
