### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the table's layout and styling when a caption is added. Specifically:
- The table header and subheader are misaligned.
- The table's width is not properly adjusted, causing it to stretch across the entire container.
- The caption is not positioned correctly relative to the table.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a combination of CSS styling and table processing logic. When a caption is added, the CSS rules for table layout and alignment may not be applied correctly, leading to misalignment and improper width adjustment. Additionally, the table processing logic in the code may not handle the presence of a caption appropriately, causing the layout issues.
