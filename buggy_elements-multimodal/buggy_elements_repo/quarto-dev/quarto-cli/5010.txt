### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that non-standard URLs (containing commas and other punctuation) display correctly inline within a blog post but fail to display in the image grid view. This suggests an issue with how URLs are processed or rendered differently in the grid view compared to inline content.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how URLs are normalized, validated, or rendered in the grid view. The grid view might be applying stricter URL parsing rules or failing to handle certain characters properly, leading to broken image previews. This could be due to differences in URL encoding, validation, or the way the grid view constructs image URLs.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/core/http.ts ---
```
src/core/http.ts
function: httpFileRequestHandler
function: normalizeURL
function: isHttpUrl
```
These functions are involved in handling and normalizing URLs. `httpFileRequestHandler` manages file requests and could be relevant if the grid view handles files differently. `normalizeURL` and `isHttpUrl` are involved in URL validation and normalization, which could be causing issues with non-standard URLs.

#### --- src/core/url.ts ---
```
src/core/url.ts
function: ensureProtocolAndTrailingSlash
function: joinUrl
```
These functions handle URL formatting and could be relevant if the grid view constructs URLs differently from inline content. `ensureProtocolAndTrailingSlash` ensures URLs have a protocol and trailing slash, while `joinUrl` combines base URLs and paths. If these functions behave differently for the grid view, it could cause issues.

#### --- src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing-shared.ts ---
```
src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing-shared.ts
function: listingPostProcess
function: markdownHandler
```
`listingPostProcess` handles post-processing of rendered content, including cleaning up images in descriptions, which could be relevant if the grid view is not properly handling images. `markdownHandler` generates markdown content based on listing types and could be involved in how images are rendered in the grid view.

#### --- src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing.ts ---
```
src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing.ts
function: listingHtmlDependencies
function: listingSupplementalFiles
```
These functions handle dependencies and supplemental files for listings. While they may not directly cause the issue, they could be relevant if the grid view requires different dependencies or files that affect image rendering.

#### --- src/resources/projects/website/listing/quarto-listing.js ---
```
src/resources/projects/website/listing/quarto-listing.js
function: renderVisibleProgressiveImages
function: toggleNoMatchingMessage
```
`renderVisibleProgressiveImages` processes images in visible items, which could be relevant if the grid view handles image rendering differently. `toggleNoMatchingMessage` controls visibility of messages, which might not be directly related but could be part of the grid view's behavior.

#### Other Files
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The other files provided do not seem directly relevant to the issue of non-standard URLs displaying correctly inline but not in the grid view.
