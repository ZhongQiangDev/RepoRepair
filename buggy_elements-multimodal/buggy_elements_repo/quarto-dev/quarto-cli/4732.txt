### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when using the `revealjs` format with the `knitr` engine, the embedded code from an external file (`code.R`) is not displayed in the generated HTML output. Instead, the HTML contains an empty `<div>` element where the code should be. However, when not using the `revealjs` format, the embedded code is displayed correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `revealjs` format handles embedded code blocks when using the `knitr` engine. The `knitr` engine is responsible for processing R code chunks and embedding them into the document, but it seems that the `revealjs` format is interfering with this process, possibly due to specific post-processing steps or formatting rules that are not compatible with the embedded code.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/command/render/codetools.ts ---
```
src/command/render/codetools.ts
function: keepSourceBlock
function: codeToolsPostprocessor
function: resolveKeepSource
```
These functions are involved in processing and embedding source code. `keepSourceBlock` reads and processes the source code file, `codeToolsPostprocessor` handles post-processing of the HTML document, and `resolveKeepSource` determines if the source code should be retained based on the format and engine settings.

#### --- src/command/render/pandoc-dependencies-html.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with dependency injection and processing, which is not directly related to the embedding of code blocks.

#### --- src/command/render/render.ts ---
```
src/command/render/render.ts
function: renderPandoc
function: runHtmlPostprocessors
```
The `renderPandoc` function orchestrates the rendering process using Pandoc, which is involved in converting the Markdown to HTML. `runHtmlPostprocessors` applies post-processing steps to the HTML, which could potentially affect how the embedded code is displayed.

#### --- src/core/knitr.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains functions related to Knitr capabilities and messages, but does not directly handle the embedding of code blocks.

#### --- src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts ---
```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
function: revealHtmlPostprocessor
function: revealjsFormat
```
The `revealHtmlPostprocessor` function performs post-processing specific to Reveal.js, which could be affecting the display of embedded code. The `revealjsFormat` function sets up the Reveal.js format, including any specific configurations that might interfere with code embedding.
