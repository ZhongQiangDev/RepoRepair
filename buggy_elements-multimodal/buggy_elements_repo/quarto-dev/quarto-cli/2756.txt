### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two issues:

1. **Lua Filter Error**: When using theorems and proofs with code blocks but no header/label, the Lua filter (`crossref.lua`) errors out with a `bad argument #1 to 'insert' (table expected, got nil)` error. This prevents the document from being rendered correctly.
   
2. **Heading in Theorem Included as List Item**: When using lists inside a theorem div, the theorem heading is incorrectly included as part of the list, which is not the expected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Lua Filter Error
The error occurs because the Lua filter (`crossref.lua`) is not handling the case where a theorem or proof block does not have a header or label. The error message suggests that the filter is trying to insert something into a `nil` table, indicating that it is not properly handling the absence of a label or header.

#### Heading in Theorem Included as List Item
This issue likely arises from how the theorem div is being processed by Pandoc. The theorem heading is being interpreted as part of the list structure rather than as a separate heading. This could be due to a parsing issue in Pandoc or a problem with how the theorem div is being formatted.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `package/src/common/package-filters.ts`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `package/src/common/prepare-dist.ts`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/command/render/crossref.ts`
```
src/command/render/crossref.ts
function: crossrefFilterParams
function: crossrefOption
```
The `crossrefFilterParams` function processes and validates cross-reference related parameters, which could be relevant to the Lua filter error. The `crossrefOption` function retrieves specific option values, which might also be involved in the issue.

#### `src/command/render/render-files.ts`
```
src/command/render/render-files.ts
function: renderFiles
function: renderExecute
```
The `renderFiles` function handles the rendering of files using Pandoc, which is relevant to both issues. The `renderExecute` function manages the execution of computations during rendering, which could also be involved.

#### `src/command/render/crossref.ts`
```
src/command/render/crossref.ts
function: crossrefFilterActive
```
The `crossrefFilterActive` function checks if the crossref feature is active, which could be relevant to the Lua filter error.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `src/command/render/crossref.ts`
   - function: `crossrefFilterParams`
   - function: `crossrefOption`
   - function: `crossrefFilterActive`

2. `src/command/render/render-files.ts`
   - function: `renderFiles`
   - function: `renderExecute`

These functions are likely involved in the issues described in the GitHub problem description and should be inspected or edited to fix the problems.
