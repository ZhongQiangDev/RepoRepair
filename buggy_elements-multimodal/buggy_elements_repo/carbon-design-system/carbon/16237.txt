### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors identified in the GitHub problem description are:

- The `required` attribute must be specified on each individual `RadioTile` instead of on the `TileGroup`.
- The invisible underlying input is not positioned correctly, causing validation errors to appear in an unsuitable location.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

- **Cause 1: `required` Attribute on Each `RadioTile`**
  The `required` attribute is not being applied at the `TileGroup` level, which means each `RadioTile` must individually specify this attribute. This is likely due to the current implementation of `RadioTile` and `TileGroup` not supporting a group-level `required` attribute.

- **Cause 2: Incorrect Positioning of Validation Errors**
  The invisible underlying input is not positioned correctly, leading to validation errors appearing in an unsuitable location. This is likely due to the CSS styling of the `RadioTile` and `TileGroup` components not accounting for the correct positioning of the validation error message.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioTile/RadioTile.tsx`

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioTile/RadioTile.tsx
function: RadioTile
```

- **Relevance**: The `RadioTile` function is responsible for rendering the individual radio tiles. The issue with the `required` attribute and the positioning of the validation error message is directly related to this component. The `RadioTile` function needs to be modified to support a group-level `required` attribute and to adjust the positioning of the underlying input for correct validation error display.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx`

```
packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx
function: function_2
```

- **Relevance**: The `function_2` function manages the `TileGroup` component, which groups the `RadioTile` components. This function needs to be modified to support a group-level `required` attribute and to ensure that the `required` attribute is correctly propagated to the individual `RadioTile` components.

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioTile/RadioTile.tsx`

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioTile/RadioTile.tsx
function: RadioTileProps
```

- **Relevance**: The `RadioTileProps` interface defines the props accepted by the `RadioTile` component. This interface needs to be updated to support a group-level `required` attribute.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx`

```
packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx
function: TileGroupProps
```

- **Relevance**: The `TileGroupProps` interface defines the props accepted by the `TileGroup` component. This interface needs to be updated to support a group-level `required` attribute.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx`

```
packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx
function: ExcludedAttributes
```

- **Relevance**: The `ExcludedAttributes` type is not directly related to the issues described in the GitHub problem description. This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the current problem.
