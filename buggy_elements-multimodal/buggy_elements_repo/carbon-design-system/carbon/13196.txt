### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `hideLabel` prop in the `Toggle` component does not work as expected. Specifically:

- When `hideLabel={true}` is set, the label is not hidden immediately but instead appears on the side of the toggle.
- To truly hide the label, both `hideLabel={true}` and the `aria-labelledby` prop must be set, which is not clearly documented.
- There is a suggestion that `hideLabel` should work independently of `aria-labelledby` and should also support the `for` attribute on the label for A11Y compliance.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior seems to be related to how the `hideLabel` prop is implemented and documented. The implementation likely ties the `hideLabel` functionality to the presence of the `aria-labelledby` prop, which is not intuitive and not clearly explained in the documentation. Additionally, the implementation may not consider the `for` attribute on the label as an alternative for A11Y compliance.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js`

This file contains the `Toggle` function, which is directly related to the issue. The `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` props are parameters of this function, and their behavior is defined here.

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
function: Toggle
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js`

This file contains the `ToggleSkeleton` class, which is not directly related to the `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` props. It is a skeleton version of the toggle switch used for loading states.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js`

This file contains storybook examples for the `Toggle` component. The examples demonstrate how the `Toggle` component can be used, but they do not define the behavior of the `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` props.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/internal/useNoInteractiveChildren.js`

This file contains utility functions that are not directly related to the `Toggle` component or its props.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
