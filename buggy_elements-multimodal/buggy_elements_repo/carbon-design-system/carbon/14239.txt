### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two main issues:

1. **ARIA Attribute Issue**: The `aria-expanded` attribute is not allowed on the Expandable Tile when it is rendered as a button. This is causing an accessibility violation.
2. **Workaround Issue**: To force the Expandable Tile to render the interactive version, a fake interactive element (a button with `display: none`) is added. This workaround is not ideal and should be avoided.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior can be attributed to the following:

1. **ARIA Attribute Issue**: The Expandable Tile component is likely rendering a button element when it detects no interactive content. Buttons cannot have children with roles, which is why the `aria-expanded` attribute is not allowed. This is a limitation in how the component is currently designed to handle interactive content.
2. **Workaround Issue**: The workaround of adding a fake interactive element is a hacky solution to force the component to render the interactive version. This is not a clean or maintainable solution and can lead to other issues.

### Explanation

- **Tile.tsx**: The `Tile` class is likely responsible for rendering the Expandable Tile component. It needs to be inspected to understand how it handles interactive content and the rendering of the `aria-expanded` attribute.
- **useNoInteractiveChildren.js**: The `useNoInteractiveChildren` function is used to enforce that a component should not have any interactive child nodes. This function and its helper functions (`getInteractiveContent` and `isFocusable`) need to be examined to understand how they determine if a component has interactive content and how they enforce the constraint. This is relevant because the workaround involves adding a fake interactive element to force the interactive version of the Expandable Tile.
