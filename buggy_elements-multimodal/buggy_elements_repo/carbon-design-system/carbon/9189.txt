### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the overflow in a breadcrumb does not have a shark fin and an offset as expected. This is because the `displayName` is not being set correctly in the code, leading to the incorrect rendering of the `OverflowMenu` component within the `BreadcrumbItem`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the `createComponentToggle` function, which is used to conditionally render different versions of the `OverflowMenu` component based on a feature flag. The `createComponentToggle` function sets the `displayName` of the returned component, but it seems that this `displayName` is not being correctly propagated or recognized when the `OverflowMenu` is used within the `BreadcrumbItem`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/Breadcrumb.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/BreadcrumbItem.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/BreadcrumbItem.js
function: BreadcrumbItem
```

The `BreadcrumbItem` function is relevant because it is where the `OverflowMenu` is being used and where the issue with the shark fin and offset is occurring.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js`

```
packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js
function: createComponentToggle
```

The `createComponentToggle` function is relevant because it is responsible for creating the `OverflowMenu` component with the correct `displayName`, which is not being set correctly.

#### `packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
