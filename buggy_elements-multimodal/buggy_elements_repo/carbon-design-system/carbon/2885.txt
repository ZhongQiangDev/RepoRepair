### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that VoiceOver does not announce the "On" or "Off" labels when interacting with the toggle component. This issue occurs because the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute is applied to the spans containing the "On" and "Off" labels, which prevents screen readers like VoiceOver from reading these labels.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the presence of the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute on the spans that contain the "On" and "Off" labels. This attribute instructs assistive technologies to ignore the content, which is why VoiceOver does not announce the labels. Removing the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute allows the labels to be read correctly by VoiceOver.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
class: Toggle
```
The `Toggle` class is responsible for rendering the toggle component, including the labels. The issue with `aria-hidden="true"` is likely introduced in the render method of this class.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ToggleSmall/ToggleSmall.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/ToggleSmall/ToggleSmall.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` (which is the `ToggleSmall` component) is responsible for rendering the small toggle component. It includes an `ariaLabel` prop for accessibility, but the issue described is specific to the `Toggle` component, not `ToggleSmall`.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
class: Toggle
```
2. ```
packages/react/src/components/ToggleSmall/ToggleSmall.js
function: function_1
```

The primary focus should be on the `Toggle` class in `Toggle.js` as it directly relates to the described issue. The `ToggleSmall` component may not be directly involved but is included for completeness.
