### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a filterable multiselect component has some options selected, clicking on its `<input>` field results in the focus outline being applied to the wrong node. Specifically, the focus outline appears around the `<input>` field instead of the entire multiselect control.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the focus is being managed within the `FilterableMultiSelect` component. When the `<input>` field is clicked, the focus event is not being properly propagated or handled to ensure that the entire multiselect control receives the focus outline. This could be due to incorrect focus handling logic, missing or incorrect event listeners, or issues with the DOM structure that affects focus behavior.
