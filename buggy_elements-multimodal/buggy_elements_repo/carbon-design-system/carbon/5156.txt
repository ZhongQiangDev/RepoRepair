### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the `onChange` event is not being fired for the `SelectableTile` component, while `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` events are being triggered. According to the documentation and expected behavior, `onChange` should be fired when the selection state of the tile changes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `onChange` event is being handled within the `SelectableTile` component. The `onChange` event should be triggered when the selection state of the tile changes, but it appears that this event is not being properly propagated or triggered. This could be due to a few reasons:

- The `onChange` event handler might not be correctly bound to the internal state changes of the `SelectableTile`.
- There might be an issue with the event propagation or the event handler function itself.
- The `SelectableTile` component might not be updating its state correctly when the selection changes.

The `SelectableTile` class is the primary component involved in this issue. The `onChange` event should be triggered when the selection state of the tile changes. The relevant attributes and methods of the `SelectableTile` class include:

- `selected`: A boolean indicating whether the tile is selected.
- `onChange`: A callback function triggered when the tile's state changes.
- `handleClick`: A callback function triggered when the tile is clicked.
- `handleKeyDown`: A callback function triggered when a key is pressed.

The issue likely lies in how the `onChange` event is being handled within the `SelectableTile` class. The `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` methods should be updating the `selected` state and triggering the `onChange` event, but this is not happening as expected.
