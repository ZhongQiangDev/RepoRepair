### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the alignment of the labels in `tall` data table headers is misaligned when sorting is enabled. Specifically, the alignment of the labels in the table headers is inconsistent, particularly when only the first column is sortable.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment issue likely stems from the way the `TableHeader` component handles the rendering of sortable headers versus non-sortable headers. When sorting is enabled for a column, the `TableHeader` component may be adding additional elements (like sorting icons or buttons) that affect the alignment of the header text. This could be exacerbated when the `size` prop is set to `tall`, as the additional height might not be properly accounted for in the layout.

The `TableHeader` component is responsible for rendering the table headers, including handling sortable headers. The `function_2` (which is the `TableHeader` component) is where the issue likely lies. It needs to ensure that the alignment of the header text remains consistent, regardless of whether the header is sortable or not, and regardless of the `size` prop value.
