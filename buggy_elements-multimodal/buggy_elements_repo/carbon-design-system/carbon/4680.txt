### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components, which are subcomponents of the `UIShell`, are displayed as `Anonymous` in the React browser plugin. This occurs because these components are `forwardRef` components that do not have a `displayName` set.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components are created using `React.forwardRef`, but they do not explicitly set a `displayName` property. When a component is created with `React.forwardRef`, it does not automatically inherit the name of the function or class that defines it. As a result, the React DevTools and other debugging tools display these components as `Anonymous`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` is a higher-order component created using `React.forwardRef`. This function needs to have a `displayName` set to avoid being displayed as `Anonymous`.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` is a higher-order component created using `React.forwardRef`. This function also needs to have a `displayName` set to avoid being displayed as `Anonymous`.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/UIShell-story.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains storybook-related functions and does not directly relate to the `HeaderMenu` or `SideNavMenu` components.

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/getDisplayName.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains a utility function for extracting display names but does not directly relate to setting display names for `forwardRef` components.

#### --- packages/react/src/tools/wrapComponent.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains a utility function for wrapping components but does not directly relate to setting display names for `forwardRef` components.
