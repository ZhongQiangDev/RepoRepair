### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the container tabs do not truncate their text with an ellipsis when the text exceeds the available space, unlike the default tabs. The container tabs should display an ellipsis (`...`) when the text is too long, similar to the default tabs.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to missing CSS styles or properties that handle text truncation. The default tabs have styles that ensure text is truncated with an ellipsis when it overflows, but the container tabs do not have these styles applied.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js`

This file contains the `Tab` class, which is responsible for rendering individual tabs. The issue is likely related to the styling of the tab labels. The `Tab` class should have styles applied to ensure text truncation.

```

#### `packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js`
