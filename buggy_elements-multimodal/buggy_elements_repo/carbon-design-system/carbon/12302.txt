### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `pagesUnknown` prop is set to `true`, the pagination component displays the page number twice: once in the dropdown select element and again in the text following the dropdown. This redundancy is not expected and may confuse users.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the page number is being rendered in the component. When `pagesUnknown` is `true`, the component might be rendering both the dropdown select element and an additional text element that also displays the page number. This could be due to a conditional rendering logic that fails to account for the `pagesUnknown` state correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js ---
This file contains the main `Pagination` component, which is likely responsible for rendering the pagination controls. The issue described seems to be related to how the page number is displayed when `pagesUnknown` is `true`.

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
function: Pagination
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js ---
This file contains several functions that format strings related to pagination. While these functions might be used by the `Pagination` component, they do not directly control the rendering logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js ---
This file contains components related to pagination navigation, such as `PaginationItem`, `PaginationOverflow`, and `DirectionButton`. These components are likely used by the main `Pagination` component but do not directly control the rendering of the page number.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
