### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that `AccordionItem` from `carbon-components-react` and `Footer` from `@carbon/react` generate duplicate IDs such as `accordion-item-1` when used on the same page. This results in an accessibility violation because IDs should be unique within a document.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the duplicate IDs is likely due to the `useId` function in both libraries generating IDs in a similar manner but without a shared context or namespace. The `useId` function in `carbon-components-react` and `@carbon/react` might be generating IDs independently, leading to collisions when both are used on the same page.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js`

This file contains the `AccordionItem` component, which uses the `useId` function to generate IDs. This is relevant to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js
function: AccordionItem
```

#### `packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js`

This file contains functions and a class related to selection management but does not appear to be directly involved in generating IDs for `AccordionItem` or `Footer`.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/internal/useId.js`

This file contains the `useId` function, which is used to generate unique IDs. This is relevant to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/internal/useId.js
function: useId
```

#### `packages/react/src/tools/setupGetInstanceId.js`

This file contains a utility function for generating unique instance IDs but does not appear to be directly involved in the ID generation for `AccordionItem` or `Footer`.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/tools/uniqueId.js`

This file contains the `uniqueId` function, which generates unique IDs. This is relevant to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/tools/uniqueId.js
function: uniqueId
```
