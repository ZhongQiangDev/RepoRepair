### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the TimePicker component needs to support a read-only mode. The images provided show the structure and color/typography for both the enabled and read-only states of the TimePicker. The current implementation lacks the ability to set the component to a read-only state, and the necessary styles and controls for this state are missing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the TimePicker component does not currently have a `readOnly` prop or the associated styles and behavior for a read-only state. This means that the component cannot be configured to display in a read-only mode as specified in the design images. Additionally, the playground controls and default story for the read-only state are not implemented, and RTL tests for the read-only class are missing.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.js ---
This file contains the main TimePicker component. To implement the read-only functionality, the following changes are necessary:

- Add a `readOnly` prop to the component.
- Implement the necessary styles for the read-only state.
- Update the `render` method to apply the read-only styles based on the `readOnly` prop.

```
packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.js
function: TimePicker
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.stories.js ---
This file contains the default story and playground controls for the TimePicker component. To implement the read-only functionality, the following changes are necessary:

- Add a control for the `readOnly` prop in the playground.
- Update the default story to include an example of the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.stories.js
function: function_3
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TimePickerSelect/TimePickerSelect.js ---
This file contains the TimePickerSelect component, which is used within the TimePicker. To ensure that the read-only state is properly propagated, the following changes are necessary:

- Add a `readOnly` prop to the TimePickerSelect component.
- Implement the necessary styles for the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/TimePickerSelect/TimePickerSelect.js
class: TimePickerSelect
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TimePickerSelect/next/TimePickerSelect.js ---
This file contains an alternative implementation of the TimePickerSelect component. To ensure consistency, the following changes are necessary:

- Add a `readOnly` prop to the TimePickerSelect function.
- Implement the necessary styles for the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/TimePickerSelect/next/TimePickerSelect.js
function: TimePickerSelect
```

#### --- Other Files ---
The remaining files do not contain relevant functions or classes for implementing the read-only functionality.
