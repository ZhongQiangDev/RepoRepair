### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description does not explicitly mention any wrong behavior. Instead, it proposes the addition of a context menu component and discusses its justification, desired UX, and success metrics. The problem is more about implementing a new feature rather than fixing an existing issue.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

Since there is no explicit wrong behavior mentioned, the "cause" here would be the absence of a context menu component in the current system. The proposal aims to address this by introducing a new component that can enhance user interaction and provide more options directly within the context of the user's actions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/components/src/components/floating-menu/floating-menu.js`
```
packages/components/src/components/floating-menu/floating-menu.js
class: FloatingMenu
function: getFloatingPosition
```
The `FloatingMenu` class and the `getFloatingPosition` function are relevant because they deal with positioning and rendering a floating menu, which is similar to the proposed context menu.

#### `packages/components/src/components/overflow-menu/overflow-menu.js`
```
packages/components/src/components/overflow-menu/overflow-menu.js
class: OverflowMenu
function: getMenuOffset
```
The `OverflowMenu` class and the `getMenuOffset` function are relevant because they handle the positioning and behavior of an overflow menu, which can be adapted for the context menu.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
function: getMenuOffset
```
The `OverflowMenu` class and the `getMenuOffset` function are relevant because they provide a React-based implementation of an overflow menu, which can serve as a basis for the new context menu component.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
class: OverflowMenuItem
```
The `OverflowMenuItem` class is relevant because it defines the individual items within an overflow menu, which can be adapted for the context menu items.

#### `packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js`
```
packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js
class: FloatingMenu
function: getFloatingPosition
```
The `FloatingMenu` class and the `getFloatingPosition` function are relevant because they handle the positioning and rendering of a floating menu in a React context, which can be useful for the new context menu.

### Summary

The files and functions/classes listed above are relevant to the implementation of the proposed context menu component. They provide foundational code for positioning, rendering, and managing menu items, which can be adapted and extended to create the new context menu.
