### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the small ghost `Button` has a height of 36px instead of the expected 32px. This discrepancy is visually confirmed in the screenshot provided, where the button is shown to have a height of 36px.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the CSS styling applied to the small ghost `Button`. The `Button` component's `size` prop is set to 'small', but the corresponding CSS class for the small size is not correctly setting the height to 32px. This could be due to incorrect CSS rules, missing CSS rules, or a conflict with other CSS rules.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js ---

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The functions described here are related to configuring and displaying the button in a Storybook-like environment, but they do not directly control the button's size or styling.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js ---

This file contains the `Button` component, which is directly related to the issue. The `Button` component handles the `size` prop and applies the corresponding CSS classes. Therefore, the `Button` function is relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```

#### Other Files

The other functions (`function_2`, `function_3`, `function_4`, `function_5`, `function_6`) in the `Button-story.js` file are not directly related to the button's size or styling. They are used for configuring and displaying the button in a Storybook-like environment.

### Summary

The relevant location to inspect or edit to fix the problem is:

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```
