### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description mentions that inline links should have an underline by default to enhance accessibility. However, the provided image shows that the inline links do not have an underline in their default state. This indicates that the inline links are not following the specified design guidelines.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the CSS styles applied to the `Link` component. The styles for the `Link` component may not be correctly configured to include an underline in the default state. This could be due to missing CSS rules or incorrect application of the styles within the component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/components/demo/js/components/RootPage.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Link/Link-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Link/Link.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Link/Link.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `Link.js` is the `Link` component itself. This function is responsible for rendering the `<a>` element and applying the necessary styles. The issue with the missing underline in the default state is likely related to how the styles are applied within this function.
