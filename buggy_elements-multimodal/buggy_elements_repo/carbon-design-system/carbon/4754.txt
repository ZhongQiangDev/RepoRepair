### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `Accordion` component currently does not have an `align` prop to control the alignment of the chevron icon within the accordion heading. The chevron icon is currently aligned at the end of the heading by default, but the user wants the option to align it at the start of the heading.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` components do not currently support an `align` prop. This means there is no mechanism in place to control the alignment of the chevron icon. To fix this, the `align` prop needs to be added to the `Accordion` and `AccordionItem` components, and the relevant CSS styles need to be updated to support the new alignment options.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `ComponentExample.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `accordion.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `Accordion.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.js
function: Accordion
```

#### `AccordionItem.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js
function: AccordionItem
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.js
function: Accordion

packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js
function: AccordionItem
function: function_1
```

These locations need to be inspected and edited to add the `align` prop and update the relevant styles to support the new alignment options.
