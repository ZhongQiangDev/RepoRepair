### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the multi-select implementation needs to support a read-only mode. The images provided show the structure and color/typography specifications for both the enabled and read-only states of the multi-select component. The wrong behavior is that the current implementation does not include a read-only mode, and the component does not have the necessary styles or functionality to handle this state.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of a read-only prop and the corresponding styles and logic to handle this state in the existing multi-select components. The current implementation only supports enabled states, and there is no mechanism to switch the component to a read-only mode where user interaction is disabled, and the component displays the selected options in a non-editable manner.
