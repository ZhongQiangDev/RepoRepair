### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an `OverflowMenu` is used inside a `DataTable`, the keyboard navigation does not work as expected. Specifically, there are no visual indicators (such as focus outlines or highlights) to show which `OverflowMenuItem` is currently active when navigating with arrow keys. This makes it impossible for users to select an option using only the keyboard.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the `OverflowMenu` component inside the `DataTable` is not properly handling keyboard events or applying the necessary styles to indicate focus. This could be due to a few reasons:
- The `OverflowMenu` component might not be correctly forwarding keyboard events to its child `OverflowMenuItem` components.
- The `OverflowMenuItem` components might not be applying the correct focus styles when they receive keyboard focus.
- The `DataTable` component might be interfering with the keyboard event propagation or focus management.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/components/src/components/overflow-menu/overflow-menu.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the issue described. The functions and class described here are related to positioning and layout of the `OverflowMenu`, not its keyboard accessibility or focus styles.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`

This file contains the `DataTable` class, which is relevant because it is the parent component where the `OverflowMenu` is used. However, the issue seems to be more related to the `OverflowMenu` and `OverflowMenuItem` components themselves rather than the `DataTable` itself. Therefore, this file may not directly contain the cause of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarMenu.js`

This file contains a function that wraps the `OverflowMenu` component. While it is related to the `OverflowMenu`, it does not seem to directly handle keyboard events or focus styles. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

This file contains the `OverflowMenu` class, which is directly relevant to the issue. The `OverflowMenu` component needs to handle keyboard events and ensure that focus is properly managed and visually indicated.

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js`

This file contains the `OverflowMenuItem` class, which is also directly relevant to the issue. The `OverflowMenuItem` component needs to apply the correct focus styles when it receives keyboard focus.

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
class: OverflowMenuItem
```
