### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a Transactional/Passive modal is open, the background element (or the body) still scrolls. This is not the expected behavior as it can lead to a confusing user experience where the modal is open but the background content can still be scrolled.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the absence of a mechanism that disables scrolling on the body or parent element when the modal is open. In frameworks like Bootstrap, this is typically achieved by adding a class (e.g., `modal-open`) to the body element, which applies a CSS rule to prevent scrolling. In the Carbon Design System, a similar mechanism might be missing or not properly implemented.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions or Classes

#### --- packages/components/src/components/modal/modal.js ---
```
packages/components/src/components/modal/modal.js
class: Modal
```
The `Modal` class in this file is responsible for the core functionality of the modal dialog. It manages the modal's state, event handling, and focus management. To address the scrolling issue, the class might need to include logic to disable scrolling on the body when the modal is open and re-enable it when the modal is closed.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
class: ComposedModal
```
The `ComposedModal` class manages the modal dialog behavior in React, including opening, closing, focus management, and keyboard interactions. This class might need to include logic to disable scrolling on the body when the modal is open and re-enable it when the modal is closed.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
class: Modal
```
The `Modal` class in this file is another React component that renders a customizable modal dialog. Similar to the `ComposedModal` class, it might need to include logic to disable scrolling on the body when the modal is open and re-enable it when the modal is closed.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ModalWrapper/ModalWrapper.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/ModalWrapper/ModalWrapper.js
class: ModalWrapper
```
The `ModalWrapper` class encapsulates a modal dialog and a trigger button. It manages the modal's open/close state and might need to include logic to disable scrolling on the body when the modal is open and re-enable it when the modal is closed.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal-story.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file (`function_1` and `function_2`) are related to storybook configurations and do not directly manage the modal's behavior or scrolling. Therefore, they are not relevant to the issue at hand.
