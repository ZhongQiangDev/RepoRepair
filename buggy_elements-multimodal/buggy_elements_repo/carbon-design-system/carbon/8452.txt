### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the current data table does not have a 40px (`md`) row height option. The goal is to add this option to the data table to align with other components that offer size variants.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the current implementation of the data table does not include a `size` option for a 40px (`md`) row height. This means that the `size` prop in the `DataTable` component and related functions does not support this specific size variant.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable-story.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```

The `DataTable` class is relevant because it defines the `size` prop, which needs to be updated to include the `md` size variant.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
function: function_1
```

The `Table` function is relevant because it applies the `size` prop to style the table rows. It needs to be updated to handle the new `md` size variant.
