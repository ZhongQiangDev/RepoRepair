### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `danger` property is set to `true` on the `ComposedModal` component, the left button's `kind` property is set to `tertiary` (gray), whereas it should be `secondary` (black) to match the behavior of the `Modal` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises from the conditional statement in the `ComposedModal` component's source code:
```javascript
kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}
```
This statement sets the `kind` property of the left button to `tertiary` when `danger` is `true`, which results in the button being gray instead of black. The expected behavior is for the left button to be black (`secondary`) even when `danger` is `true`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal-story.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
class: ComposedModal
class: ModalFooter
```
The `ComposedModal` class is also relevant because it manages the modal dialog behavior, including the conditional logic for setting the `kind` property of the buttons. The `ModalFooter` class is relevant because it provides a customizable footer section for a modal dialog, typically containing action buttons like primary and secondary actions, along with optional custom content.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
class: Modal
```
The `Modal` class is relevant because it is the component that the `ComposedModal` is supposed to mimic in terms of button styling when the `danger` property is set.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ModalFooter/ModalFooter.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/ModalFooter/ModalFooter.js
class: ModalFooter
```
The `ModalFooter` class is relevant because it is responsible for rendering the footer section of the modal, including the buttons. The conditional logic for setting the `kind` property of the buttons is likely implemented here.
