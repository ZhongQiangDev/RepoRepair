### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem involves two main issues with the React `<ComboBox>` component:

1. **Multiselect Styles Issue**: The `<ComboBox>` is including styles that are meant for a multiselect component, which makes it appear broken. This suggests that the styles for a single-select `<ComboBox>` are being overridden or mixed with those of a multiselect component.

2. **Invalid State Selection Icon Positioning**: The invalid state selection icon is positioned incorrectly, indicating a problem with the styling or layout of the invalid state icon within the `<ComboBox>`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues likely lies in the styling and rendering logic of the `<ComboBox>` component. Specifically:

- **Multiselect Styles Issue**: This could be due to incorrect class names being applied to the `<ComboBox>` or its child components, leading to the application of multiselect styles instead of single-select styles.
- **Invalid State Selection Icon Positioning**: This could be due to incorrect CSS rules for positioning the invalid state icon, or incorrect rendering logic within the `<ComboBox>` component that places the icon incorrectly.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes
