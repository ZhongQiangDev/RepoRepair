### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `OverflowMenu` component is emitting a warning about the `light` prop being deprecated, even though the `light` prop is not being used in the provided code. This warning is misleading and unnecessary, causing confusion and potentially failing tests that check for console warnings.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The warning is likely being triggered by a deprecation mechanism that checks for the presence of the `light` prop on the `OverflowMenu` component. Even if the `light` prop is not explicitly set in the code, the deprecation mechanism might be incorrectly detecting its presence or issuing the warning regardless of whether the prop is actually used.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js ---
This file contains the `OverflowMenu` component, which is the source of the warning. The `OverflowMenu` class and its associated functions should be examined for any references to the `light` prop and the deprecation mechanism.

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/deprecateFieldOnObject.js ---
This file contains the `deprecateFieldOnObject` function, which is likely used to deprecate fields on objects. This function might be responsible for issuing the warning about the `light` prop.

```
packages/react/src/internal/deprecateFieldOnObject.js
function: deprecateFieldOnObject
```

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/warning.js ---
This file contains the `warning` function, which is used to log warnings to the console. This function is likely called by the deprecation mechanism to issue the warning about the `light` prop.

```
packages/react/src/internal/warning.js
function: warning
```

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/deprecate.js ---
This file contains the `deprecate` function, which wraps a prop type validator and issues a warning when a deprecated prop is used. This function might be responsible for detecting the `light` prop and issuing the warning.

```
packages/react/src/prop-types/deprecate.js
function: deprecate
```

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js ---
This file contains the `createChainableTypeChecker` function, which is used to create custom prop validators. While this function is related to prop validation, it is not directly responsible for the deprecation warning about the `light` prop.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
