### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `RadioButton` component needs to support a `readOnly` prop. This prop should allow the radio button to be displayed in a read-only state, meaning it cannot be interacted with or changed by the user. The component should also have appropriate styles for this read-only state, and the playground should include controls to demonstrate this state. Additionally, RTL tests should be added to ensure the read-only class is applied correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the `RadioButton` component does not include a `readOnly` prop or the associated styles for a read-only state. This means that the component cannot be used in a read-only context as required. The playground and stories also do not include controls or examples for the read-only state, and there are no RTL tests for this functionality.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js`

This file contains the `RadioButton` component, which needs to be updated to include the `readOnly` prop and the associated styles. The `handleOnChange` function should also be modified to prevent changes when the component is in read-only mode.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
function: RadioButton
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js`

This file contains the stories for the `RadioButton` component. It needs to be updated to include a story for the read-only state and controls in the playground to demonstrate this state.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js`

This file contains the `RadioButtonGroup` component. While it does not directly need changes for the `readOnly` prop, it should be checked to ensure it works correctly with read-only radio buttons.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
function: RadioButtonGroup
```
