### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the button in its danger state does not communicate the danger state to screen reader users. This means that while the button visually indicates a danger state (e.g., with red color or specific styling), this information is not conveyed to users relying on screen readers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the lack of appropriate ARIA attributes or other accessibility features that would inform screen readers about the danger state of the button. Specifically, the button should include an `aria-describedby` attribute that references a visually hidden span containing a description of the danger state, as suggested in the GitHub problem description.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```

The `Button` function is relevant because it is the main component responsible for rendering buttons. It needs to be modified to include the `aria-describedby` attribute when the button is in a danger state.

#### `packages/react/src/components/DangerButton/DangerButton.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/DangerButton/DangerButton.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function is relevant because it renders a `Button` component with the `kind` prop set to "danger". This function should ensure that the `aria-describedby` attribute is included when rendering the button.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: function_2
```

The `function_2` function is relevant because it checks for accessibility issues related to icons. While it does not directly address the danger state issue, it is part of the overall accessibility checks and may need to be updated to include checks for the danger state.
