### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `IconButton` component has incorrect right padding. Specifically, it appears to be using the padding calculations for a medium (`md`) button, which is not appropriate for the `IconButton`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect right padding likely stems from the `IconButton` component inheriting or applying styles intended for a different button size (`md`). This could be due to:
- Incorrect CSS class application.
- Incorrect prop handling in the `IconButton` component.
- Incorrect default values or fallbacks for the `size` prop.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily for storybook configurations and does not directly affect the `IconButton` padding.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```
The `Button` function is relevant because the `IconButton` component likely extends or uses this `Button` component. The padding issue might be related to how the `Button` component handles its `size` prop and applies corresponding styles.

#### `packages/react/src/components/IconButton/index.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/IconButton/index.js
function: IconButton
```
The `IconButton` function is directly relevant as it is the component in question. The issue might be in how it handles the `size` prop or applies styles to the underlying `Button` component.

#### `packages/react/src/components/IconButton/next/IconButton.stories.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is for storybook configurations and does not directly affect the `IconButton` padding.
