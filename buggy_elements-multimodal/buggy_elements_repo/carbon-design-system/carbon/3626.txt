### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the rail (side navigation) is collapsed, the submenu remains expanded, causing additional whitespace and an off-looking active state if a submenu item is focused or selected. This results in a poor user experience as the submenu items are not visible in the collapsed state.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the state of the submenu is not being properly synchronized with the state of the rail (side navigation). When the rail is collapsed, the submenu should also collapse to avoid the extra whitespace and ensure that the active state is correctly displayed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
function: SideNav
```

The `SideNav` component manages the expanded state of the side navigation. It needs to ensure that when the side navigation is collapsed, the submenu is also collapsed. This can be achieved by passing the `expanded` state down to the submenu components and controlling their visibility based on this state.

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
class: SideNavMenu
```

The `SideNavMenu` component manages the expanded state of individual menus within the side navigation. It needs to be updated to collapse when the parent side navigation is collapsed. This can be done by receiving the `expanded` state from the parent `SideNav` component and using it to control the visibility of the menu items.
