### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `NumberInput` component needs to support a read-only state. The current implementation lacks the necessary functionality and styling for a read-only input. The acceptance criteria specify that a `readOnly` prop should be added, along with appropriate styles and controls for this state.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `NumberInput` component does not currently handle the read-only state. This means that there is no logic to prevent user input or to apply the correct styles when the `readOnly` prop is set to `true`. Additionally, there are no controls or stories in the playground to demonstrate this state, and no RTL tests to ensure the read-only class is applied correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js ---
This file contains the main `NumberInput` component, which needs to be updated to support the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
function: NumberInput
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains the skeleton loading state for the `NumberInput` component. It does not directly relate to the read-only state but should be consistent with the main component.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.stories.js ---
This file contains the stories for the `NumberInput` component. It needs to be updated to include a story for the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.stories.js
function: function_2
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js ---
This file contains the `TextInput` component, which is not directly related to the `NumberInput` component's read-only state.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
