### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Content Switcher component fails to meet the WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast requirement. Specifically, the light grey outline of the unselected tab does not achieve the required 3:1 contrast against the background, leading to confusion about the component's identity and functionality. This issue is particularly pronounced in a 2-tab implementation where the unselected tab can be mistaken for a separate button.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the insufficient contrast between the visual elements of the Content Switcher component. The light grey outline of the unselected tab does not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio required by WCAG 1.4.11. This lack of contrast makes it difficult for users to distinguish between the selected and unselected tabs, especially in low-resolution scenarios or when viewed on devices with different display settings. The problem is exacerbated by the absence of any visual 'binding' between the selected and unselected tabs, which can lead to the component being misidentified as separate buttons.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/components/src/components/content-switcher/content-switcher.js`

This file contains the `ContentSwitcher` class, which manages the behavior of the Content Switcher component. However, the issue described is related to the visual styling and contrast of the component, not its functional behavior. Therefore, this file does not contain any relevant functions or classes for fixing the contrast issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js`

This file contains functions related to the storybook configuration for the Content Switcher component. These functions are used to demonstrate and test the component in a development environment. They do not directly affect the visual styling or contrast of the component.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js`

This file contains the `ContentSwitcher` class, which is a React component that manages the state and rendering of the Content Switcher. The class includes props for managing the selected index, selection mode, and event handlers. While this class manages the component's behavior, it does not directly handle the visual styling or contrast.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/themes/src/tools.js`

This file contains the `adjustLightness` function, which adjusts the lightness of a color token. This function could be relevant for adjusting the contrast of the Content Switcher component. By using this function, the lightness of the unselected tab's outline could be adjusted to meet the required 3:1 contrast ratio.

```
packages/themes/src/tools.js
function: adjustLightness
```

### Summary

The primary issue is the insufficient contrast between the visual elements of the Content Switcher component. The `adjustLightness` function in `packages/themes/src/tools.js` is relevant for adjusting the contrast of the component. Other files do not contain relevant functions or classes for fixing the contrast issue.
