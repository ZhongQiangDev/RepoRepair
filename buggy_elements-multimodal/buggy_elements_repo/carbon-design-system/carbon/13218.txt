### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `caption` prop is declared in the `ActionableNotification` component's `propTypes`, but it is not actually implemented or used within the component. As a result, when a user provides a value for the `caption` prop, nothing is rendered, preventing the user from adding a caption like a timestamp to the notification.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that while the `caption` prop is defined in the `propTypes` for `ActionableNotification`, the component's implementation does not include logic to handle or render this prop. This means that even though the documentation and `propTypes` suggest that `caption` can be used, the actual component code does not process or display the value passed to this prop.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js
function: ActionableNotification
```
The `ActionableNotification` function is relevant because it is the component where the `caption` prop is declared in `propTypes` but not implemented. This function needs to be inspected and edited to include the logic for rendering the `caption` prop.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/stories/ActionableNotification.stories.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/stories/ActionableNotification.stories.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` (Playground) is relevant because it demonstrates the usage of the `ActionableNotification` component with various props, including `caption`. This function should be inspected to ensure that it correctly passes the `caption` prop and that the expected behavior is demonstrated.

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/deprecate.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is not relevant to the issue because it deals with deprecating props, which is not related to the implementation of the `caption` prop.

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is not relevant to the issue because it deals with creating chainable type checkers, which is not related to the implementation of the `caption` prop.
