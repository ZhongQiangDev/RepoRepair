### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that clicking the "Show Code" button under the "Docs" section of the Notifications component results in the display of irrelevant code, specifically `<FeatureFlags>` tags, instead of the actual code for the Notifications component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the code snippets are being generated or rendered in the Storybook documentation. The presence of `<FeatureFlags>` tags suggests that the code snippet is being generated from a higher-level component or wrapper that includes these tags, rather than the actual Notification component code. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the Storybook setup or an issue with how the component's code is being extracted and displayed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/.storybook/main.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to the Storybook configuration and webpack setup, but it does not directly handle the code snippets displayed in the "Docs" section.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/FeatureFlags/index.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
While this file defines the `FeatureFlags` component, it is not directly responsible for generating or displaying the code snippets in the "Docs" section.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` is responsible for adding an inline notification variant to the Storybook. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how the inline notification is being rendered or if there is a misconfiguration in the story definition.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains the actual Notification component implementation but does not handle the code snippets displayed in the "Docs" section.

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to toggling between different versions of a component based on feature flags, but it does not directly handle the code snippets displayed in the "Docs" section.

### Conclusion

The most relevant file to inspect is `packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js`, specifically the `function_3` function. This function might need to be checked for any misconfigurations or issues that could be causing the wrong code snippet to be displayed. Additionally, the Storybook configuration and any related code extraction logic should be reviewed to ensure that the correct code snippets are being generated and displayed.
