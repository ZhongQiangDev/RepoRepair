### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the calendar icon in the date picker is clicked, it is impossible to select a date using the arrow keys on the keyboard. However, when the calendar is opened by clicking on the input field, keyboard navigation works fine.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the date picker handles keyboard events when the calendar is opened via the icon versus when it is opened via the input field. The event listeners or focus management might be set up differently in these two scenarios, leading to the keyboard navigation not functioning correctly when the calendar is opened via the icon.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### packages/components/src/components/date-picker/date-picker.js

This file contains the `DatePicker` class, which is responsible for initializing and managing the date picker. It includes event listeners for keyboard navigation and other functionalities. Given the problem description, this file is highly relevant.

```
packages/components/src/components/date-picker/date-picker.js
class: DatePicker
```

#### packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js

This file contains the React `DatePicker` component, which wraps the flatpickr library. It handles various props and lifecycle methods to manage the date picker. Since the issue is related to keyboard navigation, this file is also relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
class: DatePicker
```

#### packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/fixEventsPlugin.js

This file contains a Flatpickr plugin that addresses specific issues with event handling, including arrow key handling. This plugin might be relevant if it is not properly applied or configured when the calendar is opened via the icon.

```
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/fixEventsPlugin.js
function: function_1
```

#### packages/react/src/internal/focus/index.js

This file contains the `focus` function, which handles focusing on elements. While it is related to focus management, it is not directly related to the keyboard navigation issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/react/src/internal/keyboard/navigation.js

This file contains the `getNextIndex` function, which handles circular navigation through an array based on arrow key inputs. This function is relevant to keyboard navigation but does not directly address the issue of the calendar being opened via the icon.

```
packages/react/src/internal/keyboard/navigation.js
function: function_1
```
