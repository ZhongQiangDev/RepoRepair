### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `aria-label` prop provided to the `Toggle` component is not being read by the screen reader (VoiceOver). Instead, the screen reader only reads the `labelA` and `labelB` props, which are visually hidden and thus not accessible to screen readers. This results in the toggle being inaccessible for users relying on screen readers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the `aria-label` prop not being correctly applied to the underlying `<input>` element within the `Toggle` component. The `aria-label` is intended to provide an accessible label for screen readers, but if it is not properly attached to the interactive element (the `<input>`), it will not be recognized by assistive technologies.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily used for creating stories for the `Toggle` component in a documentation environment like Storybook and does not directly affect the accessibility behavior of the component.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js ---
This file contains the `Toggle` class, which is directly relevant to the issue. The `aria-label` prop needs to be correctly applied within this class.
