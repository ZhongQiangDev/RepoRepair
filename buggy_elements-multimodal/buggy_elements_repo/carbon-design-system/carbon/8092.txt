### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `Select` component needs to have a "warning state" added. The provided image shows the expected design for the warning state, which includes a warning icon and a warning message displayed below the select component. Currently, the `Select` component does not have this warning state implemented.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the `Select` component does not currently support a warning state. This means that the component lacks the necessary logic and styling to display a warning icon and a warning message when the component is in a warning state. The warning state is similar to the invalid state, but it uses different icons and messages.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/FormLabel/FormLabel.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `FormLabel` component is not directly related to the `Select` component's warning state.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Select/Select-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The story configurations in this file are for demonstration purposes and do not directly implement the warning state logic.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js
function: Select
```
The `Select` function is the main component that needs to be modified to support the warning state. This includes adding a new prop for the warning state, updating the logic to handle the warning state, and applying the appropriate styles and icons.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `SelectSkeleton` component is for displaying a loading state and is not related to the warning state.
