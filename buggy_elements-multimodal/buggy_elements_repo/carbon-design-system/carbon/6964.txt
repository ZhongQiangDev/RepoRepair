### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `Tabs` component is still generating code that wraps the tablist in `role="navigation"`, even though this issue has been supposedly fixed in previous PRs. This causes accessibility issues, as it adds unnecessary navigation landmarks, which can confuse screen readers and lead to verbosity.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be that the previous fixes did not completely remove all instances where `role="navigation"` or `<nav>` is used in the `Tabs` component. Specifically, the `role` prop is still being used in the `Tabs` component, and there are still references to `role="navigation"` in the documentation and example code.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.config.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```

The `Tabs` class is relevant because it still has a `role` prop that defaults to `"navigation"`, which is the root cause of the issue.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```

### Additional Notes

- The `role` prop in the `Tabs` class should be removed or modified to not default to `"navigation"`.
- The Storybook example code for `Tabs` also uses `role="navigation"`, which should be removed.
- Any documentation or comments that reference `<nav>` or `role="navigation"` should be updated to reflect the correct usage.
