### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `light` prop is not being passed down to the underlying `<Listbox>` component when it is used in React listbox components like `ComboBox`, `Dropdown`, or `MultiSelect`. As a result, the `bx--list-box--light` class is not applied when the `light` knob is set to `true`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the `light` prop is not being properly propagated from the parent components (`ComboBox`, `Dropdown`, `MultiSelect`) to the underlying `ListBox` component. This could be due to the `light` prop not being included in the props passed to the `ListBox` component or the `ListBox` component not handling the `light` prop correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`

This file contains the `ComboBox` class, which is a React component that uses the `ListBox` component. The `ComboBox` class has a `light` prop, but it is not clear from the description whether this prop is being passed down to the `ListBox` component. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
class: ComboBox
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`

This file contains the `Dropdown` class, which is another React component that uses the `ListBox` component. The `Dropdown` class also has a `light` prop, but it is not clear whether this prop is being passed down to the `ListBox` component. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
class: Dropdown
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js`

This file contains the `ListBox` component, which is the underlying component that should receive the `light` prop. The `ListBox` component has a `light` prop, but it is not clear whether it is being applied correctly to the rendered HTML. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
function: function_3
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js`

This file contains the `MultiSelect` class, which is another React component that uses the `ListBox` component. The `MultiSelect` class has a `light` prop, but it is not clear whether this prop is being passed down to the `ListBox` component. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
class: MultiSelect
```

#### `packages/react/src/tools/wrapComponent.js`

This file contains a utility function `wrapComponent` that wraps a component with a specified class name and type. It does not seem directly related to the issue of passing the `light` prop to the `ListBox` component.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
