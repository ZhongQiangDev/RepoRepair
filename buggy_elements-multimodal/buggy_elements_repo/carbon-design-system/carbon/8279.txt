### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user performs a multi-selection using the Shift key, the selected state of the last tile can become out of sync. Specifically, if a tile was previously selected and the user holds the Shift key to select another tile, the previously selected tile gets deselected even though the `selected` prop indicates it should remain selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the `SelectableTile` component handles the selected state when the Shift key is used for multi-selection. The selected state does not respect the `selected` prop value passed in, leading to unexpected deselection of tiles.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js
class: SelectableTile
```
The `SelectableTile` class is directly related to the issue. It manages the selected state of the tile and should ensure that the selected state respects the `selected` prop value.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TileGroup` class is not directly involved in the multi-selection behavior of individual tiles.

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Selection` class and related functions are not directly involved in the tile selection behavior.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectRow.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TableSelectRow` function is not related to the tile selection issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js
class: ClickableTile
class: ExpandableTile
```
The `ClickableTile` and `ExpandableTile` classes are not directly related to the multi-selection issue but may be indirectly relevant if they interact with the `SelectableTile` class.
