### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in the vertical progress indicator's skeleton state, the skeleton text is slightly misaligned vertically relative to the dotted circles. The text should be middle-aligned with the circles, but it appears to be slightly too low.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment likely stems from CSS styling issues within the skeleton component. Specifically, the vertical alignment of the skeleton text relative to the circle icons is not correctly set. This could be due to incorrect margin, padding, or line-height settings in the CSS for the skeleton text or the container that holds both the circle and the text.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the skeleton state issue.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js
function: ProgressIndicatorSkeleton
function: Step
```

The `ProgressIndicatorSkeleton` function renders the skeleton state of the progress indicator, and the `Step` function renders individual skeleton steps. These functions are directly responsible for the skeleton text and circle icons, so they are relevant to the issue.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.stories.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the skeleton state issue.

#### `packages/react/src/components/SkeletonText/SkeletonText.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/SkeletonText/SkeletonText.js
function: function_2
```

The `function_2` (SkeletonText) is responsible for rendering the skeleton text. It is relevant because it generates the skeleton text that appears misaligned.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the skeleton state issue.
