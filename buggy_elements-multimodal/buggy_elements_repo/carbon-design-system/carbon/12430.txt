### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the dropdown implementation needs to support a read-only mode. The acceptance criteria specify that the component should be coded in `/package/react`, include a prop for read-only mode with associated styles, provide controls for each state in the playground, have a default story for easy copy and paste, and include RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the dropdown components (ComboBox, Dropdown, FluidDropdown, and Select) does not include a read-only mode. To address this, we need to:

- Add a `readOnly` prop to the components.
- Implement styles for the read-only state.
- Ensure the playground and stories include controls for the read-only state.
- Write RTL tests for the read-only class.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`

This file contains the ComboBox component, which is a type of dropdown. It needs to be updated to support the read-only mode.

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
function: function_5
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`

This file contains the Dropdown component, which is another type of dropdown. It also needs to be updated to support the read-only mode.

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
function: Dropdown
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.stories.js`

This file contains stories for the Dropdown component. It needs to be updated to include a story for the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
function: function_5
function: function_7
function: function_11
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/FluidDropdown/FluidDropdown.js`

This file contains the FluidDropdown component, which is a wrapper around the Dropdown component. It needs to be updated to support the read-only mode.

```
packages/react/src/components/FluidDropdown/FluidDropdown.js
function: FluidDropdown
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js`

This file contains the Select component, which is another type of dropdown. It needs to be updated to support the read-only mode.

```
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js
function: Select
```
