### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates two main issues:

1. **Accessible Name Mismatch**: When the `disable` knob is selected, the accessible name of the input does not match or contain the visible label text. This is a violation of accessibility standards.
2. **Missing Alternate Text for WAI-ARIA Widget**: When the `form validation` knob is selected, the WAI-ARIA widget with an `img` role is missing a non-empty alternate text or label.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Accessible Name Mismatch
- The accessible name of the input element is not correctly set to match or contain the visible label text. This could be due to incorrect or missing `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes.

#### Missing Alternate Text for WAI-ARIA Widget
- The SVG element used for the invalid icon is missing an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute, which is required for accessibility.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/FormLabel/FormLabel.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
class: NumberInput
```
The `NumberInput` class is responsible for rendering the number input field and its associated label. The accessible name mismatch issue likely stems from how the label and input are associated in this class.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/util.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js`
