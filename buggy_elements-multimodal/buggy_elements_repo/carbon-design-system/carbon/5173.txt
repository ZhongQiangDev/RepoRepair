### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that VoiceOver, a screen reader, incorrectly announces the current tab as "1 of 1" regardless of the actual number of tabs present. The expected behavior is for VoiceOver to announce the current tab's position relative to the total number of tabs, such as "1 of 4," "2 of 4," etc.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the lack of proper ARIA attributes or incorrect implementation of these attributes in the tab components. Specifically, the `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` attributes are essential for screen readers to announce the position of the current tab within the set of tabs. If these attributes are missing or not updated correctly, VoiceOver will not have the necessary information to announce the correct position.

The `Tab` class is responsible for rendering individual tabs and handling their interactions. It should include the necessary ARIA attributes (`aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize`) to ensure proper screen reader support.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```
The `Tabs` class manages the overall tab component, including the rendering of individual tabs and handling of tab selection. It should ensure that the necessary ARIA attributes are passed down to the individual `Tab` components.
