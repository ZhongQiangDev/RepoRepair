### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after searching for specific items in the DataTable and then clicking the "Select All" checkbox, all items in the table are selected instead of only the filtered (searched) items. The expectation is that only the items matching the search query should be selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the "Select All" functionality interacts with the filtered dataset. When the "Select All" checkbox is clicked, it seems to be selecting all rows in the original dataset rather than the filtered subset. This suggests that the selection logic is not correctly considering the current filtered state of the table.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`

This file contains the main `DataTable` class, which manages the table's state, including row selection. The `handleSelectAll` method is likely responsible for the "Select All" functionality. If this method does not account for the filtered rows, it could be the source of the issue.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/state/sorting.js`

This file contains functions related to sorting the table. While sorting is important for table functionality, it does not directly relate to the selection of rows. Therefore, this file is not relevant to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/tools/denormalize.js`

This file contains a function for denormalizing the table data. This function is used for reconstructing the table data structure but does not directly affect row selection. Thus, it is not relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/tools/filter.js`

This file contains the `defaultFilterRows` function, which is responsible for filtering the rows based on the search input. This function determines which rows are visible after a search, but it does not handle the selection of rows. However, the output of this function (the filtered row IDs) should be used by the selection logic to ensure only filtered rows are selected.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/tools/filter.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js`

This file contains the `Selection` class, which manages the selection of items. The `handleOnItemChange` and `handleSelectItem` methods are likely involved in managing individual row selections. However, the "Select All" functionality is more likely handled in the `DataTable` class itself.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
