### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the multiselect component is rendering a button inside another button, which violates the W3C HTML5 specification that states "there must be no interactive content descendant" for a button element. This can cause accessibility issues for screen reader and keyboard users.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the way the `ListBoxSelection` component is rendering its elements. Specifically, when there are selected items, it renders a filter tag with a close button inside it. This close button is likely being rendered as a button element, which results in a button inside another button.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js`

This file contains the `ListBoxSelection` component, which is responsible for rendering the selection controls. Based on the description, this component is likely the source of the issue because it dynamically renders either a filter tag (with a close button) or a standalone close button. The close button inside the filter tag is probably the nested button causing the problem.

```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js`

This file contains the `FilterableMultiSelect` class, which is a React component that combines a multi-select dropdown with filtering functionality. While this class manages the overall multi-select component, it does not directly handle the rendering of the selection controls. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the cause of the nested button issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect-story.js`

This file contains functions related to the Storybook configuration for the MultiSelect component. These functions are used to define props and render the component for documentation purposes. They do not directly handle the rendering of the selection controls and are not relevant to the nested button issue.

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js`

This file contains the `MultiSelect` component, which is a React forwardRef component that renders a multi-selection dropdown. While this component manages the overall multi-select functionality, it does not directly handle the rendering of the selection controls. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the cause of the nested button issue.
