### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the Checkbox component needs to support a read-only state. The current implementation lacks a `readOnly` prop and the associated styles for this state. Additionally, the playground controls and default story for the read-only state are missing, and RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop are not implemented.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of the `readOnly` prop in the `Checkbox` component's props interface (`CheckboxProps`). Without this prop, the component cannot be configured to be read-only. Furthermore, the styles for the read-only state are not defined, and the necessary controls and stories for the playground and documentation are not created. Lastly, the RTL tests for the read-only class are missing.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.stories.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```
- `function_1` (CheckboxStory): This function should be updated to include a read-only state in the story.
- `function_3` (Playground): This function should be updated to include a read-only state control in the playground.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx
function: CheckboxProps
function: function_2
```
- `CheckboxProps`: This interface should be updated to include the `readOnly` prop.
- `function_2`: This function should handle the `readOnly` prop and apply the appropriate styles.
