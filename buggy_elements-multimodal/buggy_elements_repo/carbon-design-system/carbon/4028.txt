### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves DAP (Dynamic Accessibility Protocol) violations when running DAP on the Combobox examples. The specific violations include:
- The `id` specified for WAI-ARIA properties `aria-owns`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-labelledby` is not valid.
- An interactive element/widget must have an accessible name.
- All content must reside within a WAI-ARIA landmark or labeled region role.
- The accessible name does not contain the visible label text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these violations likely stems from incorrect or missing ARIA attributes in the Combobox component. Specifically:
- The `id` values used for `aria-owns`, `aria-controls`, and `aria-labelledby` may not be correctly generated or referenced.
- The Combobox may not have a proper accessible name defined.
- The Combobox content may not be properly nested within a WAI-ARIA landmark or labeled region.
- The accessible name may not accurately reflect the visible label text.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One
