### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `FileUploaderButton` component has a DAP (Dynamic Accessibility Protocol) violation. Specifically, the `label` element within the `FileUploaderButton` has an invalid `role` attribute, which must reference a valid WAI-ARIA role.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the `role` attribute is being set on the `label` element within the `FileUploaderButton` component, but it is not set to a valid WAI-ARIA role. The `role` attribute is likely being passed as a prop to the `FileUploaderButton` component, and it is being applied to the `label` element without validation.
