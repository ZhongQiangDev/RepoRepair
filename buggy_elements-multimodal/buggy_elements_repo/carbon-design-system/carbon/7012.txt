### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the current button sizes not including the `xl` (80px height) and `large` (64px height) variants. The task is to add these new sizes to the button component to ensure consistency with the new creation flow pattern and modal buttons.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the existing button component does not support the `xl` and `large` size variants. This is likely due to the `size` prop in the `Button` component only supporting existing sizes like `small` and `field`. To fix this, the `Button` component needs to be updated to include the new sizes and their corresponding styles.

function: Button
```

The `Button` function is the main component that needs to be updated to include the new `xl` and `large` size variants. Specifically, the `size` prop should be extended to support these new sizes, and the corresponding CSS classes should be added to handle the new heights.
