### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the slider implementation needs to support a read-only mode. The current implementation lacks the necessary functionality and styling for a read-only state. Specifically, the following issues need to be addressed:

- The slider should have a read-only prop that can be set to disable user interaction.
- The slider should have specific styles applied when it is in read-only mode.
- The playground should include controls for toggling the read-only state.
- A default story should be provided for easy copy and paste.
- RTL tests should be added to ensure the read-only class is applied correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of the read-only functionality and styling in the current slider implementation. The `Slider` class and its associated functions do not currently support a read-only mode. Additionally, the stories and playground controls do not include options for demonstrating or testing the read-only state.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.js`

This file contains the `Slider` class and the `defaultFormatLabel` function. The `Slider` class needs to be updated to include the read-only functionality and styling.

```
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.js
class: Slider
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.stories.js`

This file contains various functions that render the slider in different configurations. These functions need to be updated to include a read-only state and controls for toggling it.

```
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_14
```

#### `packages/react/src/internal/useControllableState.js`

This file contains the `useControllableState` function, which manages state in controlled and uncontrolled components. This function may need to be updated to handle the read-only state if it affects state management.

```
packages/react/src/internal/useControllableState.js
function: useControllableState
```

#### `packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js`

This file contains the `requiredIfValueExists` function, which validates props. This function may need to be updated to handle the read-only state if it affects prop validation.

```
packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js
function: requiredIfValueExists
```

#### Other Files

The other files mentioned in the "Relevant Files Information" do not appear to be directly related to the read-only functionality and styling of the slider. Therefore, they do not need to be modified.
