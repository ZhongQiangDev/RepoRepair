### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the fluid text input component is missing a skeleton state. The skeleton state is a visual representation used to indicate that content is loading, providing a better user experience. The provided image shows the expected skeleton state for a text input, which includes a background, border-bottom, and text styling.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the `FluidTextInput` component does not currently include a skeleton state. This means that when the component is in a loading state, it does not display the skeleton styling as shown in the image. To fix this, the skeleton state needs to be added to the `FluidTextInput` component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/FluidForm/FluidForm.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/FluidTextInput/FluidTextInput.stories.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in this file is the `TextInputSkeleton` component, which renders a skeleton loading state for a text input. This component can be adapted or used as a reference to implement the skeleton state for the `FluidTextInput` component.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/next/TextInput.stories.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js` is the `TextInputSkeleton` component, which is relevant for implementing the skeleton state for the `FluidTextInput` component. The other files do not contain relevant functions or classes for this specific issue.
