### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `flexBasis` rule does not work as expected after upgrading from version 1.6.14 to 2.0.8. Specifically, the text elements "One," "Two," and "Three" are not being laid out according to their specified `flexBasis` values of "50%," "25%," and "25%," respectively. Instead, they are displayed in a single line without any spacing or sizing based on the `flexBasis` values.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in how the `flexBasis` property is handled in version 2.0.8. The `flexBasis` property is responsible for defining the initial main size of a flex item. If it's not working as expected, it could be due to:

- A bug in the implementation of `flexBasis` in the new version.
- Changes in how percentage values are interpreted or applied.
- Issues with the underlying layout engine (Yoga) in handling `flexBasis`.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js

This file contains the `setYogaValue` function, which is responsible for setting Yoga properties on a node. Since `flexBasis` is a Yoga property, this function is directly relevant to the issue.

```
packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
function: function_1
```

#### packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js

This file contains several functions related to resolving dimensions and layout, but none of them directly handle the `flexBasis` property. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js

This file contains the `processFlexBasis` function, which processes the `flexBasis` value. This function is relevant because it determines how the `flexBasis` value is handled before being passed to the layout engine.

```
packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
function: function_17
```

#### Other Files

The other files in the provided information do not contain functions or classes directly related to the `flexBasis` property or its handling. Therefore, they are not relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
