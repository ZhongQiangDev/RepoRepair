### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when setting a border on a rounded `<View>` element, the border does not render correctly as the `borderRadius` increases. Specifically:

- When `borderRadius` is set to 1, the border mostly goes around the view.
- As `borderRadius` increases, the border starts to have issues, such as not being properly rounded or overlapping in strange ways.
- At higher `borderRadius` values (e.g., 20 or 30), the border rendering becomes increasingly distorted and incorrect.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the border is being drawn around the rounded corners of the `<View>` element. The `drawBorders` function in the `borders.js` mixin is responsible for drawing the borders, and it uses `drawHorizontalBorder` and `drawVerticalBorder` functions to draw the borders with rounded corners. The problem may be related to how these functions handle the calculation and drawing of the rounded corners, especially when the `borderRadius` is large.
