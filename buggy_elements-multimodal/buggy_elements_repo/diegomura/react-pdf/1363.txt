### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `rgba` color does not work correctly when applied to the `Text` component. Specifically, the color or background color set using `rgba` for the `Text` component does not render as expected, unlike the `View` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from how the `rgba` color is being parsed, transformed, or applied to the `Text` component. The `rgba` color might not be correctly interpreted or applied in the rendering process, leading to unexpected results. This could be due to differences in how the `Text` and `View` components handle color properties or how the color values are processed before rendering.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/render/src/primitives/renderBackground.js ---
This file contains functions related to rendering backgrounds, which might be relevant if the issue involves background colors. However, since the problem is specifically about the `Text` component, this file is less likely to be directly relevant unless the background color is affecting the text color.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/render/src/primitives/renderText.js ---
This file contains the `renderText` function, which is directly responsible for rendering text. The issue might be related to how the color is applied to the text within this function.

```
packages/render/src/primitives/renderText.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- packages/stylesheet/src/colors.js ---
This file contains functions for transforming color values, which could be relevant if the `rgba` color is not being correctly transformed or parsed.

```
packages/stylesheet/src/colors.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```

#### --- packages/stylesheet/src/resolve.js ---
This file contains the `resolveStyles` function, which processes and transforms style objects. If the `rgba` color is not being correctly resolved or transformed, this could be a relevant file.

```
packages/stylesheet/src/resolve.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- packages/textkit/src/layout/applyDefaultStyles.js ---
This file contains functions for applying default styles to text, which could be relevant if default styles are interfering with the `rgba` color.

```
packages/textkit/src/layout/applyDefaultStyles.js
function: function_1
```
