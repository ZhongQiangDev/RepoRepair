### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `scratch-blocks` devDependency has been updated from `0.1.0-prerelease.1542223417` to `0.1.0-prerelease.1542293672`. The issue is that this new version is not covered by the current version range specified in the project's configuration (likely `package.json`). This means that the project will not automatically update to this new version unless the version range is adjusted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the version range specified for the `scratch-blocks` dependency in the project's configuration file (likely `package.json`) is too restrictive. The version range does not include the new version `0.1.0-prerelease.1542293672`, so the project will not automatically update to this version. To fix this, the version range needs to be updated to include the new version.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `webpack.config.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/components/library-item/library-item.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/containers/blocks.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/containers/extension-library.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the issue described in the GitHub problem description. The issue is related to the version range specified for the `scratch-blocks` dependency in the project's configuration file, which is not included in the provided files. Therefore, the relevant file to inspect or edit would be the project's configuration file, likely `package.json`, to update the version range for the `scratch-blocks` dependency.
