### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the navigation bar needs to be designed and integrated into the GUI. The current issue is that the navigation bar is not yet implemented or integrated, and most of its features are marked as "Coming Soon."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of a navigation bar component in the current codebase. The GUI component (`gui.jsx`) and the menu bar component (`menu-bar.jsx`) are present, but there is no specific navigation bar component that is integrated into the GUI. The navigation bar is likely a missing component that needs to be designed and integrated.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/components/box/box.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/components/button/button.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/components/gui/gui.jsx`
```
src/components/gui/gui.jsx
function: function_1
```
The `GUIComponent` function in `gui.jsx` is responsible for rendering the main GUI structure. It currently includes a `MenuBar` but does not have a navigation bar. The navigation bar should be integrated here.

#### `src/components/language-selector/language-selector.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/components/menu-bar/menu-bar.jsx`
```
src/components/menu-bar/menu-bar.jsx
function: function_1
```
The `MenuBar` function in `menu-bar.jsx` is responsible for rendering the menu bar. While it is not the navigation bar, it is a related component that could be modified or extended to include navigation bar functionality.
