### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the setting switches, which use buttons with icons (e.g., the shown/hidden switch or the rotation style setting), rely on color to indicate the active state. This makes it difficult for colorblind users to distinguish between the active and inactive states when the interface is viewed in grayscale.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the current implementation uses color (colored-in versus grayed-out) as the primary indicator for the active state of the buttons. This approach fails to provide sufficient contrast for colorblind users, who may not be able to distinguish between the colors. The solution proposed is to change the background color of the buttons to provide a more distinct visual cue that is easier for colorblind users to perceive.
