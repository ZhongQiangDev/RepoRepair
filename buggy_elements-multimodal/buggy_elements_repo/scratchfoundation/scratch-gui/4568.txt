### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in Scratch 3.0, the min/max range for slider monitors is fixed at 0-100, whereas in Scratch 2.0, the min/max range can be customized by right-clicking the slider monitor. This limitation prevents users from setting custom ranges for sliders in Scratch 3.0, which was possible in Scratch 2.0.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the implementation of the slider monitor in Scratch 3.0. Specifically, the code responsible for rendering and managing the slider monitor does not allow for customization of the min/max range. This could be due to the absence of a mechanism to handle user input for setting custom ranges or the lack of a corresponding state in the Redux store to store these custom values.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/components/monitor/monitor.jsx`

This file contains the `MonitorComponent`, which is responsible for rendering the monitor based on the `props.mode` value. Since the issue is related to the slider monitor's range, this file is relevant because it handles the rendering of the slider monitor.

```
src/components/monitor/monitor.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### `src/containers/monitor-list.jsx`

This file contains functions and a class related to managing a list of monitors. It does not directly handle the rendering or configuration of individual monitors, so it is not directly relevant to the issue of customizing the slider range.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/containers/monitor.jsx`

This file contains functions and a class related to managing individual monitors. The `Monitor` class is responsible for rendering and managing the monitor, including handling different modes like 'slider'. This file is relevant because it handles the rendering and interaction with the slider monitor.

```
src/containers/monitor.jsx
class: Monitor
```

#### `src/lib/monitor-adapter.js`

This file contains functions for processing monitor objects. While it processes the properties of monitors, it does not directly handle the rendering or configuration of the slider range. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/reducers/monitor-layout.js`

This file contains functions for managing the state of monitor rectangles, including adding, moving, resizing, and removing monitors. While it manages the layout and position of monitors, it does not handle the configuration of the slider range. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
