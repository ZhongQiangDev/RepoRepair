### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the current version of the `scratch-vm` dependency is outdated. The latest version `0.1.0-prerelease.1513710334-prerelease.1513710351` is not covered by the current version range. This means that the project is missing out on new features, fixes, and performance improvements that come with the updated version of `scratch-vm`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the version range specified for the `scratch-vm` dependency in the project's configuration files (likely `package.json`) does not include the latest version. This could be due to a fixed version number, a version range that is too restrictive, or a lack of an update mechanism for dependencies.
