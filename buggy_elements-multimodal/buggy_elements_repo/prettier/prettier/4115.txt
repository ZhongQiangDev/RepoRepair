### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a user saves a Markdown file containing nested code blocks or raw HTML, the formatting on save feature in Prettier (used in VS Code) adds extra indentation each time the file is saved. This results in the nested content being pushed further out of alignment with each save, breaking the intended indentation structure.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from how Prettier handles indentation for nested content within Markdown files. Specifically, it seems that Prettier is not correctly recognizing the intended indentation level for the nested HTML or code blocks, leading it to apply additional indentation each time the file is saved. This could be due to a few potential issues:

- **Incorrect Indentation Detection**: Prettier might be misinterpreting the indentation level of the nested content, causing it to add extra indentation.
- **Formatting Rules for Nested Content**: The rules Prettier uses for formatting nested content within Markdown files might not be properly configured or might conflict with the intended structure.
- **Interaction with Markdown Syntax**: There could be an issue with how Prettier interacts with Markdown syntax when formatting nested HTML or code blocks.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

```
src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
function: genericPrint
function: printChildren
function: printTable
function: printListItem
function: printUrl
```

The `genericPrint` function is responsible for processing and formatting various Markdown elements, including lists, tables, and inline code. It might be relevant to the issue if it is not correctly handling the indentation of nested content.

The `printChildren` function processes the children of an AST node and applies formatting rules. If it is not correctly managing the indentation of nested content, it could contribute to the problem.

The `printTable` function specifically handles the formatting of tables. If it is not correctly maintaining the indentation of tables within other Markdown elements, it could be a factor in the issue.

The `printListItem` function formats list items and might be relevant if it is not correctly handling the indentation of nested content within list items.

The `printUrl` function formats URLs and might be relevant if it is not correctly handling the indentation of URLs within nested content.
