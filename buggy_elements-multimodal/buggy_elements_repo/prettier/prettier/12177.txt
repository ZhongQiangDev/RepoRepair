### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `default` case in the `switch` statement is not preserving the comment as expected. Specifically, the comment `// expression;` is being moved to the next line after the `default` keyword, whereas the `case` statement's comment `// impl<T> Growling<T> for Wolf {}` is preserved on the same line.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prettier handles comments in `switch` statements. Specifically, it seems that Prettier's comment handling logic treats `default` cases differently from `case` statements. This could be due to how the comment attachment logic is implemented for `default` cases versus `case` statements.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/common/util.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/language-js/clean.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/language-js/comments.js ---
```
src/language-js/comments.js
function: handleEndOfLineComment
function: handleOnlyComments
function: handleRemainingComment
```

These functions are likely involved in determining where comments should be attached in the AST. The issue might be related to how these functions handle comments in `default` cases versus `case` statements.

#### --- src/language-js/needs-parens.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/language-js/printer-estree.js ---
```
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
function: genericPrint
function: printPathNoParens
```

These functions are responsible for printing the AST nodes, including handling comments. The issue might be related to how these functions handle the printing of comments in `default` cases versus `case` statements.
