### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the WebGL renderer incorrectly expects the source to have a tile grid when using `ol/layer/WebGLTile` with sources that use view projection with `wrapX` set to `false`. This results in the WebGLTileLayer not functioning as expected, unlike the `ol/layer/Tile` layer.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the WebGLTileLayer's assumption that a tile grid is always present, which may not be the case for sources with `wrapX` set to `false`. The WebGLTileLayer might be relying on the tile grid for certain calculations or operations that are not compatible with sources that do not wrap around the X-axis. This could lead to incorrect rendering or failure to render the tiles properly.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/tilegrid.js
```
src/ol/tilegrid.js
function: wrapX
```
The `wrapX` function is directly related to the issue since it handles the wrapping of tile coordinates along the X-axis. If `wrapX` is set to `false`, the WebGLTileLayer might not handle the tile coordinates correctly, leading to the described problem.

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
```
The `WebGLTileLayer` class is directly involved in the rendering process and might be making assumptions about the presence of a tile grid. This class needs to be examined to ensure it handles sources with `wrapX` set to `false` correctly.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
function: getRenderExtent
function: depthForZ
function: addTileTextureToLookup
```
The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class and the `getRenderExtent`, `depthForZ`, and `addTileTextureToLookup` functions are relevant because they manage the rendering process, depth calculations, and tile texture management, which may need to be adjusted to handle sources with `wrapX` set to `false`.
