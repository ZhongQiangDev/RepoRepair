### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Y position of the bottom of the icons changes when the `scale` option is modified, even though the `displacement` option is set to keep the icons at the same Y position. This suggests that the `scale` and `displacement` options may not be working independently as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `scale` and `displacement` properties are applied to the icon's position. When scaling an icon, the displacement might not be correctly adjusted to maintain the bottom alignment. This could be due to the order of operations in the transformation process or how the displacement is calculated relative to the scaled dimensions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/transform.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/style/flat.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
```

The `Icon` class is directly related to the issue because it handles the scaling and displacement of icons. The `scale` and `displacement` properties are likely managed within this class.

#### `src/ol/style/IconImage.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/style/Image.js`

```
src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
```

The `ImageStyle` class is relevant because it is the base class for `Icon` and manages common properties like `scale` and `displacement`. The issue might be related to how these properties are handled in the base class.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon

src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
