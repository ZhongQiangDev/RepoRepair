### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when vector layer text styles with non-zero rotation values are clipped and translated, they do not appear at the correct translated location. Instead, they appear at their original location on the map. This issue only occurs with rotated text styles, while non-rotated text styles are correctly translated.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the rotation transformation is applied to the text styles during the clipping and translation process. When a rotation is applied, the transformation matrix used for translation may not correctly account for the rotation, leading to the text being rendered at the original location rather than the translated one. This suggests a problem with the transformation matrix calculations or the application of the rotation transformation.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/transform.js`

This file contains functions related to transformation matrices, which are crucial for applying transformations like translation and rotation. The issue likely involves incorrect handling of rotation in the transformation matrix.

```
src/ol/transform.js
function: compose
function: apply
function: rotate
function: multiply
function: set
```

#### `src/ol/render/canvas.js`

This file contains functions related to rendering images and labels on a canvas, including transformations and rotations. The issue may involve incorrect application of transformations during rendering.

```
src/ol/render/canvas.js
function: drawImageOrLabel
function: rotateAtOffset
function: measureTextWidth
function: measureText
function: getTextDimensions
```

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js`

This file contains the `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class, which handles immediate rendering of vector data to a canvas. The issue may involve incorrect handling of transformations during immediate rendering.

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
class: CanvasImmediateRenderer
```

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js`

This file contains the `CanvasVectorLayerRenderer` class, which handles rendering of vector layers using HTML5 Canvas. The issue may involve incorrect handling of transformations during vector layer rendering.

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js
class: CanvasVectorLayerRenderer
```

#### `src/ol/style/Text.js`

This file contains the `Text` class, which handles text styling properties for vector features. The issue may involve incorrect handling of rotation properties in the text style.

```
src/ol/style/Text.js
class: Text
```
