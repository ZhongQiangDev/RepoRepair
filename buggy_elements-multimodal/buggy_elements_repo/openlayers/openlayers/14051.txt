### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect use of `layer.getMinZoom()` in the `TileLayer.js` file. Specifically, `layer.getMinZoom()` is used as if it directly corresponds to a tile grid zoom level, which it does not. This can lead to tiles not being loaded correctly, especially in cases where the tile grid is smaller than the view.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the misunderstanding of the relationship between `layer.getMinZoom()` and the tile grid zoom levels. `layer.getMinZoom()` returns a view zoom level, which is not directly equivalent to the zoom levels used by the tile grid. Using `layer.getMinZoom()` directly as a tile grid index can result in incorrect tile loading because the view zoom level and the tile grid zoom level may not align perfectly. To fix this, the code should either remove the incorrect usage or replace it with a calculation that properly maps the view zoom level to the tile grid zoom level using `tileGrid.getZForResolution()` or `view.getResolutionForZoom(layer.getMinZoom())`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js

This file contains the problematic code. The function `addTileTextureToLookup` and potentially other functions may be using `layer.getMinZoom()` incorrectly.

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
function: addTileTextureToLookup
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```

#### src/ol/layer/Layer.js

This file contains the `Layer` class and the `inView` function, which correctly uses `layer.getMinZoom()` in the context of view zoom levels. This file does not contain the problematic code but is relevant for understanding the correct usage of `layer.getMinZoom()`.

```
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
function: inView
class: Layer
```

#### src/ol/source/XYZ.js

This file contains the `XYZ` class, which is related to tile sources but does not directly interact with the problematic code. It does not contain any relevant functions or classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/source/Zoomify.js

This file contains the `Zoomify` class and the `CustomTile` class, which are related to tile sources but do not directly interact with the problematic code. It does not contain any relevant functions or classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js

This file contains the `TileGrid` class, which is relevant because it provides methods for managing tile grids and calculating zoom levels. The `getZForResolution` method is particularly relevant for fixing the issue.

```
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
class: TileGrid
```
