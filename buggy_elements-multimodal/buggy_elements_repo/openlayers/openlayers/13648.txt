### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when loading a COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) in OpenLayers, only the upper part of the image is displayed, while the lower part is missing. This suggests an issue with how the image is being rendered or how the extent of the image is being calculated.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be related to how the extent of the COG is being calculated or how the image is being reprojected and rendered. Possible causes include:
- Incorrect calculation of the image's bounding box or extent.
- Issues with the reprojection of the image from its source projection to the target projection.
- Problems with the way the image tiles are being loaded and stitched together.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/extent.js`

This file contains functions related to the calculation and manipulation of extents. Given the issue described, the following functions could be relevant:

```
src/ol/extent.js
function: getBoundingBox
function: getIntersection
function: getIntersectionArea
function: intersects
function: wrapAndSliceX
```

These functions are involved in calculating and manipulating extents, which could be relevant if the issue is related to incorrect extent calculations.

#### `src/ol/geom/flat/transform.js`

This file contains functions for transforming flat coordinates. While it is less likely to be directly related to the issue, it could still be relevant if there are problems with coordinate transformations:

```
src/ol/geom/flat/transform.js
function: transform2D
function: rotate
function: scale
function: translate
```

#### `src/ol/reproj/Image.js`

This file contains the `ReprojImage` class, which handles the reprojection of images. This is highly relevant to the issue:

```
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
class: ReprojImage
```

#### `src/ol/reproj/Tile.js`

This file contains the `ReprojTile` class, which manages the reprojection of tiles. This is also highly relevant:

```
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
class: ReprojTile
```

#### `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js`

This file contains the `GeoTIFFSource` class and related functions for handling GeoTIFF data. This is directly relevant to the issue:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
function: getBoundingBox
function: getImagesForSource
function: getImagesForTIFF
function: getProjection
function: getResolution
```

### Summary

```
src/ol/extent.js
function: getBoundingBox

function: getIntersectionArea
function: intersects
function: wrapAndSliceX
