### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `WebGLPointsLayer` does not correctly respect the `useGeographic()` function when rendering points. Specifically, when `useGeographic()` is enabled, the points are plotted at incorrect locations (near Africa), indicating that the layer is not properly handling the geographic coordinates in EPSG:4326.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the `WebGLPointsLayer` handles coordinate transformations when `useGeographic()` is enabled. When `useGeographic()` is called, it sets the user projection to EPSG:4326. However, if the `WebGLPointsLayer` does not correctly apply this projection when rendering points, it will default to using EPSG:3857, leading to incorrect point placement.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/proj.js

```
src/ol/proj.js
function: useGeographic
function: getUserProjection
function: transform
function: addCoordinateTransforms
function: addEquivalentTransforms
```

These functions are relevant because `useGeographic()` sets the user projection to EPSG:4326, and the `transform` function is responsible for converting coordinates between projections. The `addCoordinateTransforms` and `addEquivalentTransforms` functions manage the transformation functions between different projections.

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js
class: WebGLPointsLayer
```

The `WebGLPointsLayer` class is relevant because it is responsible for rendering the points and should handle the coordinate transformations correctly based on the user projection.

#### src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js

```
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
function: fromEPSG4326
function: toEPSG4326
```

These functions are relevant because they handle the transformation between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3857, which is crucial when `useGeographic()` is enabled.

#### src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js

```
src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js
class: EPSG4326Projection
```

The `EPSG4326Projection` class is relevant because it defines the properties and behavior of the EPSG:4326 projection, which is set as the user projection when `useGeographic()` is called.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js
class: WebGLPointsLayerRenderer
```

The `WebGLPointsLayerRenderer` class is relevant because it handles the actual rendering of points using WebGL and should correctly apply the coordinate transformations based on the user projection.
