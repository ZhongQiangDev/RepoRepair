### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `TileDebug` layer does not correctly represent the inverted Y coordinate (`{-y}`) for the `TileImage` layer. Specifically, the coordinates in the `TileDebug` layer do not match the coordinates used in the `TileImage` layer when the Y coordinate is inverted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `TileDebug` layer handles the Y coordinate when it is inverted. The `TileImage` layer is configured to use an inverted Y coordinate (`{-y}`) in its URL template, but the `TileDebug` layer does not account for this inversion when generating its tile coordinates. As a result, the coordinates displayed in the `TileDebug` layer do not align with the actual coordinates used by the `TileImage` layer.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/tilecoord.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/ol/source/TileDebug.js
```
src/ol/source/TileDebug.js
class: TileDebug
```
The `TileDebug` class is responsible for rendering the tile grid and displaying coordinates. It needs to be modified to handle the inverted Y coordinate correctly.

#### src/ol/source/TileImage.js
```
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
class: TileImage
```
The `TileImage` class manages the image tiles and handles the inverted Y coordinate in its URL template. It is relevant because it defines how the Y coordinate is inverted.
