### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `ol.layer.WebGLTile` layer does not render data loaded with `ol.source.DataTile` using a custom tile grid. The issue is indicated by the black tiles and the WebGL warning message:

```
WebGL warning: texImage: Desired upload requires more data than is available: (767 rows plus 770 pixels needed, 767 rows plus 258 pixels available)
```

This suggests that there is a mismatch between the expected and available data when uploading textures to WebGL.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely stems from a discrepancy in the tile size or data dimensions when uploading the texture to WebGL. The warning indicates that the WebGL texture upload expects more data than is actually available, which could be due to:

- Incorrect tile size calculations.
- Mismatch between the tile grid configuration and the actual data dimensions.
- Issues with the data loading or processing pipeline that result in incomplete or incorrectly formatted data.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/DataTile.js
```
src/ol/DataTile.js
class: DataTile
```
The `DataTile` class is responsible for handling the loading and management of tile data. It is relevant because it manages the data that is eventually passed to WebGL for rendering.

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
```
The `WebGLTileLayer` class is responsible for rendering tiles using WebGL. It is directly involved in the rendering process and could be where the issue with texture upload occurs.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```
The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class handles the actual rendering of tiles using WebGL. It is responsible for uploading textures and managing the rendering pipeline, making it a key component to inspect.

#### src/ol/source/DataTile.js
```
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
class: DataTileSource
```
The `DataTileSource` class manages the tile grid and data loading. It is relevant because it sets up the tile grid and provides the data that is used by the `DataTile` class.

#### src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
class: TileTexture
function: uploadDataTexture
function: uploadImageTexture
```
The `TileTexture` class and its methods `uploadDataTexture` and `uploadImageTexture` are responsible for uploading tile data to WebGL textures. These functions are critical for ensuring that the correct data is uploaded with the right dimensions.

### Summary of Relevant Files and Functions/Classes

- `src/ol/DataTile.js`: `DataTile` class
- `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`: `WebGLTileLayer` class
- `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js`: `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class
- `src/ol/source/DataTile.js`: `DataTileSource` class
- `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js`: `TileTexture` class, `uploadDataTexture` function, `uploadImageTexture` function

These files and their components are directly involved in the tile data management, rendering pipeline, and texture upload process, making them the primary areas to inspect and potentially edit to resolve the issue.
