### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the labels on the graticule grid show irregular intervals (e.g., 3', 3'.01", 2'.59"), while the grid lines themselves appear to be regular. This inconsistency between the visual grid and the label intervals is unexpected and potentially confusing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The irregular intervals in the labels likely stem from how the labels are calculated and formatted. The labels are derived from the coordinates of the grid lines, and if these coordinates are not rounded or formatted consistently, the labels may display fractional seconds that do not align with the regular intervals of the grid lines. This could be due to floating-point arithmetic precision issues or incorrect rounding in the label formatting process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/coordinate.js ---
This file contains functions related to coordinate manipulation and formatting, which are relevant to the issue of label formatting.

```
src/ol/coordinate.js
function: degreesToStringHDMS
function: toStringHDMS
function: createStringXY
```

#### --- src/ol/string.js ---
This file contains functions related to string formatting, which could be relevant if the issue involves string formatting of the labels.

```
src/ol/string.js
function: padNumber
```

#### --- src/ol/layer/Graticule.js ---
This file contains the `Graticule` class, which is directly responsible for rendering the graticule grid and labels. It is highly relevant to the issue.

```
src/ol/layer/Graticule.js
class: Graticule
```

#### --- Other Files ---
The other files in the provided information do not seem directly relevant to the issue of label formatting in the graticule grid.
