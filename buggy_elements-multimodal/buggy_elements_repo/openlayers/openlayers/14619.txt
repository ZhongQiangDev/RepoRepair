### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an `Icon` is cloned, the scale value of the cloned `Icon` becomes an array instead of a number, even if the original `Icon` had a scale value set as a number. This results in incorrect scaling of the cloned `Icon`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the way the `Icon` class handles the `scale` attribute during the cloning process. When an `Icon` is cloned, the constructor is called again, and if the `scale` attribute is an array, it is treated as a pair of scaling factors for width and height. However, if the original `Icon` had a single number as its `scale`, this number should be preserved in the cloned `Icon` as well. The issue arises because the cloning process might be converting the single number scale into an array, leading to incorrect scaling.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/style/Icon.js ---
This file contains the `Icon` class, which is directly related to the problem. The `Icon` class has a `scale` attribute and a `clone` method. The `calculateScale` function might also be relevant if it is used during the cloning process.

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
function: calculateScale
class: Icon
```

#### --- src/ol/style/IconImage.js ---
This file contains the `IconImage` class and the `get` function. These are not directly related to the cloning of `Icon` styles or the handling of the `scale` attribute.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/ol/style/Image.js ---
This file contains the `ImageStyle` class, which is the parent class of `Icon`. The `clone` method in `ImageStyle` might be relevant if it is overridden or used by the `Icon` class.

```
src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
```

#### --- src/ol/style/RegularShape.js ---
This file contains the `RegularShape` class, which is not directly related to the `Icon` class or the `scale` attribute handling.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/ol/style/Style.js ---
This file contains the `Style` class and several functions related to style creation and manipulation. The `Style` class has a `clone` method, but it is not directly related to the `Icon` class or the `scale` attribute handling.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
