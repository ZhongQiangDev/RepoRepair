### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the inability to set a custom WebGL blending function for a subset of WebGL Tile Layers in OpenLayers. Specifically, the user needs to blend with `gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE, gl.ONE)` for certain Tile Layers, but the current API does not provide a way to set different blending options for WebGL rendering.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the WebGL rendering pipeline in OpenLayers does not expose a mechanism to customize the blending function for individual WebGL Tile Layers. The blending function is currently hardcoded or set at a higher level that applies uniformly to all layers, rather than being configurable per layer.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
function: parseStyle
```
The `WebGLTileLayer` class manages the WebGL rendering of tile layers and could be extended to include a blending function flag. The `parseStyle` function is where the WebGL shaders and uniforms are generated, and it could be modified to incorporate the blending function.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```
The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class handles the actual WebGL rendering of tiles. It would need to be updated to respect the blending function specified in the layer's style.

#### src/ol/style/Style.js
```
src/ol/style/Style.js
class: Style
```
The `Style` class is where the layer's style is defined. It could be extended to include a blending function property that can be set for WebGL layers.

#### src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
```
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
class: WebGLHelper
```
The `WebGLHelper` class manages WebGL operations, including blending. It would need to be modified to allow for different blending functions based on the layer's style.

#### src/ol/source/DataTile.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `DataTileSource` class is related to tile data management but does not directly handle WebGL rendering or blending.

#### src/ol/source/TileImage.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TileImage` class manages image tiles but does not directly handle WebGL rendering or blending.
