### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that a perfectly square image is being stretched unnecessarily when scaled to fit a square tile extent due to rounding errors. This results in the image losing detail because one dimension is reduced while the other is scaled up. The use of `Math.ceil` is suspected to be a contributing factor.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the problem appears to be related to the scaling calculations within the `Static` class in `src/ol/source/ImageStatic.js`. The use of `Math.ceil` in the scaling logic is likely causing the image dimensions to be rounded up, leading to unnecessary stretching. The goal is to scale up whichever dimension needs it instead of reducing width, which would eliminate the need for `Math.ceil` and result in a more accurate fit within the extent.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/ol/source/ImageStatic.js
class: Static
```

The `Static` class in `src/ol/source/ImageStatic.js` is the primary location that needs inspection and editing to fix the rounding error issue. The scaling logic within this class is likely where the problem originates, and adjustments to the scaling calculations should be made to ensure the image fits the extent accurately without unnecessary stretching.
