### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the WMS image appears blurry when the ratio is not a round integer or when the map width or height is not even. This suggests that the image is not being rendered pixel-perfectly, likely due to improper scaling or handling of non-integer ratios.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The blurriness likely stems from improper handling of image scaling and resolution when the ratio is not an integer or when the dimensions are not even. This could be due to:
- Incorrect calculation of the image resolution or extent.
- Improper scaling of the image during rendering.
- Inaccurate handling of pixel ratios, especially in high-DPI displays.
- Issues with the image loading and decoding process that do not account for non-integer ratios.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/Image.js

```
src/ol/Image.js
function: decode
function: decodeFallback
class: ImageWrapper
```

The `decode` and `decodeFallback` functions handle image loading and decoding, which could be relevant if there are issues with image scaling or resolution. The `ImageWrapper` class manages image loading and state, which might also be involved in ensuring the image is rendered correctly.

#### src/ol/ImageBase.js

```
src/ol/ImageBase.js
class: ImageBase
```

The `ImageBase` class provides common properties and methods for image handling, including resolution and pixel ratio. These could be relevant if there are issues with how the image's resolution is managed.

#### src/ol/render.js

```
src/ol/render.js
function: function_1
function: getRenderPixel
function: getVectorContext
function: renderDeclutterItems
function: toContext
```

The `function_1` (ol.render.toContext) sets up the canvas context and scales it based on the pixel ratio, which is crucial for high-DPI displays. `getRenderPixel` and `getVectorContext` handle transformations and rendering, which could be relevant if there are issues with pixel alignment. `renderDeclutterItems` and `toContext` manage rendering processes that might affect image quality.

#### src/ol/reproj.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file primarily deal with reprojection and rendering of triangles, which are not directly related to the blurriness issue described.

#### src/ol/source/ImageWMS.js

```
src/ol/source/ImageWMS.js
class: ImageWMS
```

The `ImageWMS` class handles WMS image requests and could be relevant if there are issues with how the image is fetched or scaled based on the WMS parameters.
