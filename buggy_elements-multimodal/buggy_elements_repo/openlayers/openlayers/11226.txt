### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when editing a `GeometryCollection` containing multiple geometries, the interaction does not work correctly. Specifically, when dragging a common vertex of two polygons within a `GeometryCollection`, the polygons do not behave as expected. Instead of maintaining their shared vertex and moving together, they deform in an unexpected manner, as shown in the video.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `GeometryCollection` handles the shared vertices of its constituent geometries during the modification process. When a vertex is dragged, the `Modify` interaction should update all geometries that share that vertex. However, the current implementation may not correctly propagate the changes to all relevant geometries within the `GeometryCollection`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/geom/Geometry.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/geom/GeometryCollection.js`

```
src/ol/geom/GeometryCollection.js
class: GeometryCollection
function: cloneGeometries
```

The `GeometryCollection` class is directly involved in managing a collection of geometries. The `cloneGeometries` function is used to create deep copies of geometries, which might be relevant if the issue involves incorrect cloning or updating of geometries during modification.

#### `src/ol/interaction/Modify.js`

```
src/ol/interaction/Modify.js
class: Modify
function: closestOnSegmentData
function: compareIndexes
function: getDefaultStyleFunction
function: pointDistanceToSegmentDataSquared
```

The `Modify` class is responsible for modifying geometries, and its methods are directly involved in the interaction process. The `closestOnSegmentData` function calculates the closest point on a segment, which is crucial for determining which vertex is being dragged. The `compareIndexes` function may be relevant if the issue involves sorting or ordering of segments. The `getDefaultStyleFunction` and `pointDistanceToSegmentDataSquared` functions are also involved in the interaction process.

#### `src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/renderer/vector.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
