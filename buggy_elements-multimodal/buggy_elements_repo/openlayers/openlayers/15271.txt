### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the current style expressions in the codebase support fetching a feature property using `['get', 'attributeName']`, but they do not support fetching the feature's `id` using a similar expression. The user wants to access the feature's `id` without duplicating it in the properties collection.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the current expression system does not include a mechanism to access the feature's `id` directly. The `['get', 'attributeName']` expression is designed to retrieve properties from the feature's properties collection, but the `id` is stored separately and is not accessible through this mechanism.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/Feature.js`

```
src/ol/Feature.js
class: Feature
```

The `Feature` class contains the `id_` attribute, which stores the feature's identifier. This class is relevant because it holds the `id` that needs to be accessible through an expression.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/style.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to building and evaluating style components like fill, stroke, text, and images. They do not directly relate to feature property or `id` access.

#### `src/ol/style/expressions.js`

```
src/ol/style/expressions.js
function: buildExpression
```

The `buildExpression` function is responsible for constructing evaluators for various types of expressions. To support accessing the feature's `id`, this function would need to be extended to recognize a new expression type, such as `['getId']`, which would retrieve the feature's `id`.

#### `src/ol/style/flat.js`

```
src/ol/style/flat.js
function: getImage
function: getFill
function: getStroke
function: getText
function: toStyle
```

These functions are related to constructing style objects from flat style literals. While they are not directly responsible for feature property access, they are part of the style system that would need to be updated to support new expressions that access the feature's `id`.
