### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using proj4js definitions with OpenLayers, the resulting projection is invalid. Specifically:
- Required parameters like `units` are undefined.
- The `axisOrientation` is set to an incorrect default value ("enu" instead of "neu").
- This results in broken map display/projection when using the defined projection.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to how OpenLayers processes proj4js definitions:
- When proj4js definitions are registered with OpenLayers, it seems that OpenLayers does not correctly interpret or set the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties.
- The default values for these properties are not being overridden by the proj4js definition, leading to incorrect projection behavior.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/proj.js`

```
src/ol/proj.js
function: register
function: addProjection
function: createProjection
function: equivalent
function: get
```

- `register`: This function is responsible for synchronizing projection definitions between proj4js and OpenLayers. It may not be correctly setting the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties.
- `addProjection`: This function adds a projection to the list of supported projections. It might not be handling the proj4js definitions correctly.
- `createProjection`: This function creates a projection object. It may need to ensure that `units` and `axisOrientation` are properly set.
- `equivalent`: This function checks if two projections are equivalent. It might need to consider the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties.
- `get`: This function retrieves a projection based on a code. It might need to ensure that the retrieved projection has the correct properties.

#### `src/ol/proj/proj4.js`

```
src/ol/proj/proj4.js
function: register
function: fromEPSGCode
function: epsgLookup
```

- `register`: This function registers proj4js definitions with OpenLayers. It may need to ensure that the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties are correctly set.
- `fromEPSGCode`: This function retrieves a projection definition based on an EPSG code. It might need to handle the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties.
- `epsgLookup`: This function looks up proj4 definitions. It might need to ensure that the retrieved definitions include the necessary properties.

#### `src/ol/proj/Projection.js`

```
src/ol/proj/Projection.js
class: Projection
```

- `Projection`: This class encapsulates projection information. It might need to ensure that the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties are correctly set when a projection is created.

#### `src/ol/proj/projections.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/ol/proj/transforms.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions and classes listed above are likely relevant to the issue described in the GitHub problem description. They may need to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that the `units` and `axisOrientation` properties are correctly set when using proj4js definitions with OpenLayers.
