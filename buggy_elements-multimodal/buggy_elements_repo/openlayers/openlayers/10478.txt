### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that white areas appear on the map when zooming in and out or panning around. This occurs because the underlying `Tile` objects have been disposed of and are excluded from the stitching process during reprojection, leading to incomplete map coverage.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the lifecycle management of `Tile` objects. When a tile is disposed of, it is no longer included in the stitching process for reprojection, resulting in white areas where the tile should be. This suggests that the disposal of tiles is happening prematurely or that the system is not correctly handling the state of tiles that should still be included in the reprojection process.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/reproj.js

```
src/ol/reproj.js
class: ReprojTile
function: function_3
```

- **ReprojTile**: This class manages the reprojection of a single tile from a source projection to a target projection. It is directly involved in the reprojection process and could be responsible for ensuring that tiles are correctly included or excluded based on their state.
- **function_3**: This function handles the rendering of reprojected data onto a canvas. It iterates over each triangle in the triangulation and applies transformations to map source coordinates to target pixel coordinates. It could be relevant if it is not correctly handling tiles that have been disposed of.

#### src/ol/Tile.js

```
src/ol/Tile.js
class: Tile
```

- **Tile**: This class manages the lifecycle of tiles, including their state. The issue might be related to how tiles are marked as disposed or how their state is managed during the reprojection process.

#### src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js
class: CanvasTileLayerRenderer
```

- **CanvasTileLayerRenderer**: This class manages the rendering of tile layers on a canvas. It handles tile loading, rendering, and management. It could be relevant if it is not correctly managing the state of tiles during the rendering process.

#### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js

```
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
class: ReprojTile
```

- **ReprojTile**: This class is already mentioned in `src/ol/reproj.js` and is directly involved in the reprojection process. It ensures that tiles are correctly included or excluded based on their state.

#### src/ol/source/TileImage.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

- This file contains classes and functions related to managing image tiles but does not directly handle the reprojection process or the lifecycle of tiles during reprojection.

#### src/ol/source/XYZ.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

- This file contains a class for handling XYZ tile sources but does not directly handle the reprojection process or the lifecycle of tiles during reprojection.

#### src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

- This file contains a class for managing tile grids but does not directly handle the reprojection process or the lifecycle of tiles during reprojection.
