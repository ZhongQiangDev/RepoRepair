### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `VectorSource.getExtent()` method returns `[Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]` when called inside the `featuresloadend` callback. This indicates that the extent is not being calculated correctly, likely because the features have not been properly added to the `VectorSource` before the extent is queried.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue appears to be the order of operations in the `loadFeaturesXhr` callback function. Specifically, the `success` callback is being called before the features are added to the `VectorSource` using `source.addFeatures(features)`. This means that when the `featuresloadend` event is triggered, the `VectorSource` does not yet contain the features, leading to an incorrect extent calculation.
