### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is the **splitting of rendering tests** across two different locations: `rendering` and `test/rendering`. This split leads to inconsistency and makes it harder to manage and maintain the tests.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to historical reasons or different development phases where tests were added to different directories without unifying them. This results in a fragmented testing structure, making it difficult to maintain and understand the test suite. Unifying the tests into a single method or directory would improve consistency and ease of maintenance.

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the issue of split rendering tests. The problem described is more about the organization and structure of the test files themselves rather than the functionality of the code within these specific files. To address the issue, you would need to:

1. Identify all the rendering tests currently located in `rendering` and `test/rendering`.
2. Move or copy these tests into a single, unified directory or file structure.
3. Update any references or imports in the codebase to point to the new unified location of the tests. 

This would ensure that all rendering tests are managed consistently and are easier to maintain.
