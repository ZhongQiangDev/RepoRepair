### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that when an empty extent (with `Infinity` values) is transformed using `applyTransform`, the resulting extent contains `NaN` values. This causes issues when the extent is used in subsequent operations, such as `map.getView().fit(extent)`, which throws an error.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is in the `fromEPSG4326` function, specifically in the line where the `y` value is calculated:
```javascript
let y = RADIUS * Math.log(Math.tan((Math.PI * (+input[i + 1] + 90)) / 360));
```
When the input extent contains `Infinity` values, the `Math.tan` function returns `NaN`, leading to the entire calculation resulting in `NaN`. This is because `Math.tan(Infinity)` is undefined and results in `NaN`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/extent.js`
```
src/ol/extent.js
function: applyTransform
```
The `applyTransform` function is directly involved in the issue because it applies the transformation function to the extent. If the transformation function returns `NaN` values, the resulting extent will also contain `NaN`.

#### `src/ol/proj.js`
```
src/ol/proj.js
function: getTransform
function: transform
```
The `getTransform` function retrieves the transformation function between two projections, and the `transform` function applies this transformation to a coordinate. These functions are indirectly involved because they are responsible for obtaining and applying the transformation function that ultimately causes the `NaN` values.

#### `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`
```
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
function: fromEPSG4326
```
The `fromEPSG4326` function is the direct cause of the issue. It calculates the `y` value using `Math.tan`, which results in `NaN` when the input is `Infinity`.

#### `src/ol/proj/Projection.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Projection` class does not directly contribute to the issue described.

#### `src/ol/proj/transforms.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file manage the cache of transformation functions but do not directly cause the `NaN` values.
