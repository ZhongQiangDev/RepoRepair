### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description highlights two main issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape and Size of Drawn Geometries with `useGeographic`**: When using the `useGeographic` option, drawn circles and other custom geometries do not maintain their expected shape and size. For example, a circle does not extend to the pointer position as it would in non-geographic mode, especially noticeable in higher latitudes.

2. **Irregular Shapes from `createRegularPolygon` and `createBox`**: 
   - `createRegularPolygon` produces shapes that are far from regular, as shown in the first image where the polygon appears distorted.
   - `createBox` cannot produce a box when the view projection is not parallel to WGS84, as shown in the second image where the box is not aligned correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues seem to stem from how coordinates are transformed and handled when `useGeographic` is enabled. When `useGeographic` is set, the user projection is set to EPSG:4326 (WGS84), which is a geographic coordinate system. This can cause problems when drawing shapes because:

- **Geographic Coordinates vs. Projected Coordinates**: Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) are not linear and do not maintain consistent distances and angles across the globe. When drawing shapes in a geographic coordinate system, the shapes may appear distorted, especially at higher latitudes.
- **Transformations and Projections**: The transformations between geographic and projected coordinates may not be correctly applied when drawing shapes, leading to irregular shapes and incorrect sizes.
