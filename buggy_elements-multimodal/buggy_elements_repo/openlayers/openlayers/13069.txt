### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values from the GeoTIFF metadata are not being used as default `max` and `min` values for normalization in the GeoTIFF source. Instead, the current implementation likely relies on hardcoded or user-defined `min` and `max` values for normalization.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the code responsible for handling GeoTIFF data and performing normalization does not check for the presence of `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` in the metadata and use them as defaults. This likely involves the part of the code that reads the GeoTIFF metadata and sets up the normalization parameters.

### Explanation

- **Class `GeoTIFFSource`**: This class is responsible for handling GeoTIFF data sources and likely contains the logic for normalization. It would be relevant to check if it uses `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` from the metadata.
- **Function `getImagesForSource`**: This function fetches GeoTIFF images and their overviews. It might be relevant if it processes metadata during image fetching.
- **Function `getImagesForTIFF`**: This function extracts images from a GeoTIFF object. It might be relevant if it processes metadata during image extraction.
- **Function `getBoundingBox`**: This function retrieves the bounding box of a GeoTIFF image. It might be relevant if it processes metadata that includes normalization values.
- **Function `getOrigin`**: This function retrieves the origin of a GeoTIFF image. It might be relevant if it processes metadata that includes normalization values.

These functions and the class should be inspected to ensure they correctly handle and utilize the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values from the GeoTIFF metadata for normalization.
