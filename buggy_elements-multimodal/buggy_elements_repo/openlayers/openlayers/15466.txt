### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the handling of image and label combinations when the `declutterMode` is set to something other than 'declutter'. Specifically, the issue is that when a layer's style function returns both imagery and text (e.g., point markers and labels), the current implementation does not allow for selective decluttering of only the text. The user requests an enhancement to allow for more granular control over decluttering, such as decluttering only text or only geometry.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the current implementation of the `declutterMode` option, which is a boolean value. This boolean value does not allow for specifying different decluttering modes for different types of features (e.g., text vs. geometry). To address this, the `declutterMode` option needs to be extended to support more granular control, such as specifying 'text', 'geometry', or 'both' for decluttering.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js`

This file contains relevant functions and classes that need to be inspected or edited:

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
function: getDeclutterBox
class: Executor
```

The `Executor` class is responsible for rendering instructions, including decluttering. The `getDeclutterBox` function is used to retrieve the decluttering bounding box, which is relevant to the decluttering process.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js`

This file contains relevant functions and classes that need to be inspected or edited:

```
src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
class: ExecutorGroup
```

The `ExecutorGroup` class manages a collection of executors and handles decluttering and overlapping geometries. It is relevant to the issue because it controls the rendering order and decluttering of features.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to hit detection and do not directly impact the decluttering of images and labels.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`

This file contains relevant functions and classes that need to be inspected or edited:

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
function: calculateScale
class: Icon
```

The `Icon` class manages the visual representation of vector features as icons and includes properties related to decluttering. The `calculateScale` function is relevant for scaling images, which can be part of the decluttering process.

#### `src/ol/style/Image.js`

This file contains relevant functions and classes that need to be inspected or edited:

```
src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
```

The `ImageStyle` class is an abstract base class for image-based symbols and includes properties and methods related to image rendering and decluttering. It is relevant to the issue because it provides the foundation for managing image styles.
