### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after drawing a polygon on the map using OpenLayers 5.3.0, the map becomes undraggable. This issue does not occur consistently but seems to be related to the `drawend` event. The user mentions that rolling back to OpenLayers 4.6.5 resolves the issue, indicating a potential bug in the newer version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `Draw` interaction handles the `drawend` event in OpenLayers 5.3.0. Specifically, there might be a problem with event listeners or the state of the map interactions after the drawing is completed. The `altKeyOnly` condition might also play a role if it affects how the drawing interaction is managed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `examples/draw-and-modify-features.js`

```
examples/draw-and-modify-features.js
function: addInteractions
function: function_2
```

These functions manage the drawing and snapping interactions. The `addInteractions` function sets up the drawing interaction, and `function_2` handles changes in the type of feature being drawn. Both could be relevant if there is an issue with how interactions are added or removed.

#### `examples/draw-features.js`

```
examples/draw-features.js
function: addInteraction
function: function_2
function: function_3
```

These functions are similar to those in `draw-and-modify-features.js` but focus on drawing features. The `addInteraction` function sets up the drawing interaction, `function_2` handles changes in the type of feature being drawn, and `function_3` provides an undo feature. These could be relevant if there is an issue with how drawing interactions are managed.

#### `src/ol/events.js`

```
src/ol/events.js
function: function_1
function: function_7
function: function_9
function: function_10
function: function_11
```

These functions manage event listeners and their binding/unbinding. Issues with event listeners could cause the map to become undraggable. Functions like `function_1` (binding listeners), `function_7` (listening to events), `function_9` (unlistening to events), `function_10` (unlistening by key), and `function_11` (finding listeners) could be relevant if there is a problem with how event listeners are managed during the drawing process.

#### `src/ol/interaction.js`

```
src/ol/interaction.js
function: defaults
function: function_1
```

These functions manage default interactions on the map. The `defaults` function sets up default interactions, and `function_1` customizes these interactions. These could be relevant if there is an issue with how default interactions are set up or modified during the drawing process.

#### `src/ol/MapBrowserPointerEvent.js`

```
src/ol/MapBrowserPointerEvent.js
class: MapBrowserPointerEvent
```

This class handles pointer events on the map. If there is an issue with how pointer events are handled during the drawing process, this class could be relevant.

#### `src/ol/events/condition.js`

```
src/ol/events/condition.js
function: function_1
```

This function checks if only the alt-key is pressed. Since the issue is related to the `altKeyOnly` condition, this function could be relevant if there is a problem with how the alt-key condition is checked.


### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after drawing a polygon using the `ol.interaction.Draw` interaction in OpenLayers 5.3.0, the map becomes unresponsive to dragging. This issue does not occur in OpenLayers 4.6.5, suggesting a regression in the newer version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to be related to the `ol.interaction.Draw` interaction and how it handles the `drawend` event. Specifically, it appears that the interaction might be interfering with the map's dragging functionality after the polygon is drawn. This could be due to event listeners not being properly removed or a state not being reset correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/interaction/DragBox.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes related to the `ol.interaction.Draw` interaction.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/ol/interaction/Draw.js`

This file contains the `Draw` class, which is directly related to the issue. The `Draw` class handles the drawing of geometries on the map and includes methods that manage the drawing process, such as `handleDownEvent`, `handleDragEvent`, and `handleUpEvent`. These methods are likely involved in the issue.

```
src/ol/interaction/Draw.js
class: Draw
```

#### `src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js`

This file contains the `PointerInteraction` class, which is a base class for interactions that handle pointer events. The `Draw` interaction extends this class, so it is indirectly related to the issue.

```
src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js
class: PointerInteraction
```

#### `src/ol/pointer/PointerEventHandler.js`

This file contains the `PointerEventHandler` class, which manages pointer events. While it is part of the event handling mechanism, it is not directly related to the `Draw` interaction's specific behavior.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
