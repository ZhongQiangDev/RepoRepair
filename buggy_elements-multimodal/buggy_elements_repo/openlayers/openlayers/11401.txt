### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described involves two main issues:
- **Hit Detection Failure**: When the icon scale is negative and the rotation is 0, the hit detection does not work as expected. This means that clicking on the icon does not register a hit.
- **Rendering Issue**: The icon is not rendered correctly at the edge of the map. Instead of being partially visible, it disappears entirely.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues likely stem from how transformations (scaling and rotation) are applied to the icon during rendering and how these transformations affect hit detection. Specifically:
- **Scaling**: Negative scaling might cause the icon to be mirrored, which could interfere with the hit detection logic that assumes positive scaling.
- **Clipping and Transformation**: The icon might not be clipped correctly at the map edge when scaled negatively, leading to it disappearing instead of being partially visible.
- **Hit Detection Logic**: The hit detection mechanism might not account for negative scaling, causing it to fail to register hits on the icon.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/render.js`

This file contains functions that handle rendering and transformations, which are directly related to the described issues.

```
src/ol/render.js
function: getRenderPixel
function: getVectorContext
function: renderDeclutterItems
function: toContext
```

- `getRenderPixel`: This function applies transformations to pixels, which could be relevant if the transformations are not correctly handling negative scales.
- `getVectorContext`: This function sets up the rendering context, including transformations, which could be relevant if the transformations are not correctly applied for negative scales.
- `renderDeclutterItems`: This function handles rendering of decluttered items, which could be relevant if the rendering logic does not handle negative scales correctly.
- `toContext`: This function initializes the canvas context, including scaling transformations, which could be relevant if the scaling is not correctly applied for negative scales.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js`

This file contains the `ExecutorGroup` class, which manages rendering and hit detection, and could be relevant to the issues.

```
src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
class: ExecutorGroup
```

- `ExecutorGroup`: This class manages clipping, rendering, and hit detection, which could be relevant if the clipping or hit detection logic does not handle negative scales correctly.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js`

This file contains functions specifically related to hit detection, which are directly relevant to the hit detection issue.

```
src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js
function: createHitDetectionImageData
function: hitDetect
```

- `createHitDetectionImageData`: This function creates the image data used for hit detection, which could be relevant if the image data is not correctly generated for negative scales.
- `hitDetect`: This function performs the actual hit detection, which could be relevant if the hit detection logic does not handle negative scales correctly.

#### `src/ol/renderer/Map.js`

This file contains functions and classes related to map rendering, but they do not seem directly relevant to the specific issues described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
