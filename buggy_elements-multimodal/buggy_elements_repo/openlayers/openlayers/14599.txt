### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the attributions from a visible sub-layer (2) within an invisible group layer (1) are still being displayed in the info popup (3), despite the group layer being set to invisible. This is unexpected because the attributions should not be displayed when the parent group layer is not visible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the visibility of layers is being propagated and checked when determining which attributions to display. Specifically, the `Attribution` control may not be correctly considering the visibility of the parent group layer when deciding whether to display the attributions of its sub-layers. This could be due to a flaw in how the `Attribution` control collects and filters attributions based on layer visibility.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/control/Attribution.js ---
This file contains the `Attribution` class, which is responsible for managing the display of attributions. The `collectSourceAttributions_` method is likely where the issue lies, as it collects the visible attributions from the map's layers. If this method does not correctly account for the visibility of group layers, it could lead to the described behavior.

```
src/ol/control/Attribution.js
class: Attribution
```

#### --- src/ol/layer/Base.js ---
This file contains the `BaseLayer` class, which provides foundational functionality for managing layer properties such as visibility. While this class is important for layer management, it does not directly handle the attribution display logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/ol/layer/Group.js ---
This file contains the `LayerGroup` class, which manages a collection of layers as a single unit. The `getLayers` and `setLayers` methods, along with the `handleLayersChanged_` method, are relevant as they manage the layers within the group. However, the issue seems more related to how the visibility of the group layer affects the attribution display rather than the group layer management itself.

```
src/ol/layer/Group.js
class: LayerGroup
```

#### --- src/ol/layer/Layer.js ---
This file contains the `Layer` class, which provides core functionality for managing layer visibility, source data, and rendering. The `isVisible()` method checks if a layer should be rendered based on view state and extent, which is relevant to determining layer visibility.

```
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
class: Layer
```

#### --- src/ol/renderer/Map.js ---
This file contains the `MapRenderer` class and other rendering-related functions. While rendering is important, the issue described is more related to layer visibility and attribution display rather than the rendering process itself.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
