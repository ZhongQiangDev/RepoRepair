### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `opacity` option in `ol/layer/Heatmap` is being ignored. When the `opacity` is set to a value like `0.1`, the heatmap layer does not visually reflect this change in opacity, indicating that the opacity setting is not being applied correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the `opacity` property is handled within the `Heatmap` layer and its rendering process. The `opacity` setting should be passed down to the WebGL rendering pipeline, affecting the final output. If the `opacity` is ignored, it suggests that either the property is not being correctly propagated to the WebGL renderer or the renderer is not applying the opacity correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/layer/BaseVector.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js

```
src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
class: Heatmap
```

The `Heatmap` class is directly related to the issue since it is the layer where the `opacity` option is supposed to be applied. The class should handle the `opacity` property and pass it to the WebGL renderer.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js
class: WebGLPointsLayerRenderer
```

The `WebGLPointsLayerRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the heatmap using WebGL. It should apply the `opacity` setting during the rendering process. The shaders and uniforms used in this class might need to be adjusted to correctly handle the `opacity` property.

#### src/ol/webgl/Helper.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass.js

```
src/ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass.js
class: WebGLPostProcessingPass
```

The `WebGLPostProcessingPass` class might be relevant if post-processing is involved in applying the `opacity`. If the heatmap layer uses post-processing effects, the `opacity` might need to be applied during these passes.
