### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves a mismatch between the layer and the map when using the `ImageArcGISRest` source in OpenLayers 7.4. Specifically:

- **Layer-Map Mismatch**: When the `ratio` parameter is set to a value other than 1 or 1.5, the layer does not align correctly with the map.
- **Layer-Map Mismatch after Map Rotation**: Even with the `ratio` set to 1.5 or other values, the layer does not align correctly with the map after the map is rotated.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the default value of the `ratio` parameter in the `ImageArcGISRest` class. The default value of `1.5` may not be appropriate for all scenarios, especially when the computer's zoom or scaling ratio is not 100%. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the image extent, causing the layer to misalign with the map. Additionally, the issue with map rotation suggests that the transformation or scaling logic may not be correctly handling the `ratio` parameter during rotation operations.

### Explanation

The `ImageArcGISRest` class is directly related to the issue described in the GitHub problem. The `ratio_` attribute and its default value of `1.5` are likely the root cause of the layer-map mismatch. The class manages the image loading and rendering process, and any issues with the `ratio` parameter would manifest in the behavior of this class. Therefore, the `ImageArcGISRest` class is the primary location that needs inspection and potential editing to fix the problem.
