### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `indent` rule incorrectly flagging indentation errors in JSX binary expressions when parentheses are used. Specifically, the rule expects a certain level of indentation but finds a different level, leading to false positives. The issue is that the code snippet with parentheses is flagged for incorrect indentation, while the same code without parentheses is not.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the `indent` rule handles the indentation of JSX expressions within parentheses. The rule may not be correctly accounting for the additional nesting level introduced by the parentheses, leading it to expect a different indentation level than what is actually present. This could be due to a regression in how the rule calculates the expected indentation for nested JSX expressions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/rules/indent-legacy.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/rules/indent.js`

```
lib/rules/indent.js
function: create
```

The `create` function in `lib/rules/indent.js` is responsible for implementing the `indent` rule. Given the problem description, the issue likely lies within this function, particularly in how it handles indentation for JSX expressions within parentheses. The function may need to be adjusted to correctly account for the additional nesting level introduced by the parentheses.

#### `lib/rules/jsx-quotes.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/rules/no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/rules/space-before-blocks.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary

The relevant file and function that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:
