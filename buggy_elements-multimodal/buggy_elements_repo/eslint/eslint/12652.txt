### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `key-spacing` rule with the `align: 'value'` option is causing object literals within JSX expressions to be formatted in an undesirable way. Specifically, it is aligning the values of object properties in a way that makes the code less readable and visually unappealing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to how the `key-spacing` rule handles alignment when applied to object literals within JSX expressions. The rule is designed to align values based on their positions, but it does not take into account the context of JSX, leading to formatting that is not ideal for these specific cases.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/rules/key-spacing.js`

This file contains the `key-spacing` rule, which is directly related to the issue described. The following functions and classes are relevant:

```
lib/rules/key-spacing.js
function: create
function: initOptions
function: isSingleLine
```

- `create`: This function is responsible for creating the rule and handling the logic for checking and enforcing spacing around colons in object literals. It needs to be examined to see if it can be modified to handle JSX contexts better.
- `initOptions`: This function initializes the options for the rule, including the alignment settings. It may need to be adjusted to provide more flexibility for JSX-specific configurations.
- `isSingleLine`: This function checks if a node is contained within a single line. It might be relevant for determining how to handle multi-line JSX expressions.

#### `lib/rules/object-curly-spacing.js`

This file contains the `object-curly-spacing` rule, which is related to spacing inside curly braces. While it is not directly causing the issue, it might interact with the `key-spacing` rule in certain cases. However, based on the problem description, it does not seem to be the primary cause.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/rules/object-property-newline.js`

This file contains the `object-property-newline` rule, which enforces new lines for object properties. It is not directly related to the alignment issue described in the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The primary file that needs inspection and potential editing is `lib/rules/key-spacing.js`, specifically the `create`, `initOptions`, and `isSingleLine` functions. These functions should be examined to determine how they can be modified to handle JSX contexts more appropriately and prevent the undesirable formatting of object literals within JSX expressions.
