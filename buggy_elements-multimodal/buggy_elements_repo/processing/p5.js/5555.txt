### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using WebGL mode in p5.js, the alpha blending of a semi-transparent red square on a black background results in the red square blending with the blue background of the page instead of the black background of the canvas. This is unexpected and inconsistent with the behavior in 2D mode, where the red square blends correctly with the black background.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely related to the default WebGL context settings, specifically the `alpha` attribute. When `alpha` is set to `true` in the WebGL context, the canvas can have a transparent background, which allows the page's background color to show through. This results in the red square blending with the blue background of the page instead of the black background of the canvas. Setting `alpha` to `false` would prevent this behavior by making the canvas background opaque.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/core/p5.Renderer.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/core/rendering.js`
```
src/core/rendering.js
function: function_1
```
The `createCanvas` function is relevant because it initializes the WebGL context and sets the `alpha` attribute. This function is where the default value of `alpha` should be changed.

#### `src/webgl/material.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`
```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
function: function_2
```
The `_setAttributeDefaults` function is relevant because it sets default WebGL attributes, including `alpha`. This function should be updated to set `alpha` to `false` by default.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
