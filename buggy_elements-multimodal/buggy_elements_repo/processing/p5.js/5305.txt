### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description outlines an enhancement to the `fesErrorMonitor` function in the p5.js library. The goal is to add more error messages for various JavaScript errors (e.g., SyntaxError, TypeError, ReferenceError) that the browser might show. The enhancement aims to provide more user-friendly error messages to help users understand and fix their code more easily.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current behavior of `fesErrorMonitor` is limited to a predefined set of errors. The enhancement aims to expand this list to include additional error types and provide more detailed, user-friendly error messages. The cause of the "wrong behavior" is that the existing error messages are not comprehensive enough to cover all common JavaScript errors that users might encounter.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/core/friendly_errors/fes_core.js`

This file contains several functions that are relevant to the enhancement:

```
src/core/friendly_errors/fes_core.js
function: function_21
function: function_22
function: function_27
function: function_29
function: function_2
```

- `function_21` (`fesErrorMonitor`): This function is responsible for monitoring and handling global errors. It needs to be updated to include the new error types and friendly messages.
- `function_22` (`defineMisusedAtTopLevelCode`): This function gathers symbols from `p5.prototype` and constants to help identify misused symbols. It may need to be updated if new symbols are added.
- `function_27` (`helpForMisusedAtTopLevelCode`): This function handles errors related to misused symbols at the top level. It may need to be updated if new symbols are added.
- `function_29`: This function removes an event listener after the window's 'load' event. It may need to be updated if the event handling logic changes.
- `function_2`: This function (`getType`) determines the type of an object. It may be relevant if new error types require type checking.

#### `src/core/friendly_errors/file_errors.js`

This file contains functions related to file loading errors. It is not directly relevant to the enhancement of adding more error messages for JavaScript errors:
