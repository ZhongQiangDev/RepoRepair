### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` function does not produce the expected result when used in WebGL mode. In the 2D mode, the overlapping area of the red and blue circles is black, which is the expected result of the `MULTIPLY` blend mode. However, in WebGL mode, the overlapping area remains white, indicating that the `MULTIPLY` blend mode is not functioning as intended.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `blendMode` function is implemented for WebGL rendering. In WebGL, blending is controlled using the `blendEquation` and `blendFunc` functions, which may not be correctly configured for the `MULTIPLY` blend mode. The 2D rendering context uses a different mechanism for blending, which is why it works as expected in that mode.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`
```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
function: function_14
function: function_17
function: function_18
function: function_46
function: function_47
```

- `function_14`: This function handles the `blendMode` for WebGL and sets the current blend mode. It may need to be adjusted to correctly handle the `MULTIPLY` blend mode.
- `function_17`: This function applies the current blend mode in WebGL. It may need to be modified to correctly implement the `MULTIPLY` blend mode.
- `function_18`: This function manages WebGL blending and depth masking. It may need to be adjusted to ensure proper blending behavior.
- `function_46`: This function manages shaders for strokes in WebGL. It may need to be checked to ensure it does not interfere with the blend mode.
- `function_47`: This function determines the fill shader for immediate rendering. It may need to be checked to ensure it does not interfere with the blend mode.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js` (continued)
This file contains no other relevant functions/classes.

### Summary
The issue is likely related to the implementation of the `blendMode` function in WebGL mode. The relevant functions are located in `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`. These functions need to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure the `MULTIPLY` blend mode works correctly in WebGL.
