### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `loadStrings()` function in p5.js filters out empty lines when loading a text file, whereas the equivalent function in Processing includes empty lines in the resulting array. This discrepancy causes issues when trying to match line numbers in shader files loaded by `loadShader()` with their actual positions in the source file.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely within the implementation of the `loadStrings()` function in p5.js. Specifically, the function may be filtering out empty lines during the processing of the text file, which is not the desired behavior when trying to preserve line numbers for debugging purposes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/addons/p5.dom.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/p5.Renderer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/io/files.js ---
```
src/io/files.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
```

**Explanation:**
- `function_3` and `function_4` are both implementations of `loadStrings()`. These functions are responsible for loading a text file and splitting its contents into an array of strings, each representing a line from the file. The issue described in the GitHub problem description is likely related to how these functions handle empty lines.

#### --- src/webgl/loading.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/webgl/material.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Functions

The relevant functions are:
```
src/io/files.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
```

These functions need to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that empty lines are not filtered out when loading text files.
