### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors identified in the GitHub problem description are:

- **Incorrect Near and Far Values for `ortho()` and `frustum()`**: When setting the near and far values using `ortho()` or `frustum()`, the camera's `cameraNear` and `cameraFar` properties do not reflect the values passed to these functions. Instead, they show default values.
- **Incorrect Default Behavior of `frustum()`**: When `frustum()` is called without arguments, it behaves more like `perspective()` rather than `ortho()`, causing objects to disappear.
- **Incorrect Matrix Component Calculation**: The vertical direction is reversed when the 3rd and 4th arguments of `ortho()` and `frustum()` are reversed, indicating an issue with the matrix component calculation.
- **Vertical Rotation Direction Reversal**: The vertical rotation direction is reversed, which is caused by the determinant of the projection matrix being negative.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

- **Incorrect Near and Far Values**: The issue likely stems from how the `ortho()` and `frustum()` functions update the camera's `cameraNear` and `cameraFar` properties. These properties might not be updated correctly when the projection matrix is set.
- **Incorrect Default Behavior of `frustum()`**: The default behavior of `frustum()` might be incorrectly set to resemble `perspective()` instead of `ortho()`. This could be due to incorrect default values or logic in the function.
- **Incorrect Matrix Component Calculation**: The matrix component calculation might not account for the sign change when the 3rd and 4th arguments are reversed, leading to the vertical direction being reversed.
- **Vertical Rotation Direction Reversal**: The determinant of the projection matrix being negative could indicate an issue with the matrix inversion or the way the matrix is being applied to the camera.
