### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the double hyphen flag (`--flag`) is not being highlighted correctly in PowerShell syntax highlighting. Specifically, the `--flag` is not being recognized and highlighted as it should be, while the single hyphen flag (`-flag`) is highlighted correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for PowerShell in the Highlight.js library. The rules for identifying and highlighting flags in PowerShell may not be correctly configured to recognize double hyphen flags (`--flag`). This could be due to missing or incorrect regular expressions in the syntax highlighting configuration for PowerShell.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `src/languages/powershell.js`

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for PowerShell. Based on the description of the `function_1` function, it is responsible for defining the patterns and rules used to identify and highlight different elements of PowerShell code, including flags.

To fix the issue with double hyphen flags, we need to ensure that the syntax highlighting rules include a pattern to match double hyphen flags and assign them the appropriate CSS class for highlighting.

````
src/languages/powershell.js
function: function_1
````

The `function_1` function is the relevant function that needs to be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue with double hyphen flags. Specifically, the patterns and rules defined within this function need to be examined to ensure they correctly handle double hyphen flags.

### Summary

The `function_1` function in `src/languages/powershell.js` is the relevant function that needs to be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue with double hyphen flags not being highlighted correctly in PowerShell syntax highlighting.
