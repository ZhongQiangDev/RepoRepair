### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in Verilog code, the text following a backquote (`` ` ``) is incorrectly treated as `meta` scope until the end of the line. This causes comments following `` `define`` and other backquoted text to not be highlighted correctly. Additionally, when using defined values with a backquote (e.g., `` `CONSTANT``), the text following the backquote is also incorrectly highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the `meta` class is defined and applied in the Verilog language configuration. The `meta` class is used for preprocessor directives, but it seems to be incorrectly capturing everything from the backquote to the end of the line, including comments and other text that should not be part of the `meta` scope.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/languages/verilog.js ---
```
src/languages/verilog.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `verilog.js` is responsible for configuring the syntax highlighting for Verilog. The issue likely lies in the `contains` array where the `meta` class is defined. The current configuration may be too broad, capturing everything after a backquote until the end of the line.

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/languages/verilog.js
function: function_1
```

### Explanation

The `function_1` in `verilog.js` is where the Verilog language configuration is defined. The `contains` array within this function includes a `meta` class for preprocessor directives. The issue likely stems from how this `meta` class is defined, as it seems to be capturing more than it should. Adjusting the regular expression or logic used to define the `meta` class should resolve the incorrect highlighting issue.
