### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that multi-line comments in CMake, which are denoted by `#[[` and `]]`, are not being properly recognized and highlighted by `highlight.js`. Instead, they are being treated as single-line comments that start with `#`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the fact that the CMake language configuration in `highlight.js` does not include a specific rule for multi-line comments that start with `#[[` and end with `]]`. The current configuration only includes a rule for single-line comments that start with `#` (`hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE`).

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/cmake.js`

This file contains the configuration for the CMake language in `highlight.js`. The `function_1` in this file defines how CMake code should be highlighted. The `contains` array in the returned object specifies the different parts of the CMake code that should be highlighted. Currently, it includes a rule for single-line comments (`hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE`), but it does not include a rule for multi-line comments.

```
src/languages/cmake.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/lib/modes.js`

This file contains utility functions for creating different modes for syntax highlighting. The `function_3` in this file, named `COMMENT`, is used to create a comment mode for syntax highlighting. This function could be relevant if we need to create a new comment mode for the multi-line comments in CMake.

```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```

The other functions in `src/lib/modes.js` (`function_1` and `function_4`) do not seem directly relevant to the issue at hand.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
