### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that **highlight.js** does not provide adequate support for Python Type Hints as specified in PEP 484. The current implementation of Python syntax highlighting in **highlight.js** fails to properly recognize and highlight type hints, such as `Dict[int, Any]` or `List[float]`, which are essential for modern Python codebases. This results in a suboptimal syntax highlighting experience compared to other syntax highlighters like **Magic Python**.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the lack of specific rules or patterns in the **highlight.js** Python language definition that recognize and handle Python Type Hints. The current implementation may only highlight basic Python syntax elements like keywords, strings, numbers, and function definitions, but it does not include rules for recognizing and highlighting type hints.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/c-like.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is for C++ syntax highlighting and is not relevant to Python.

#### `src/languages/dart.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is for Dart syntax highlighting and is not relevant to Python.

#### `src/languages/python-repl.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is for Python REPL interactions and does not handle type hints.

#### `src/languages/python.js`
```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains the Python syntax highlighting configuration. The `function_1` function defines the rules for highlighting Python code. To fix the issue, we need to add or modify rules within this function to properly recognize and highlight Python Type Hints.

#### `src/languages/typescript.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is for TypeScript syntax highlighting and is not relevant to Python.

### Summary

The relevant file and function that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function in `src/languages/python.js` needs to be updated to include rules for recognizing and highlighting Python Type Hints. This may involve adding new patterns and regular expressions to the `contains` array within the function.
