### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the number `0` and numbers starting with `0` (like `0123`) are not being highlighted as numbers in Elixir syntax highlighting. Additionally, in floating-point numbers like `0.3`, only the digits after the decimal point (`3`) are highlighted as numbers, while the `0.` part is not.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the regular expression used to match numbers in the Elixir syntax highlighting configuration. The current regular expression may not be correctly identifying numbers that start with `0` or the `0.` part of floating-point numbers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/languages/elixir.js`

```
src/languages/elixir.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `src/languages/elixir.js` defines the syntax highlighting configuration for Elixir. The issue is likely related to the `NUMBER` pattern defined within this function. The regular expression used to match numbers may need to be adjusted to correctly identify numbers starting with `0` and the `0.` part of floating-point numbers.

#### `src/lib/regex.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
