### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the CSS syntax highlighting incorrectly highlights the closing parenthesis `)` within a string as if it were the end of the function call. This causes the rest of the string after the parenthesis to be incorrectly highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the CSS syntax highlighting rules in `highlight.js` do not properly handle parentheses within quoted strings. Specifically, the highlighting logic is prematurely ending the string when it encounters a closing parenthesis, even if it is inside a quoted string.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains the core initialization and configuration module for the `highlight.js` library. While it contains the main `highlight()` function and other core functionalities, it does not directly define the language-specific highlighting rules for CSS. Therefore, it is unlikely that the issue lies here.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/css.js`

This file contains the CSS-specific syntax highlighting configuration. The issue is likely related to how strings and parentheses are handled within the CSS grammar rules.

```
src/languages/css.js
function: function_1
```

### Detailed Analysis of `src/languages/css.js`

The `function_1` in `src/languages/css.js` defines the CSS language configuration. The issue is likely related to the string handling rules within the `contains` array. Specifically, the `QUOTE_STRING_MODE` or similar string modes may not be correctly handling parentheses within the string.

To fix this, you would need to ensure that the string modes correctly handle all characters within the quotes, including parentheses. This might involve adjusting the regular expressions used to define the string modes or adding additional logic to handle special cases.
