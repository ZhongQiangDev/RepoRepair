### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that some C++ code cannot be rendered correctly. Specifically, the code involving Eigen library operations is not being highlighted properly, as shown in the images provided. The expected behavior is that the C++ code should be highlighted correctly, similar to the second image provided.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue could be related to the following factors:
- **Language Definition**: The C++ language definition in `highlight.js` might not be correctly configured to handle the Eigen library syntax.
- **Highlighting Function**: The `highlight` function in `highlight.js` might not be correctly identifying or applying the C++ language rules.
- **DOM Integration**: The `highlightElement` or `highlightAll` functions might not be correctly applying the highlighting to the DOM elements containing the C++ code.
- **Language Registration**: The C++ language might not be correctly registered or configured in the `highlight.js` library.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- demo/demo.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
```
src/highlight.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- src/languages/c.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/cpp.js ---
```
src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the following locations need inspection or editing to fix the problem:

```
src/highlight.js
function: function_1

src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```

These functions are relevant because they are responsible for configuring and applying the C++ language definition and highlighting logic in the `highlight.js` library. Inspecting and potentially modifying these functions could resolve the issue with the C++ code rendering.
