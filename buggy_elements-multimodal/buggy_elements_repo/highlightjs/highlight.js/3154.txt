### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that heredocs without interpolation in Ruby are not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, the content within the heredoc without interpolation is not being recognized as a string, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for Ruby in the `src/languages/ruby.js` file. The rules for recognizing and highlighting heredocs without interpolation may not be correctly configured. This could be due to missing or incorrect regular expressions, or the absence of a specific mode to handle heredocs without interpolation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/ruby.js`

This file contains the syntax highlighting rules for Ruby, which is directly relevant to the issue. The function `function_1` in this file sets up the syntax patterns for various Ruby elements, including strings and heredocs. Therefore, this function is relevant to the problem.

```
src/languages/ruby.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/lib/modes.js`

This file contains utility functions for creating syntax highlighting modes, such as `COMMENT` and `END_SAME_AS_BEGIN`. While these functions are useful for defining modes, they do not directly handle the specific case of heredocs without interpolation. Therefore, this file does not contain directly relevant functions for this issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/lib/utils.js`

This file contains utility functions like `escapeHTML`, `inherit`, `mergeStreams`, `nodeStream`, and `tag`. These functions are general utilities and do not directly relate to the syntax highlighting of heredocs in Ruby. Therefore, this file does not contain relevant functions for this issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The only relevant file and function identified are:

```
src/languages/ruby.js
function: function_1
```

This function should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue with highlighting heredocs without interpolation in Ruby.
