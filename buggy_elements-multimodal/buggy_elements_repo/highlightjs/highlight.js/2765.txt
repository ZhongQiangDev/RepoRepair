### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect syntax highlighting of Handlebars templates, particularly with block `if` and `else` statements. The issue is that values and keywords are not being highlighted distinctly or consistently, as shown in the provided image. The expected behavior is for values and keywords to be highlighted distinctly and consistently, similar to how GitHub highlights the same code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior likely lies in the syntax highlighting configuration for Handlebars templates. The current configuration may not properly recognize and differentiate between keywords, values, and other elements within the Handlebars syntax, especially for block `if` and `else` statements. This could be due to insufficient or incorrect regular expressions and modes defined for these elements.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains the core initialization and extension point for the highlight.js library. While it provides the overall framework for syntax highlighting, the specific issue with Handlebars syntax highlighting is likely not due to a problem in this file. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/handlebars.js`

This file defines the syntax highlighting configuration for Handlebars templates. The issue is likely related to the regular expressions and modes defined for Handlebars syntax. The following functions or classes may be relevant:

```
src/languages/handlebars.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/languages/xml.js`

This file defines the syntax highlighting configuration for various markup languages, including XML and HTML. Since the issue is specific to Handlebars templates, this file is not relevant to the problem:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/languages/handlebars.js
