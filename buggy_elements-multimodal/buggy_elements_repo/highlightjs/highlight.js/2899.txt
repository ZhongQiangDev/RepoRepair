### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that an empty block comment (`/**/`) in Dart code breaks the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code. Specifically, the code following the empty block comment is not highlighted correctly, as seen in the provided images. The expected behavior is that the code should be highlighted properly even when an empty block comment is present.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the Dart language definition in `highlight.js` handles block comments. When an empty block comment is encountered, the parser may not correctly identify the end of the comment, leading to the rest of the code being treated as part of the comment. This could be due to a flaw in the regular expressions or logic used to define the comment boundaries.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of the `highlight.js` library. While it provides the overall framework for syntax highlighting, the specific issue with Dart's block comments is likely not caused by a problem in this file. The core highlighting functions (`highlight`, `highlightAuto`, etc.) are generic and rely on language-specific definitions.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/dart.js ---
This file contains the Dart language definition, which includes the rules for recognizing different elements of Dart syntax, including comments. The issue is likely related to how block comments are defined in this file.

```
src/languages/dart.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
This file contains utility functions for creating different modes, including comments. The `COMMENT` function is particularly relevant as it defines how comments are handled in syntax highlighting.

```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```
