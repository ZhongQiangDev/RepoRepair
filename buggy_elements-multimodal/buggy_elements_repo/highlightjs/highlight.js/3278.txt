### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that generic types using the `extends` keyword in TypeScript break subsequent syntax highlighting in versions 10.3.0 and later of Highlight.js. Specifically, the highlighting of TypeScript code with generics and type parameters is not correctly rendered, leading to improper syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from changes made between versions 10.2.1 and 10.3.0 of Highlight.js. The commit mentioned in the GitHub problem description (`f5e24b9413265fe76ff24244e2642f47d722a8e4`) is likely related to the problem, as it involves modifications to TypeScript syntax highlighting rules. The changes in this commit may have inadvertently affected how generics and type parameters are recognized and highlighted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
This file contains the core initialization and configuration module for Highlight.js. While it sets up the overall framework for syntax highlighting, it does not directly define language-specific rules. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the direct cause of the issue with TypeScript generics.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/typescript.js ---
This file defines the TypeScript-specific syntax highlighting rules. The issue is likely related to how generics and type parameters are handled in this file. The function `function_1` is responsible for extending the JavaScript syntax highlighting rules to support TypeScript-specific features.

```
src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
This file contains type definitions for Highlight.js. While it defines types used in the library, it does not directly affect the behavior of syntax highlighting. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the cause of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the most relevant location to inspect or edit to fix the problem is:

```
src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```

This function is responsible for defining the TypeScript-specific syntax highlighting rules and should be examined to ensure that generics and type parameters are correctly handled.
