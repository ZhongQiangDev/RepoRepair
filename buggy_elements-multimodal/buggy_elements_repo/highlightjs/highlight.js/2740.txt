### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `highlight.js` library incorrectly highlighting SQL code, particularly when it encounters string escape sequences. The issue is evident in the provided T-SQL code snippet where the highlighting breaks after a string escape sequence.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to how `highlight.js` handles string escape sequences in SQL code. Specifically, the library may not be correctly recognizing or processing the escape sequences within the SQL string literals, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains the core functionality of the `highlight.js` library. While it provides the overall structure and APIs for syntax highlighting, it does not directly handle language-specific highlighting rules. Therefore, it is unlikely that the issue lies here.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/sql.js`

This file is responsible for configuring the syntax highlighting rules for SQL code. The issue is likely related to how string modes are defined and processed in this file.

```
src/languages/sql.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/lib/modes.js`

This file contains utility functions for defining various modes, such as comments and shebang lines. While these modes are important for syntax highlighting, they are not directly related to the issue of string escape sequences in SQL.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the relevant location that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is:

```
src/languages/sql.js
function: function_1
```

This function defines the SQL language configuration, including string modes, and is likely where the issue with string escape sequences needs to be addressed.
