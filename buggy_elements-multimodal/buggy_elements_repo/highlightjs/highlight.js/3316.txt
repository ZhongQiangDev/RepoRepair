### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the syntax highlighting of primitive types in C++ code. After the changes made in hljs 11.0.0, primitive types like `int`, `char`, `unsigned long long`, and `signed int` are no longer highlighted as keywords. This results in a less natural and confusing appearance of the code compared to the previous version, where these primitive types were highlighted as keywords.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the change made in commit 1be7a28, where primitive types were moved from `RESERVED_TYPES` to `RESERVED_KEYWORDS` in the C++ language definition. This change separated the highlighting of primitive types from other keywords, leading to the observed highlighting differences.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/arduino.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/languages/c.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/languages/cpp.js`
```
src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```
The function `function_1` in `cpp.js` is relevant because it defines the C++ language syntax highlighting rules. The issue described is related to how primitive types are highlighted in C++ code, and this function is responsible for configuring the language definition.

#### `src/languages/typescript.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
