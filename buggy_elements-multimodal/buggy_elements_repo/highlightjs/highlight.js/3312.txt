### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `switch` statement is not highlighted correctly in C++ code when using Highlight.js version 10.7.0 and later. Specifically, the `switch` keyword is not highlighted in the same way as other control flow keywords like `if`, `while`, and `for`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in the syntax highlighting rules for C++ between versions 10.6.0 and 10.7.0 of Highlight.js. The `switch` statement should be recognized and highlighted as a control flow keyword, similar to `if`, `while`, and `for`. The problem may be due to a modification in the language definition for C++ that inadvertently excluded or altered the highlighting rules for the `switch` keyword.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/c.js`

This file contains the language definition for the C programming language. Since the issue is specific to C++, this file is not directly relevant to the problem. However, it is worth noting that C++ shares many syntax features with C, so any changes in the base C-like language definition could indirectly affect C++.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/cpp.js`

This file contains the language definition for the C++ programming language. The function `function_1` in this file is responsible for configuring the syntax highlighting rules for C++. The issue likely lies within this function, as it defines how C++ keywords, including `switch`, are recognized and highlighted.

```
src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```

### Conclusion

The relevant function that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is `function_1` in `src/languages/cpp.js`. This function is responsible for configuring the syntax highlighting rules for C++, and any changes or bugs in this function could lead to the incorrect highlighting of the `switch` statement. Other potentially related functions or classes would be those that define the base C-like language definition, but they are not directly mentioned in the provided files.
