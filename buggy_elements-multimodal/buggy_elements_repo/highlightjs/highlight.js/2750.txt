### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the syntax highlighter incorrectly interpreting the right curly brace (`}`) inside a template literal expression as the end of the expression. This causes the rest of the expression to be highlighted as a string, rather than as part of the expression. This issue is particularly noticeable when the expression includes nested template literals or functions.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the syntax highlighter handles template literals and their expressions. Specifically, the highlighter may not be correctly parsing nested curly braces within template literals, leading it to prematurely end the expression when it encounters a `}` that is part of a nested structure.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/javascript.js`

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript, including template literals. The `TEMPLATE_STRING` definition and the `SUBST` definition are likely relevant to the issue.

```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/languages/typescript.js`

This file extends the JavaScript syntax highlighting rules to support TypeScript. Since the issue is present in both JavaScript and TypeScript, this file may also be relevant if it modifies the template literal handling.

```
src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/lib/modes.js`

This file contains utility functions for creating syntax highlighting rules. While it includes functions for comments and shebang lines, it does not directly handle template literals. Therefore, it is less likely to be directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1

src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue with the syntax highlighter prematurely ending template literal expressions when encountering nested curly braces.
