### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a comment is placed on the same line as a decorator in Python code, the entire line is incorrectly highlighted with the `hljs-meta` class instead of properly distinguishing the decorator and the comment. Specifically, the comment section (`#` onwards) should be highlighted with the `hljs-comment` class.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the syntax highlighting rules not correctly identifying the comment when it is on the same line as a decorator. The current rules may be treating the entire line as metadata (`hljs-meta`) due to the presence of the decorator, failing to recognize the comment separately.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/python-repl.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue described is related to Python syntax highlighting in general code, not specifically in a REPL environment.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/python.js`

This file contains the main Python syntax highlighting configuration. The function `function_1` defines the rules for highlighting Python code, including decorators and comments. The issue likely lies here.

```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/lib/modes.js`

This file contains utility functions for creating syntax highlighting modes. The `COMMENT` function (`function_3`) is responsible for creating comment modes, which may be relevant to the issue.

```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```
