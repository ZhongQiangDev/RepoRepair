### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `LL` suffix is used in C/C++ integer literals, only the first `L` is highlighted, while the second `L` is not. The expected behavior is that both `L`s should be highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the regular expression or pattern used to match integer literals with the `LL` suffix in the syntax highlighting configuration. The pattern may be incorrectly set up to only match the first `L` and not the second one.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/c-like.js`

This file contains the base language definition for C-like languages, including C and C++. The `NUMBERS` object within this file likely contains the pattern for matching integer literals, including the `LL` suffix.

````
src/languages/c-like.js
function: function_1
````

#### `src/languages/c.js`

This file configures syntax highlighting specifically for the C programming language. It relies on the base definition from `c-like.js` and does not define any specific patterns for integer literals.

````
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
````

#### `src/languages/cpp.js`

This file configures syntax highlighting specifically for the C++ programming language. Similar to `c.js`, it relies on the base definition from `c-like.js` and does not define any specific patterns for integer literals.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The relevant location for inspection or editing is:

````
src/languages/c-like.js
function: function_1
````

This function contains the base language definition for C-like languages, including the `NUMBERS` object that defines the pattern for matching integer literals. The pattern for the `LL` suffix should be reviewed and corrected to ensure both `L`s are highlighted.
