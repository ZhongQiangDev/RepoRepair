### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that inline comments within CSS properties are not highlighted correctly when using the `highlightAll` function in version 10.6.0 and later. Specifically, the inline comment `/* inline comment */` within the `width` property is not highlighted as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from changes in the `highlightAll` function or related CSS highlighting rules between versions 10.5.0 and 10.6.0. The `highlightAll` function may not be correctly identifying or handling inline comments within CSS properties, leading to improper highlighting.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/highlight.js`
```
src/highlight.js
function: highlightAll
```
The `highlightAll` function is directly responsible for highlighting all `<pre><code>` blocks on the page. If there is an issue with inline comment highlighting, it may be related to how `highlightAll` processes CSS code.

#### `src/languages/css.js`
```
src/languages/css.js
function: function_1
```
This function defines the CSS syntax highlighting configuration. It includes rules for handling various parts of CSS, including comments. If inline comments are not being highlighted correctly, the issue may lie in how this function defines comment highlighting.

#### `src/languages/lib/css-shared.js`
```
src/languages/lib/css-shared.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains shared CSS modes, including the `C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE` which is used for highlighting block comments. If inline comments are not being handled correctly, this function may need to be examined to ensure it properly handles inline comments.

#### `src/lib/modes.js`
```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```
The `COMMENT` function in this file creates a comment mode for syntax highlighting. If inline comments are not being highlighted correctly, this function may need to be examined to ensure it properly handles inline comments.

#### `types/index.d.ts`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not directly affect the highlighting behavior. Therefore, it is not relevant to the issue at hand.
