### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Python identifier `_undef` is incorrectly highlighted as if it were the keyword `def`. Specifically, the substring `def` within `_undef` is being highlighted as a Python keyword, which is not the intended behavior. This issue occurs in version 11.0.0 and later, but not in version 10.7.3.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the regular expression patterns used for identifying Python keywords in the `highlight.js` library. The pattern for matching keywords might be too broad, causing it to match substrings within identifiers instead of only complete words. This could be due to a lack of word boundary checks (`\b`) in the regular expression that defines Python keywords.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/languages/python.js`

```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `python.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Python. The issue likely stems from how keywords are defined and matched within this function. Specifically, the regular expression used to match Python keywords might not be correctly handling word boundaries, causing it to match `def` within `_undef`.

#### `src/languages/vbscript-html.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/lib/html_injection_error.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/lib/html_renderer.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/lib/regex.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `python.js` is the most relevant function to inspect and potentially edit to fix the issue. The regular expression patterns used for matching Python keywords should be reviewed to ensure they correctly handle word boundaries and do not match substrings within identifiers.
