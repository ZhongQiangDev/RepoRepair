### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `language-php` class is added to a `<code>` element, an extra `php` tag is added to the highlighted code. This results in incorrect HTML output, where the PHP code is wrapped in an additional `<php>` tag, which is not expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to be related to how the `highlight.js` library processes the `language-php` class. Specifically, it appears that the library is incorrectly interpreting the `language-php` class and adding an extra `php` tag to the highlighted code. This could be due to a problem in the PHP language definition or in the core highlighting logic of the library.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
This file contains the core initialization and configuration module for the `highlight.js` library. The functions and classes in this file are responsible for setting up internal data structures, defining utility functions, and exposing public methods for syntax highlighting. The `highlightAll()` function, which is used to automatically highlight all `<pre><code>` blocks on the page, could be relevant to this issue.

```
src/highlight.js
function: highlightAll
```

#### --- src/languages/javascript.js ---
This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript and its variants. Since the issue is related to PHP, this file is not directly relevant to the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/lib/utils.js ---
This file contains utility functions that are used throughout the library. The `escapeHTML` function is used to escape special characters in HTML, but it does not seem to be directly related to the issue of adding an extra `php` tag. The `inherit` function is used for merging objects, which could be relevant if there is an issue with how language definitions are being merged.

```
src/lib/utils.js
function: inherit
```

#### --- src/languages/php.js ---
This file should contain the syntax highlighting configuration for PHP. Since the issue is related to PHP, this file is highly relevant. The language definition for PHP could be incorrectly adding the extra `php` tag.

```
src/languages/php.js
function: function_1
```
