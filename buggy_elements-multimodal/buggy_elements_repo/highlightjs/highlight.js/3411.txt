### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that in the type parameter `OutT`, the "Out" part is highlighted differently from the "T" part. This inconsistency in highlighting is not expected and does not match the desired behavior, where both parts should be highlighted uniformly as part of the same type parameter.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for TypeScript in the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the rules for recognizing and highlighting type parameters in TypeScript may not be correctly configured to treat the entire camel-cased type parameter as a single unit. This could be due to how the regular expressions or patterns for matching type parameters are defined, leading to the first part ("Out") being highlighted differently from the second part ("T").

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/javascript.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The issue is specific to TypeScript, so the JavaScript syntax highlighting rules are not directly relevant.

#### --- src/languages/typescript.js ---
```
src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in this file is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for TypeScript. The issue likely stems from how type parameters are defined and matched within this function. Specifically, the regular expressions or patterns used to identify type parameters may need to be adjusted to correctly handle camel-cased type parameters as a single unit.

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The types defined in this file are not directly related to the syntax highlighting rules and do not influence the highlighting behavior.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The primary location that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is:
```
src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```
