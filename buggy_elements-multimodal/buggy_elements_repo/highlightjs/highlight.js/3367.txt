### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that in the actual output, the keywords `if` and `else` are not being correctly identified and highlighted when they directly follow a number without a space. Instead, they are being treated as part of the number or string. The expected behavior is that these keywords should be properly separated and highlighted as keywords.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the regular expressions used to identify numbers, keywords, and other elements in the Python syntax highlighting configuration. Specifically, the regular expression for numbers might be too greedy and is capturing the subsequent keyword as part of the number. Alternatively, the regular expression for keywords might not be correctly handling cases where a keyword directly follows a number.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`

This file contains the core initialization and configuration module for the highlight.js library. While it contains the main highlighting logic and language management functions, the specific issue described is more likely related to the language-specific configuration rather than the core library functions. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/python.js`

This file contains the Python-specific syntax highlighting configuration. The issue described is directly related to how Python keywords and numbers are identified and highlighted. Therefore, we need to examine the relevant functions and classes in this file.

```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```

### Detailed Analysis of `src/languages/python.js`

In `function_1`, the following components are relevant to the issue:

1. **Keyword Definitions**: The `KEYWORDS` object categorizes Python keywords, built-in functions, and literals. We need to ensure that the keywords `if` and `else` are correctly defined and categorized.

2. **Number Pattern**: The regular expression used to identify numbers might be too greedy and capturing subsequent keywords. We need to review and possibly modify this pattern.

3. **Keyword Pattern**: The regular expression used to identify keywords might not be correctly handling cases where a keyword directly follows a number. We need to review and possibly modify this pattern.

### Conclusion

The relevant location for inspection or editing is:

```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```

This function contains the Python-specific syntax highlighting configuration, including the definitions and patterns for numbers and keywords, which need to be reviewed and potentially modified to fix the issue.
