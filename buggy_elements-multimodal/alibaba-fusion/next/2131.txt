### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that after upgrading to version 1.20.23, the Tree component is throwing an error: `Cannot add property pos, object is not extensible`. This indicates that the code is trying to add a `pos` property to an object that has been made non-extensible, meaning no new properties can be added to it.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error occurs because the `item` object in the `preHandleData` function is not extensible, and the code attempts to add a `pos` property to it. This can happen if the `item` object is frozen or sealed, preventing new properties from being added. The issue seems to be related to how the `item` object is being handled or created in the `preHandleData` function.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/tree/view/tree.jsx ---
```
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
function: function_15
```

The `function_15` (preHandleData) is relevant because it processes the nested data structure and adds metadata to each node, including the `pos` property. The issue described in the problem description is directly related to this function.

#### --- types/tree/index.d.ts ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Additional Analysis

The error `Cannot add property pos, object is not extensible` suggests that the `item` object being processed in the `preHandleData` function is not extensible. This could be due to the object being frozen or sealed somewhere in the codebase. To fix this issue, you should ensure that the `item` object is extensible before attempting to add the `pos` property to it. You can do this by checking if the object is extensible and making it extensible if necessary:

```javascript
if (!Object.isExtensible(item)) {
  Object.preventExtensions(item);
}
item.pos = pos;
```

Alternatively, you can create a new object with the required properties instead of modifying the existing `item` object:

```javascript
const newItem = { ...item, pos };
```

This approach ensures that the `pos` property is added without modifying the original `item` object.
