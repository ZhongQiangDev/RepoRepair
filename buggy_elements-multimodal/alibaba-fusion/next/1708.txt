### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when both disabled items and default values are enabled, the input box displays duplicate labels. This results in a warning message indicating that two children have the same key, which is unsupported and could cause issues in future versions.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the generation of non-unique keys for the tree nodes, especially when dealing with disabled items and default selected values. The warning message suggests that the same key is being assigned to multiple nodes, leading to the duplication of labels in the input box.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx ---
```
docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` (likely `createDataSource`) is responsible for generating unique keys for tree nodes. If this function does not ensure unique keys, especially for disabled items and default selected values, it could lead to the described issue.

#### --- src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx ---
```
src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx
class: TreeNode
```
The `TreeNode` class manages the rendering of individual nodes within the tree. If the keys generated for nodes are not unique, this class might render duplicate labels.

#### --- src/tree/view/tree.jsx ---
```
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
class: Tree
```
The `Tree` class manages the overall tree structure and its nodes. It could be relevant if there are issues with managing the state of expanded, selected, or checked nodes that affect key generation.

#### --- src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx ---
```
src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx
class: TreeSelect
```
The `TreeSelect` class combines the select input with the tree structure. It manages the visibility, value, and search functionality of the tree select. If there are issues with how it handles default values and disabled items, it could contribute to the problem.

#### --- types/tree-select/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file defines types and interfaces but does not contain any logic that could cause the described behavior.
