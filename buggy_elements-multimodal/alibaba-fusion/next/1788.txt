### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described involves a type mismatch for the `onBlur` event handler in TypeScript. Specifically, the type of the `onBlur` property is defined as `() => void`, but the actual implementation expects a function that takes an event parameter of type `MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>`. This mismatch causes a TypeScript error.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `onBlur` property in the TypeScript type definition (`InputProps`) is defined with an incorrect signature. It should accept an event parameter, but it is currently defined as a function that takes no parameters. This discrepancy leads to a type error when the actual implementation tries to pass an event object to the `onBlur` handler.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/input/base.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/input/input.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/mixin-ui-state/index.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/util/events.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `types/input/index.d.ts`

```
types/input/index.d.ts
function: InputProps
```

The `InputProps` interface defines the `onBlur` property, which is the source of the type mismatch. The `onBlur` property should be updated to accept an event parameter.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
types/input/index.d.ts
function: InputProps
```

### Suggested Fixes

To fix the issue, update the `onBlur` property in the `InputProps` interface to accept an event parameter:

```typescript
interface InputProps {
  // Other properties...
  onBlur?: (event: React.MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>) => void;
  // Other properties...
}
```

This change ensures that the `onBlur` property matches the expected signature of the event handler, resolving the TypeScript type error.
