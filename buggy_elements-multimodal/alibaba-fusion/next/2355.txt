### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described in the GitHub problem is that the `dataIndex` prop in the `Table.Column` component does not support string values in the format `'[start, end]'`. When such a string is used, it results in a `TypeError` because the code attempts to access properties on an undefined value.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue lies in how the `dataIndex` value is processed. Specifically, the `fetchDataByPath` function in `src/table/util.js` is responsible for fetching the value from the data source based on the `dataIndex`. When `dataIndex` is a string in the format `'[start, end]'`, the function attempts to treat it as an array index, leading to an error when it tries to access properties on an undefined value.

### Explanation

- **`Column` Class in `src/table/column.jsx`**: This class is where the `dataIndex` prop is defined and used. It needs to be inspected to ensure it handles the `dataIndex` value correctly, especially when it is in the format `'[start, end]'`.

- **`function_3` in `src/table/util.js`**: This function is responsible for fetching the value from the data source based on the `dataIndex`. It needs to be modified to handle the `dataIndex` value in the format `'[start, end]'` gracefully, returning `undefined` if the value is not found instead of throwing an error.
