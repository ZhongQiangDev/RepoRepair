### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `ConfigProvider` component is causing a memory leak in a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) environment. Specifically, the internal cache of `ConfigProvider` grows over time and cannot be garbage collected (GC) due to the nature of SSR, where the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method is not called.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the memory leak is that the `ConfigProvider` component uses an internal cache that is not being cleared when the component is unmounted. In a typical React application, the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method would be used to clean up resources like this cache. However, in an SSR environment, `componentWillUnmount` is not called, so the cache remains in memory and continues to grow with each request, leading to a memory leak.

#### --- src/config-provider/cache.js ---
```
file: src/config-provider/cache.js
class: Cache
```

The `Cache` class is likely used by `ConfigProvider` to manage its internal cache. This class needs to be inspected to understand how the cache is managed and potentially modified to provide a way to manually clear the cache.

#### --- src/config-provider/index.jsx ---
```
file: src/config-provider/index.jsx
class: ConfigProvider
```

The `ConfigProvider` class is the main component causing the memory leak. It needs to be inspected to understand how it uses the cache and how it can be modified to provide a way to manually clear the cache in an SSR environment.
