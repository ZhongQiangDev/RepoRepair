### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `Select` component does not display the `defaultValue` ("jack") when the `dataSource` is empty and the `fillProps` prop is used. Instead of showing "jack," the component appears to be empty.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `Select` component handles the `defaultValue` when the `dataSource` is empty. When `dataSource` is empty, the component may not have any options to match the `defaultValue`, leading to the value not being displayed. The `fillProps` prop might also play a role in how the value is filled into the input field, but if there are no options in `dataSource`, the component may not know how to handle the `defaultValue`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/select/index.jsx`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/select/option-group.jsx`

#### `src/select/option.jsx`

#### `src/select/select.jsx`

```
src/select/select.jsx
class: Select
```

The `Select` class is likely where the issue lies. The `defaultValue` and `fillProps` props are used here, and the component's behavior when `dataSource` is empty needs to be examined.

#### `types/select/index.d.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
