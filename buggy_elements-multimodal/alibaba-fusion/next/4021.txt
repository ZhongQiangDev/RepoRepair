### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `NumberPicker` component allows users to input values beyond the specified maximum value (`max`). Even though the component restricts the value to the maximum when the input loses focus (`onBlur`), the user can still input values greater than the maximum, leading to confusion as the displayed value changes automatically upon losing focus.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the lack of input validation during the `onChange` event. The `NumberPicker` component should prevent the user from entering values greater than the `max` value immediately when the input changes, rather than only correcting it when the input loses focus.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
   file: src/number-picker/index.jsx
   class: NumberPicker
   ```
2. ```
   file: src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
   class: NumberPicker
   ```

These two locations are relevant because they define the `NumberPicker` component, which needs to be modified to prevent users from entering values greater than the `max` value during the `onChange` event.
