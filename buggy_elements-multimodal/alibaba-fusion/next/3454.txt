### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `NumberPicker` component does not immediately reflect changes to the `max` value. Specifically, when the `max` value is increased, the component does not update its maximum limit in real-time, leading to unexpected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the `NumberPicker` component not properly re-rendering or updating its internal state when the `max` prop changes. This could be due to a few reasons:
- The `NumberPicker` component might not be listening for changes to the `max` prop.
- The `NumberPicker` might not be updating its internal state or re-rendering when the `max` prop changes.
- There might be a delay or issue in the event handling or state management that prevents the component from updating in real-time.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `docs/number-picker/adaptor/index.jsx`
This file contains functions that adapt the `NumberPicker` component for different configurations. These functions do not directly handle the `max` prop or the internal state of the `NumberPicker`. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/field/index.js`
This file contains classes related to form field management, such as `Field` and `NextField`. These classes are not directly related to the `NumberPicker` component or its `max` prop handling. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/number-picker/index.jsx`
This file contains the `NumberPicker` class, which is the main component in question. The `NumberPicker` class manages the component's state and props, including the `max` prop. Therefore:
```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

#### `src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx`
This file also contains the `NumberPicker` class, which is the main component in question. The `NumberPicker` class manages the component's state and props, including the `max` prop. Therefore:
```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

#### `types/number-picker/index.d.ts`
This file contains type definitions for the `NumberPicker` component. It does not contain any logic or implementation details that would affect the behavior of the component. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
