### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `Rating` component is given an `id` attribute and the user clicks to change the rating, the `onChange` callback is triggered twice, resulting in two console logs for a single click.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how event listeners are being attached and managed within the `Rating` component. Specifically, the `id` attribute might be causing an unintended re-render or event listener duplication, leading to the `onChange` callback being triggered twice.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `docs/rating/adaptor/index.jsx`
This file contains functions that adapt the `Rating` component for different configurations but does not directly handle event listeners or the `onChange` callback. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `docs/rating/theme/index.jsx`
This file is related to rendering the `Rating` component in different languages and sizes for demonstration purposes. It does not directly handle the `onChange` event or manage event listeners. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/rating/index.jsx`
This file contains a function that handles deprecated properties. It does not directly manage event listeners or the `onChange` callback. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/rating/rating.jsx`
This file contains the `Rating` class, which is the core component that handles user interactions and triggers the `onChange` callback. This is likely where the issue lies.
```
src/rating/rating.jsx
class: Rating
```

#### `src/util/events.js`
This file contains utility functions for managing event listeners. These functions could be used within the `Rating` component to attach and remove event listeners, so they might be relevant to the issue.
```
src/util/events.js
function: on
function: off
function: once
```
