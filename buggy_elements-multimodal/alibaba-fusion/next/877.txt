### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the overlay content collapses when the content is inline, and there is no space for the browser to render it properly. The issue is resolved by adding `width: 100%` to the overlay content.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely related to the CSS styling of the overlay content. When the content is inline, it may not have a defined width, causing it to collapse. Adding `width: 100%` ensures that the content takes up the full available width, preventing it from collapsing.

### Relevant Files and Locations

Based on the analysis, the issue is related to the styling of the overlay content. The relevant file is likely the one that renders the overlay content. Since the `Balloon` and `BalloonInner` components are not directly related to the overlay content, and the `Overlay`, `Popup`, and `Position` components do not seem to handle the specific styling issue, the problem might be in a different file not listed here.

However, if we assume the overlay content is rendered within the `Overlay` component, the relevant location would be:

```
src/overlay/overlay.jsx
class: Overlay
```

This is because the `Overlay` component manages the rendering and positioning of the overlay, and it might be responsible for applying the necessary styles to the overlay content. If the `Overlay` component does not handle the styling, then the issue might be in a different file that is not provided in the relevant files information.
