### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after a user selects all the results in the CascaderSelect component while using the search functionality, the search results do not clear automatically. This leaves the user on the search results page, even though they have already selected all the items. The user is unsure how to return to the full list view and must click outside the dropdown to reset the selection.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the lack of a mechanism to automatically clear the search results or provide a way for the user to manually clear the search results after all items have been selected. The component does not automatically reset the search state when all items are selected, leading to confusion for the user.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx
class: CascaderSelect
```
The `CascaderSelect` class is likely responsible for managing the search and selection behavior. It may need to include logic to clear the search results or provide a button to do so.

#### --- components/cascader-select/types.ts ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- components/search/Search.tsx ---
```
components/search/Search.tsx
function: function_6
```
The `function_6` function manages filter value changes and could be relevant for clearing the search results when all items are selected. However, it primarily deals with updating the filter value and notifying the parent component of changes.
