### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described in the GitHub problem is that when business logic encapsulates additional DOM structure around the form label, the `useLabelForErrorMessage` API does not work as expected. The user wants an additional `errorMessageLabel` API to work in conjunction with `useLabelForErrorMessage` to handle this scenario.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `useLabelForErrorMessage` API relies on a direct relationship between the label and the error message. When additional DOM structures are added around the label, this relationship is disrupted, causing the API to fail. The user needs a way to specify an alternative label for error messages when the default behavior is not sufficient.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/form/enhance.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/form/error.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/form/form.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/form/item.jsx ---
```
src/form/item.jsx
class: Item
```
The `Item` class is responsible for rendering form items, including labels and error messages. It is likely that the `errorMessageLabel` API would need to be implemented here to handle the additional DOM structure around the label.

#### --- types/form/index.d.ts ---
```
types/form/index.d.ts
function: ItemProps
```
The `ItemProps` interface defines the properties for the `Item` component. Adding a new property for `errorMessageLabel` would be necessary here to support the new API.
