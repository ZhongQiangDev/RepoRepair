### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the keyboard focus moves to the internal operation buttons of the `NumberPicker` component using the `Tab` key, the operation buttons remain hidden, and the focus state of the `NumberPicker` disappears. The expected behavior is that the operation buttons should be visible, and the `NumberPicker` should maintain its focus state using `:focus-within`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the following causes:
- The `NumberPicker` component does not properly handle the focus state when the focus moves to its internal operation buttons.
- The CSS styles for the operation buttons do not include the necessary visibility rules when they receive focus.
- The `:focus-within` pseudo-class is not being applied correctly to maintain the focus state of the `NumberPicker` when its internal elements are focused.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/input/base.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/mixin-ui-state/index.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/number-picker/index.jsx`
```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

#### `src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx`
```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

#### `src/util/focus.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
class: NumberPicker

src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

These locations are relevant because the `NumberPicker` class in both files is responsible for managing the focus state and rendering the operation buttons. The issue described likely requires modifications to the focus handling logic and the CSS styles within these classes.
