### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when a `Group` component is used with a `SubMenu` inside it, and there is a space in the `label` prop of the `Group`, it causes an error. The error message indicates that the `className` property of an undefined object is being accessed, which suggests that the `Group` component is not handling the `label` prop correctly when it contains spaces.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error occurs because the `Group` component is likely trying to access a property (`className`) on an object that is not properly defined when the `label` prop contains spaces. This could be due to improper handling of the `label` prop in the `Group` component, leading to unexpected behavior when rendering the group label.

The `Group` class is likely where the issue lies. The `render` method of the `Group` class may not be handling the `label` prop correctly when it contains spaces, leading to the error.
