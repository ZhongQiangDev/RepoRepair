### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the sorting icons in the table header do not have the `cursor: pointer` style applied. This means that when a user hovers over the sorting icons, the cursor does not change to indicate that the icons are clickable.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the CSS styles not being correctly applied to the sorting icons. Specifically, the `cursor: pointer` style is missing from the CSS rules for the sorting icons. This could be due to a missing CSS class or a missing style definition in the CSS file.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/table/base.jsx`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/table/index.jsx`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/table/base/header.jsx`
```
file: src/table/base/header.jsx
class: Header
```

The `Header` class is responsible for rendering the table header, including the sorting icons. The issue likely lies within this class where the sorting icons are rendered.

#### `src/table/base/sort.jsx`
```
file: src/table/base/sort.jsx
class: Sort
```

The `Sort` class is responsible for rendering the sorting UI elements, including the clickable icons. This class is directly related to the sorting functionality and likely needs to be inspected for the missing `cursor: pointer` style.

#### `types/table/index.d.ts`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
