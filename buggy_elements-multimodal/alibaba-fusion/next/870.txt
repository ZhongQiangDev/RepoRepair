### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

#### Overlay Issue:
- **Wrong Behavior**: The datepicker popup appears in the wrong position when there are two scrollbars and the user scrolls down while the datepicker is still in the viewport.

#### NumberPicker Issue:
- **Wrong Behavior**: The `innerBefore` style is incorrect and does not support `innerAfter`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Overlay Issue:
- **Possible Cause**: The positioning logic in the `Overlay` component or its related utilities might not correctly account for the presence of multiple scrollbars or changes in scroll position. This could lead to incorrect calculations of the popup's position relative to the target element.

#### NumberPicker Issue:
- **Possible Cause**: The styling for `innerBefore` and `innerAfter` might not be properly defined or supported in the `NumberPicker` component. This could be due to missing CSS rules or incorrect handling of these properties in the component's rendering logic.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/date-picker/date-picker.jsx
```
src/date-picker/date-picker.jsx
class: DatePicker
```
- **Relevance**: The `DatePicker` class manages the datepicker component, including its popup. The issue with the popup position might be related to how the popup is positioned or how scroll events are handled within this class.

#### src/overlay/manager.js
```
src/overlay/manager.js
function: addOverlay
function: isCurrentOverlay
function: removeOverlay
```
- **Relevance**: These functions manage the collection of overlays. While they might not directly cause the positioning issue, they could be relevant if the overlay management affects the order or visibility of overlays, which in turn affects positioning.

#### src/overlay/overlay.jsx
```
src/overlay/overlay.jsx
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
class: Overlay
```
- **Relevance**: The `Overlay` class and related functions handle the rendering and positioning of overlays. The `function_1` (isScrollDisplay), `function_2` (hasScroll), and `function_3` (getStyleProperty) might be relevant if they are used to determine the presence of scrollbars or other positioning-related properties.

#### src/overlay/position.jsx
```
src/overlay/position.jsx
class: Position
```
- **Relevance**: The `Position` class manages the dynamic positioning of child elements relative to a target. This class is likely directly involved in calculating and setting the position of the datepicker popup, making it highly relevant to the overlay issue.

#### src/overlay/utils/position.js
```
src/overlay/utils/position.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
class: Position
function: _getElementRect
function: _getViewportSize
```
- **Relevance**: The `Position` class and utility functions like `_getElementRect` and `_getViewportSize` are crucial for calculating the position of elements relative to the viewport and other elements. These functions might be responsible for the incorrect positioning when multiple scrollbars are present.

#### src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```
- **Relevance**: The `NumberPicker` class manages the number picker component. The issue with `innerBefore` and `innerAfter` styles likely involves the rendering logic and CSS handling within this class.
