### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `Field` component is modifying the input data, which is not the expected behavior. The issue is likely related to how the `Field` class handles and stores the `values` property.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be in the `Field` class's constructor or initialization logic. Specifically, the line `this.values = options.values || {};` directly assigns the `options.values` to `this.values`. This means that if `options.values` is an object, `this.values` will be a reference to the same object. Any modifications to `this.values` will also modify the original `options.values`, which is not desirable.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/field/index.js`

This file contains the `Field` class, which is directly related to the issue. The problematic line is in the constructor:

```
src/field/index.js
class: Field
```

#### `src/field/utils.js`

This file contains utility functions that are not directly related to the issue of modifying input data. However, functions like `setIn` and `getIn` could potentially be involved if they are used to modify `this.values`. But based on the problem description, the issue seems to be more about the initial assignment rather than subsequent modifications.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/form/index.jsx`

This file contains functions related to form properties and deprecation warnings. These functions do not seem to be directly related to the issue of modifying input data.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `types/field/index.d.ts`

This file contains TypeScript type definitions for the `Field` class and related options. While it defines the structure of the `Field` class, it does not contain any logic that could cause the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
