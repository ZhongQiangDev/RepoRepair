### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the "Upcoming Charges" section feels out of place and tacked on within the current billing history page layout. The suggestion is to move this section to a more appropriate location, such as under "Pending Payments" or into its own "Upcoming Charges" tab.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is primarily related to the current layout and structure of the billing history page. The "Upcoming Charges" section is currently rendered within the same container as past transactions, which makes it appear as an additional, less integrated part of the page. To fix this, the section needs to be moved to a more logical and visually distinct location, such as a separate tab or a dedicated section within the page.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions or Classes

#### --- client/me/billing-history/main.jsx ---
This file contains the main `BillingHistory` component, which renders the billing history page. The "Upcoming Charges" section is conditionally rendered within this component based on the `pastTransactions` prop. To move the "Upcoming Charges" section, we need to modify this file.

```
client/me/billing-history/main.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### --- client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx ---
This file contains the `UpcomingChargesTable` component, which is responsible for rendering the table of upcoming charges. This component will still be used, but its placement and rendering logic will change.

```
client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx
class: UpcomingChargesTable
```

#### --- client/me/purchases/purchases-list/header/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `PurchasesHeader` component, which is responsible for rendering the navigation tabs for different sections. To add a new "Upcoming Charges" tab, we need to modify this file.

```
client/me/purchases/purchases-list/header/index.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### --- client/state/selectors/get-past-billing-transactions.js ---
This file contains the `getPastBillingTransactions` selector, which retrieves past billing transactions from the Redux state. This selector is not directly related to the "Upcoming Charges" section, so no changes are needed here.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js ---
This file contains the `getUpcomingBillingTransactions` selector, which retrieves upcoming billing transactions from the Redux state. This selector is used by the `UpcomingChargesTable` component, so it remains relevant.

```
client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js
function: getUpcomingBillingTransactions
```
