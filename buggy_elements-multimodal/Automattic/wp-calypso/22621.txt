### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description outlines the need to introduce a new "Stats" step in the Jetpack Onboarding process. The wrong behavior involves the absence of this new step and the associated functionality. Specifically:

- The onboarding process should include a new step that allows users to enable the Stats module.
- When the user clicks the CTA button on the introduction screen, they should be directed to the JPC flow if they haven't connected yet.
- After connecting or if already connected, the Stats module should be enabled, and the user should be presented with a success screen.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the lack of implementation for the new "Stats" step in the onboarding process. This includes:

- Defining the new step in the onboarding flow.
- Implementing the logic to handle the CTA button click and navigate to the JPC flow if the user hasn't connected.
- Enabling the Stats module after connecting and displaying the success screen.
- Preserving the JPO wizard navigation back/skip links while in the JPC flow.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `client/jetpack-onboarding/index.js`
```
client/jetpack-onboarding/index.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains the routing logic for the Jetpack onboarding process. The `function_1` function defines the route for the onboarding process and will need to be updated to include the new "Stats" step.

#### `client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js`
```
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: function_4
function: function_5
```
This file contains action creators for Jetpack onboarding. New actions will need to be created for enabling the Stats module and handling the success state.

#### `client/state/jetpack-onboarding/reducer.js`
```
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/reducer.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```
This file contains reducers for Jetpack onboarding. New reducers will need to be added to handle the new actions related to the Stats module.

#### `client/state/ui/oauth2-clients/reducer.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to OAuth2 clients and does not seem directly relevant to the new Stats step.

#### `client/state/users/actions.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to user actions and does not seem directly relevant to the new Stats step.

#### `client/state/users/reducer.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to user reducers and does not seem directly relevant to the new Stats step.

#### `client/state/users/selectors.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to user selectors and does not seem directly relevant to the new Stats step.

#### `server/api/oauth.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to OAuth server-side functionality and does not seem directly relevant to the new Stats step.
