### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `localForage` library, which is used by WordPress.com/Calypso and Gutenberg, is licensed under Apache 2.0, which is incompatible with the GPLv2 license used by WordPress.com and Gutenberg. This incompatibility causes a license check failure during the build process, as shown in the error message from the screenshot.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the license incompatibility between Apache 2.0 and GPLv2. The Apache 2.0 license is considered incompatible with GPLv2 because it includes a patent grant clause that is not present in GPLv2. As a result, when Gutenberg runs a script to ensure dependency compatibility, it detects this incompatibility and fails the build process.

### Summary

The relevant functions are located in `client/lib/localforage/index.js` and `client/lib/localforage/localforage-bypass.js`. These files interact with the `localForage` library, which is the source of the license incompatibility issue. The functions listed above are directly related to the configuration and usage of `localForage`, and thus need to be inspected or edited to address the problem.
