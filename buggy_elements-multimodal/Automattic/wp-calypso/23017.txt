### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that Jetpack monthly plans are showing an error message indicating they will expire in a month, which causes unnecessary anxiety for users. This message appears even though there may not be an actual problem, especially if the purchase is using credits and cannot auto-renew.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from the logic that determines when to display the expiration warning. The system may be incorrectly flagging monthly Jetpack plans as expiring without considering the context of credits being used or other factors that prevent auto-renewal. This could be due to a misinterpretation of the `expiryStatus` or related properties in the purchase object.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One
