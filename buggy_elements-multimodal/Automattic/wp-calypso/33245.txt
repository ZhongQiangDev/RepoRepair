### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the "Priority support" card on the plans page has a different layout compared to other cards. Specifically, the "Priority support" card has the icon on the right and content on the left, while all other cards have the icon on the left and content on the right.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the "Priority support" card is rendered or styled. The layout discrepancy suggests that either the CSS styles applied to the "Priority support" card are different from those applied to other cards, or the HTML structure of the "Priority support" card is different.

The `PlanFeaturesItem` function is responsible for rendering a feature item within a plan. It includes the layout of the icon and content. The issue might be in how the `PlanFeaturesItem` function is rendering the "Priority support" card differently from other cards. Specifically, the placement of the `Gridicon` component and the `children` parameter might need to be adjusted to ensure the icon is on the left and the content is on the right.
