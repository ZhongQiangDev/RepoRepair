### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a non-admin user (subscriber) connects their site using Jetpack, they are redirected to `/jetpack/connect/plans`, but instead of seeing the plans page, they see the JPC initial site entry screen. This indicates that the redirection logic or the page rendering logic is not correctly handling the user's role or the connection status.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from a misconfiguration or a logic error in the redirection or rendering process. Specifically, the application might not be correctly identifying the user's role (subscriber vs. admin) or the connection status, leading to the incorrect rendering of the JPC initial site entry screen instead of the plans page.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### client/jetpack-connect/authorize.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### client/jetpack-connect/controller.js

```
client/jetpack-connect/controller.js
function: plansLanding
function: plansSelection
```

The `plansLanding` and `plansSelection` functions are responsible for managing the display and analytics for the Plans landing page and the plans selection process, respectively. These functions might need to be inspected to ensure they correctly handle the rendering of the plans page based on the user's role and connection status.

#### client/jetpack-connect/index.js

```
client/jetpack-connect/index.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function sets up routing for different URLs related to Jetpack Connect. It defines routes for various Jetpack Connect pages and associates them with specific middleware functions or controllers. This function should be inspected to ensure that the routing logic correctly handles the redirection for non-admin users.

#### client/jetpack-connect/main.jsx

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### client/jetpack-connect/plans.jsx

```
client/jetpack-connect/plans.jsx
function: function_1
class: Plans
```

The `function_1` function retrieves information about the user, site, and plan from the application state, which might be relevant to the issue. The `Plans` class manages the display and selection of subscription plans, and its methods like `maybeRedirect`, `redirectToWpAdmin`, and `render` should be inspected to ensure they correctly handle the redirection and rendering based on the user's role and connection status.
