### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after trashing a post, the user is immediately prompted with a restore dialog instead of seeing a success message or being redirected away from the editor. The user expects to see a success message or an undo button, and at the very least, not to be in the editor with a restore message.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the following:
- The trashing action is not being properly handled, leading to the post being marked as trashed but the editor state not being updated correctly.
- The restore dialog is being triggered because the editor still thinks the post is in an editable state, even though it has been trashed.
- There might be a problem with the state management or the lifecycle methods that handle the transition from editing to trashing.
