### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that currently, only an Administrator of a site (WordPress.com or Jetpack) can purchase a plan, and once they have purchased it, they are the owner and no one else can control that plan. The goal is to allow customers to transfer ownership of a purchased plan to any other Administrator on their site.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause behind this behavior is that the current system does not provide a mechanism for transferring ownership of a plan. The ownership is fixed at the time of purchase and cannot be changed. To fix this, we need to implement a feature that allows the current owner to transfer ownership to another Administrator on the site, including a confirmation process and notifications.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- client/lib/purchases/assembler.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/lib/purchases/index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/index.jsx ---
```
client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: ManagePurchase
```

#### --- client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/purchase-meta.jsx ---
```
client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/purchase-meta.jsx
function: function_1
class: PurchaseMeta
```

#### --- client/state/purchases/actions.js ---
```
client/state/purchases/actions.js
function: function_1
function: function_15
function: function_21
```

### Explanation

- **client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/index.jsx**: The `function_1` and `ManagePurchase` class are relevant because they handle the management and display of purchase details. The `ManagePurchase` class could be extended to include the functionality for transferring ownership.
  
- **client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/purchase-meta.jsx**: The `function_1` and `PurchaseMeta` class are relevant because they handle the display of purchase metadata, including the owner information. This class could be modified to include a clickable owner box for initiating the transfer process.
  
- **client/state/purchases/actions.js**: The functions `function_1`, `function_15`, and `function_21` are relevant because they handle actions related to purchases, such as fetching and removing purchases. New actions could be added to handle the transfer of ownership, including updating the purchase data and notifying the new owner.
