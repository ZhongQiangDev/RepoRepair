### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user switches from the signup form to the login form and then reloads the page, the OAuth client ID is lost. This results in the loss of styling and the user being presented with the standard WordPress.com login page instead of the styled login page.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the OAuth client ID is being managed and passed between the signup and login forms. When the user switches between forms, the client ID should be retained and included in the URL or state. However, it seems that the client ID is not being properly preserved, leading to its loss upon page reload.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/lib/paths/login/index.js`

This file contains the `login` function, which constructs a login URL. It includes the `oauth2ClientId` as a query parameter. This function is relevant because it is responsible for generating the login URL with the client ID.

```
client/lib/paths/login/index.js
function: login
```

#### `client/login/wp-login/index.jsx`

This file contains the `Login` class, which manages the user login process. The `oauth2Client` property is relevant as it holds the OAuth2 client information. The `renderContent` method renders the main content of the login page, which could be affected by the loss of the client ID.

```
client/login/wp-login/index.jsx
class: Login
```

#### `client/login/wp-login/login-links.jsx`

This file contains the `LoginLinks` class, which renders links related to the login process. The `oauth2Client` prop is relevant as it holds the OAuth2 client information. However, this class does not seem directly responsible for constructing or preserving the client ID in the URL.

```
client/login/wp-login/login-links.jsx
class: LoginLinks
```

#### `client/signup/wpcom-login-form/index.jsx`

This file contains the `WpcomLoginForm` class, which handles the login process for WordPress.com. The `redirectTo` prop is relevant as it includes the URL to which the user will be redirected after login. However, this class does not seem directly responsible for preserving the client ID between form switches.

```
client/signup/wpcom-login-form/index.jsx
class: WpcomLoginForm
```
