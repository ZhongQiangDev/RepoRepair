### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the word "account." appears on its own line at the end of the "Priority support" card text, which is undesirable. The expected behavior is for "your account." to stay on the same line, preventing a widow.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the text within the "Priority support" card is not being processed to prevent widows. The `preventWidows` function is intended to handle this by replacing spaces between the last few words with non-breaking spaces, ensuring they stay together. However, applying `preventWidows` directly to `this.getSupportText()` did not work due to the presence of the `<strong />` component, which likely interferes with the text processing.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx

This file contains the `HappinessSupport` class and the `getSupportText` method, which generates the text for the "Priority support" card. The issue is related to the text formatting, so this file is relevant.

#### client/lib/formatting/index.js
