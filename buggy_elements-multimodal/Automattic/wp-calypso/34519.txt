### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the nudge to download the mobile app was removed from the Checklist "congratulations" screen. The goal is to add this nudge back to the screen after a user completes all their tasks.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the code responsible for displaying the app nudge on the Checklist "congratulations" screen was removed or disabled. To fix this, we need to reintroduce the relevant code that displays the app nudge, ensuring it is correctly integrated into the "congratulations" screen.
