### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the upgrade nudge is being displayed on the media page for users with editor and author roles, even though these roles cannot upgrade the site. The upgrade nudge should only be visible to users with admin roles who have the capability to upgrade the site.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the lack of proper role-based checks when determining whether to display the upgrade nudge. The current implementation does not consider the user's role when deciding if the nudge should be shown. As a result, the nudge is displayed to all users, including those who cannot perform the upgrade action.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/blocks/domain-to-plan-nudge/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/blocks/upgrade-nudge-expanded/index.jsx ---

#### --- client/my-sites/media/main.jsx ---
```
client/my-sites/media/main.jsx
function: function_1
class: Media
```

The `function_1` function maps the selected site from the Redux state to the `Media` component's props. The `Media` component manages the media management functionalities, including displaying the media library and handling media items. It is likely that the upgrade nudge is displayed within this component, and the user's role should be checked before rendering the nudge.

#### --- client/my-sites/media-library/content.jsx ---
```
client/my-sites/media-library/content.jsx
function: function_1
class: MediaLibraryContent
```

The `function_1` function maps the site slug and fetching status to the `MediaLibraryContent` component's props. The `MediaLibraryContent` component is responsible for rendering the media library content, including the media list and header. It is possible that the upgrade nudge is displayed within this component, and the user's role should be checked before rendering the nudge.
