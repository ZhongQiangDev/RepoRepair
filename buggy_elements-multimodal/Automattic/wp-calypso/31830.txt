### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that an app banner is displayed within the mobile app when navigating to the "Stats" section of a site. This is unexpected because the user is already within the app, and the banner should not appear.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the logic that determines whether the app banner should be displayed. The banner is intended to appear only on mobile devices when the user is not already within the app. However, the current implementation does not correctly identify that the user is already in the app, leading to the banner being shown unnecessarily.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `AppBanner` class, which is responsible for rendering the app banner. The `isVisible()` method determines if the banner should be displayed based on the device type and dismissal status. This method might not be correctly identifying that the user is already within the app.

```
client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
class: AppBanner
```

#### --- client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js ---
This file contains utility functions that might be used by the `AppBanner` class to determine the current section and dismissal status. The `getCurrentSection` function could be relevant if it incorrectly identifies the current section.

```
client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js
function: getCurrentSection
```

#### --- client/lib/viewport/index.js ---
This file contains functions that determine the viewport width and whether the device is mobile or desktop. These functions might be used by the `AppBanner` class to determine if the device is mobile. However, they do not directly relate to identifying if the user is within the app.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/state/ui/selectors.js ---
This file contains selector functions that extract various pieces of UI state from the global state tree. The `getSection` and `getSectionName` functions could be relevant if they are used to determine the current section and whether the banner should be displayed.

```
client/state/ui/selectors.js
function: getSection
function: getSectionName
```
