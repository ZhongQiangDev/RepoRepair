### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a `Timer Intermediate Catch Event` is added to a non-default flow of an exclusive gateway, the `default` attribute of the exclusive gateway is removed. This results in the default flow being rendered without the `default` attribute, which is not the expected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the logic that handles the addition of intermediate events to the BPMN diagram. Specifically, when a `Timer Intermediate Catch Event` is added to a non-default flow, the code responsible for updating the BPMN model may inadvertently remove the `default` attribute from the exclusive gateway. This could be due to a lack of proper checks or incorrect handling of the gateway's properties during the event addition process.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js
function: ReplaceConnectionBehavior
```
The `ReplaceConnectionBehavior` function is relevant because it listens to events related to connection modifications and may be involved in the process of adding intermediate events to the diagram. Specifically, the `fixConnection` function within `ReplaceConnectionBehavior` could be responsible for modifying the connections and potentially removing the `default` attribute from the exclusive gateway.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` in `UpdatePropertiesHandler` is relevant because it updates properties of BPMN elements, including the `default` attribute of exclusive gateways. If the `default` attribute is being removed, this function might be involved in the process.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
function: function_4
```
The `function_4` in `Modeling.js` is relevant because it creates connections between elements. If the connection creation process is not properly handling the `default` attribute of exclusive gateways, this function could be involved in the issue.

#### --- lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js ---
```
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
function: canConnect
```
The `canConnect` function in `BpmnRules.js` is relevant because it determines whether a connection can be established between elements. If the rules for connecting intermediate events to exclusive gateways are not correctly defined, this function could be involved in the issue.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
function: function_4
```
The `function_4` in `BpmnFactory.js` is relevant because it creates BPMN elements. If the creation of intermediate events is not properly handling the `default` attribute of exclusive gateways, this function could be involved in the issue.
