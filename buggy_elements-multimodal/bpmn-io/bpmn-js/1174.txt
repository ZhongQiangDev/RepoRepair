### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when reconnecting the start and end of a connection with more than two waypoints to form a loop, the connection layout becomes incorrect. This issue is observed in both older (`bpmn-js@<=3`) and newer (`bpmn-js@4.0.0-beta.11`) versions of the library. The layout does not match what would be expected if the loop were created from scratch.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect layout likely stems from how the connection waypoints are recalculated or adjusted when the start and end of the connection are reconnected to form a loop. The existing waypoints may not be properly repositioned or the new waypoints may not be correctly inserted to maintain the intended layout. This could be due to issues in the layouting logic, particularly in how the connection's waypoints are managed during the reconnect operation.

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` function is responsible for determining the optimal path (waypoints) for a BPMN connection. It handles the layout of connections, including SequenceFlows, which are relevant to the described issue. The function may need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles the layout when forming a loop.
