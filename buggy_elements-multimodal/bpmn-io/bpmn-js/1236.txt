### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an expanded Sub Process with a child element inside is collapsed and then turned into an Ad Hoc Sub Process, the dimensions of the Sub Process change unexpectedly. The expected behavior is that the dimensions should remain unchanged.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the dimensions of the Sub Process are recalculated or updated when it is collapsed and then converted to an Ad Hoc Sub Process. The resizing logic might not be correctly handling the transition from an expanded state to a collapsed state and then to an Ad Hoc state, leading to incorrect dimensions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/auto-resize/BpmnAutoResize.js`

This file contains functions related to auto-resizing BPMN elements. The `BpmnAutoResize` function and the `resize` function could be relevant because they handle resizing operations. However, the specific issue described seems more related to collapsing and converting elements rather than auto-resizing.

```
lib/features/auto-resize/BpmnAutoResize.js
function: function_2
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`

This file contains functions related to updating BPMN elements. The `updateBounds` function is particularly relevant because it updates the bounds of shapes, which could be involved in the incorrect dimension changes.

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_19
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`

This file contains the `ResizeBehavior` function, which enforces minimum size constraints and resize rules for different types of BPMN elements. This could be relevant if the issue involves incorrect minimum dimensions being applied during the collapse or Ad Hoc conversion.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
function: ResizeBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`

This file contains the `ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour` function, which handles the collapse and expansion of BPMN sub-process elements. This is highly relevant because the issue involves collapsing a Sub Process.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
function: ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js`

This file contains functions related to resizing lanes. While it might not be directly related to the issue, it could be relevant if the problem involves lane resizing during the collapse or Ad Hoc conversion.

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: function_5
```
