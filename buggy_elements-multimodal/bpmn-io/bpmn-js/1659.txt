### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a connected shape (such as a subprocess) is resized, the labels and associations connected to the `SequenceFlow` do not move with it. Instead, they remain in their original positions, causing them to appear disconnected or "hanging."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises because the logic responsible for updating the positions of labels and associations after a shape is resized is not functioning correctly. Specifically, the functions responsible for calculating and applying the new positions of labels and associations based on the updated shape dimensions and connection waypoints may not be properly triggered or may not be calculating the new positions accurately.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js`

This file contains functions that manage the positioning of external labels associated with elements in a diagram. The `AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior` function listens to events related to the creation, layout, and updating of connections and labels and adjusts their positions accordingly. This file is relevant because it should handle the repositioning of labels when connections are updated.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js
function: AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior
function: checkLabelAdjustment
function: adjustLabelPosition
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`

This file contains functions that manage external labels in a BPMN diagram. The `LabelBehavior` function ensures that labels are synchronized with their associated elements during various operations, including updates to connection waypoints. This file is relevant because it should handle the repositioning of labels when connections are updated.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
function: LabelBehavior
function: getReferencePointDelta
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js`

This file contains functions that maintain the consistency of associations connected to connections when the connections undergo layout changes. The `LayoutConnectionBehavior` function updates the associated connections when the waypoints of a connection are updated. This file is relevant because it should handle the repositioning of labels when connections are updated.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js
function: LayoutConnectionBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/ConnectionLayoutUtil.js`

This file contains utility functions for adjusting the position of labels or points based on changes in the waypoints of a connection. The `getConnectionAdjustment` function calculates the adjusted position of a label or point based on the updated waypoints. This file is relevant because it should handle the repositioning of labels when connections are updated.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/ConnectionLayoutUtil.js
function: getConnectionAdjustment
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LabelLayoutUtil.js`

This file contains utility functions for adjusting the position of labels based on changes in the waypoints of a connection. The `getLabelAdjustment` function calculates the delta for moving a label when the waypoints of a connection are updated. This file is relevant because it should handle the repositioning of labels when connections are updated.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LabelLayoutUtil.js
function: getLabelAdjustment
```
