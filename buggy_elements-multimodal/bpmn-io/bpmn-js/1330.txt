### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that it is possible to connect a message flow to a boundary event, which should not be allowed according to BPMN semantics. The expected behavior is that the connection should be disallowed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the rules that govern the creation and validation of connections in the BPMN diagram. Specifically, the rules that determine whether a connection can be established between a source and a target element are not correctly enforcing the BPMN semantics that prohibit connecting a message flow to a boundary event.

function: canConnect

function: isMessageFlowTarget
function: isBoundaryEvent
```

The `canConnect` function is responsible for evaluating whether a connection can be established between a source and a target element. It should be checked to ensure that it correctly disallows connections from a message flow to a boundary event. The `isMessageFlowTarget` function checks if an element is a valid target for a message flow, and the `isBoundaryEvent` function checks if an element is a boundary event. These functions are relevant to the issue at hand.
