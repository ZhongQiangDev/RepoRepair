### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the BPMN 2.0 specification allows data objects to have an `isCollection` marker, but the current implementation does not support toggling this marker on data objects, inputs, or outputs. The desired behavior is to implement a feature similar to the multiple/ad-hoc modifiers on user tasks, allowing users to toggle the `isCollection` property.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the lack of implementation for the `isCollection` marker in the BPMN rendering and modeling logic. Specifically, the following components need to be updated:
- The rendering logic to visually represent the `isCollection` marker.
- The modeling logic to allow users to toggle the `isCollection` property.
- The popup menu to provide an option for toggling the `isCollection` marker.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
function: function_86
```
The `getShapePath` function is relevant because it generates the SVG path for BPMN elements. To support the `isCollection` marker, this function may need to be modified to include a visual representation of the marker for data objects.

#### lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
function: function_4
```
The `function_4` method is responsible for creating BPMN elements. To support the `isCollection` property, this function may need to be updated to allow setting the `isCollection` attribute when creating data objects.

#### lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
```
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
function: function_5
```
The `updateProperties` function is relevant because it updates the properties of a given element. This function may need to be modified to allow updating the `isCollection` property of data objects.

#### lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` method is responsible for updating BPMN element properties. This function may need to be updated to handle the `isCollection` property.

#### lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
```
lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
function: function_3
```
The `getEntries` function is relevant because it generates menu entries for elements. This function may need to be updated to include an option for toggling the `isCollection` marker for data objects.
