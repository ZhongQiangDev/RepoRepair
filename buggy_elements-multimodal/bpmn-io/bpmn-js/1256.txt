### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a child lane is removed from a parent lane in a BPMN diagram, the diagram becomes deformed. Specifically, the remaining lanes and the overall diagram layout are not adjusted correctly, leading to visual distortion and potential issues with further editing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the BPMN diagram handles the deletion of lanes and the subsequent adjustment of the remaining lanes. When a lane is deleted, the positions and sizes of the remaining lanes should be recalculated to maintain the integrity of the diagram's layout. If this recalculation is not performed correctly, the diagram will appear deformed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/DeleteLaneBehavior.js`

This file contains the `DeleteLaneBehavior` function, which is directly responsible for managing the deletion of lanes in the BPMN diagram. The `compensateLaneDelete` helper method within this function is specifically designed to adjust the positions of the remaining lanes after a lane has been deleted. Therefore, this file is highly relevant to the issue.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DeleteLaneBehavior.js
function: DeleteLaneBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeLaneBehavior.js`

This file contains the `ResizeLaneBehavior` function, which handles the resizing of lanes. While resizing is related to the layout of lanes, it is not directly involved in the deletion process. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js`

This file contains the `ResizeLaneHandler` function and related methods, which handle the resizing of lanes. Similar to the previous file, this is not directly related to the deletion of lanes. However, the `resizeSpace` method might be indirectly relevant if it affects the spacing of lanes after a deletion.

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js
function: ResizeLaneHandler
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js`

This file contains the `UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler` function and related methods, which handle the updating of flow node references. This is not directly related to the deletion of lanes or the adjustment of lane positions. Therefore, this file is not relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/util/LaneUtil.js`

This file contains several utility functions related to lanes, such as `collectLanes`, `computeLanesResize`, `getChildLanes`, `getLanesRoot`, and `getTRBLResize`. These functions are used to manage and calculate the positions and sizes of lanes, which are relevant to the issue of adjusting lanes after a deletion.

```
lib/features/modeling/util/LaneUtil.js
function: collectLanes
function: computeLanesResize
function: getChildLanes
function: getLanesRoot
function: getTRBLResize
```
