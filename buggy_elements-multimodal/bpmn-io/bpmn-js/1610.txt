### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the direct editing box remains open after switching planes, even though the element being edited is no longer visible. This indicates that the direct editing session is not properly canceled when the plane changes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the direct editing session is not being properly terminated when the plane changes. This could be due to a missing event listener or a failure to handle the plane change event correctly within the direct editing logic.

The `LabelEditingProvider` function listens to various events to manage the direct editing lifecycle. It should handle events like `canvas.viewbox.changing` to ensure the editing state is reset during plane changes. However, it may not be properly handling the plane change event.
