### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the snapping of connected elements on their docking points, which worked in `v3.x`, no longer functions in `v4-beta`. Specifically, when moving an event, the target snapping is missing, as shown in the provided GIFs.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in changes made to the snapping or docking logic between `v3.x` and `v4-beta`. The snapping mechanism that ensures elements align correctly with their docking points may have been altered or removed, leading to the observed behavior where elements no longer snap as expected.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ImportDockingFix.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ImportDockingFix.js
function: ImportDockingFix
function: getDistance
```

The `ImportDockingFix` function is responsible for correcting docking issues after importing BPMN diagrams. It listens for the 'bpmnElement.added' event and adjusts docking points if necessary. The `getDistance` function is used to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points, which could be relevant for determining docking points.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LineAttachmentUtil.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LineAttachmentUtil.js
function: getAttachment
function: getCircleSegmentIntersections
function: getDistance
function: isPointInSegment
function: mid
```

The `getAttachment` function calculates the attachment of a given point on a specified line, which is crucial for determining docking points. The `getCircleSegmentIntersections` function calculates intersection points between a circle and a line segment, which could be relevant for snapping logic. The `getDistance`, `isPointInSegment`, and `mid` functions are also relevant for geometric calculations involved in docking and snapping.

#### `lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/snapping/BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js`

```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js
function: setSnappedIfConstrained
```

This file is likely to contain the core snapping logic for BPMN elements. Since the issue is related to snapping, this file is highly relevant and should be inspected for any changes or issues that might have caused the snapping behavior to break.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ImportDockingFix.js
function: ImportDockingFix
function: getDistance
```

2. ```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LineAttachmentUtil.js

function: getDistance
function: isPointInSegment
function: mid
```

3. ```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js
function: setSnappedIfConstrained
```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the snapping issue.
