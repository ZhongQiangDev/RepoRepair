### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that associations on `bpmn:BoundaryEvents` can be created but are not rendered correctly when the BPMN diagram is imported. Specifically, the association between the boundary event and a data object is not displayed after the diagram is exported and re-imported.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way associations are handled during the import process. When the diagram is exported, the association information is included, but upon re-import, the association is not correctly reconstructed or rendered. This could be due to a missing or incorrect handling of the association data in the import logic, or a failure to properly link the association to the boundary event during rendering.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js`

This file contains functions related to rendering BPMN elements. The issue described is related to rendering associations, so this file is relevant.

```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
function: function_84
function: function_85
function: function_86
```

- `function_84`: This function is responsible for drawing shapes. It might need to be checked to ensure it correctly handles boundary events and their associations.
- `function_85`: This function is responsible for drawing connections. It might need to be checked to ensure it correctly handles associations.
- `function_86`: This function generates SVG paths for shapes. It might need to be checked to ensure it correctly handles the shape of boundary events.

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js`

This file contains functions related to creating BPMN elements. While it is involved in creating elements, it is less likely to be directly responsible for the rendering issue. However, it might still be relevant if there is an issue with how associations are created.

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
function: function_11
function: function_6
```

- `function_11`: This function creates BPMNEdges, which could be relevant if there is an issue with how associations are created.
- `function_6`: This function creates BPMNShapes, which could be relevant if there is an issue with how boundary events are created.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/BoundaryEventBehavior.js`

This file contains functions related to handling boundary events. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how boundary events are handled during the import process.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/BoundaryEventBehavior.js
function: BoundaryEventBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js`

This file contains functions related to creating boundary events. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how boundary events are created.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
function: CreateBoundaryEventBehavior
```

#### `lib/import/BpmnImporter.js`

This file contains functions related to importing BPMN elements. It is highly relevant to the issue described, as the problem occurs during the import process.

```
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
function: function_6
function: function_7
function: function_9
function: getWaypoints
```

- `function_6`: This function is responsible for adding elements to the canvas. It might need to be checked to ensure it correctly handles associations.
- `function_7`: This function is responsible for linking boundary elements to their host. It might need to be checked to ensure it correctly handles associations.
- `function_9`: This function retrieves the end of a connection. It might need to be checked to ensure it correctly handles associations.
- `getWaypoints`: This function generates waypoints for connections. It might need to be checked to ensure it correctly handles associations.
