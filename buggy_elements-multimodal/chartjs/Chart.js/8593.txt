### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the radar chart does not rotate as expected. The user wants to rotate the radar chart by a specific angle (1.22 * Math.PI), but the chart remains fixed at the default rotation angle (-0.5 * Math.PI).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the radar chart's rotation configuration not being properly set or applied. The rotation of the radar chart is typically controlled by the chart's configuration options, specifically the `startAngle` or similar property that determines the initial angle of the chart. If this property is not correctly set or if the chart's rendering logic does not respect this property, the chart will not rotate as intended.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.radar.js ---
This file contains the `RadarController` class, which is responsible for managing radar chart datasets. The rotation of the radar chart is likely handled within this class.

```
src/controllers/controller.radar.js
class: RadarController
```

#### --- src/core/core.config.js ---
This file contains various utility functions and the `Config` class, which manages configuration settings. While it contains functions related to configuration, it does not directly handle the rotation of the radar chart.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/core.defaults.js ---
This file contains the `Defaults` class, which manages default configurations for the chart. The default rotation angle might be set here, but it does not directly handle the rotation logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/platform/platform.dom.js ---
This file contains functions and classes related to DOM interactions and event handling. It does not directly handle the rotation of the radar chart.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js ---
This file contains the `RadialLinearScale` class, which handles the radial scale for the radar chart. The rotation of the chart is likely influenced by the angle calculations within this class.

```
src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js
class: RadialLinearScale
```
