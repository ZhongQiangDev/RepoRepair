### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in a Polar Area chart with a single data item, the entire circle is filled, but only the vertical line at the start of the arc is responsive to mouseover events. This means that the tooltip and click functionality are limited to a very small area (1-2 pixels wide), making it difficult for users to interact with the chart effectively.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the arc's interactive area is defined. In a Polar Area chart with a single data item, the arc spans the entire circle, but the interactive area might only be defined for the starting edge of the arc. This could be due to how the arc's boundaries are calculated or how the chart's interaction logic determines which elements are "in range" for mouse events.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.polarArea.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.polarArea.js
class: PolarAreaController
function: updateElements
function: _computeAngle
```
- **PolarAreaController**: This class manages the rendering and updating of the Polar Area chart. It is likely involved in defining the arc's properties and how it is rendered.
- **updateElements**: This function updates the properties of the arcs in the chart. It calculates the start and end angles for each arc and adjusts the outer radius based on visibility. It may need to be adjusted to ensure the entire arc is interactive.
- **_computeAngle**: This function computes the angle for a specific data element, considering visibility and custom angle options. It might need to be modified to ensure the entire arc is considered interactive.

#### --- src/core/core.interaction.js ---
```
src/core/core.interaction.js
function: getNearestItems
function: getAxisItems
function: evaluateInteractionItems
```
- **getNearestItems**: This function finds the nearest items in a chart relative to a given position. It might need to be adjusted to ensure that the entire arc is considered when determining the nearest item.
- **getAxisItems**: This function finds chart elements that intersect with a specific position along a given axis. It might need to be modified to ensure the entire arc is considered interactive.
- **evaluateInteractionItems**: This function processes items in a chart efficiently, especially when the data is sorted. It might need to be adjusted to ensure the entire arc is considered interactive.

#### --- src/elements/element.arc.js ---
```
src/elements/element.arc.js
class: ArcElement
function: inRange
```
- **ArcElement**: This class handles the properties and behaviors of an arc in a chart. It is likely involved in defining the arc's interactive area.
- **inRange**: This method checks if a given point lies within the arc's boundaries. It might need to be modified to ensure the entire arc is considered interactive.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js ---
```
src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js
function: afterEvent
function: nearest
```
- **afterEvent**: This function manages events that occur after a user interacts with a chart. It might need to be adjusted to ensure the tooltip is triggered for the entire arc.
- **nearest**: This function calculates the tooltip position of the item that is closest to the specified event position. It might need to be modified to ensure the entire arc is considered when determining the nearest item.

#### --- src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- The functions and classes in this file are related to the radial linear scale and its rendering, but they do not directly handle the interaction logic for the Polar Area chart.
