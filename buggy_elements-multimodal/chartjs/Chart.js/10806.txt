### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a pie chart is provided with an array containing a single non-zero value (e.g., `385`) while the rest are zeros, and the `hoverOffset` option is used, the chart displays incorrectly when hovering. Specifically, the border of the initial circle appears, which should not happen.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `hoverOffset` is applied when the pie chart has a single non-zero value. The `hoverOffset` might be causing the arc's geometry to be calculated incorrectly, leading to the appearance of the initial circle's border. This could be due to improper handling of the arc's start and end angles, radii, or the way the arc is clipped and drawn during the hover effect.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.doughnut.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/controllers/controller.pie.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.pie.js
class: PieController
```
The `PieController` class is relevant because it manages the rendering of pie charts. The issue might be related to how the pie chart's arcs are updated and rendered during hover events.

#### --- src/core/core.animations.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/core/core.interaction.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/elements/element.arc.ts ---
```
src/elements/element.arc.ts
class: ArcElement
function: drawArc
function: drawBorder
function: clipArc
function: pathArc
```
The `ArcElement` class and its related functions are highly relevant. The `drawArc`, `drawBorder`, `clipArc`, and `pathArc` functions are responsible for rendering the arcs and their borders, which are directly involved in the hover effect and the potential appearance of the initial circle's border.
