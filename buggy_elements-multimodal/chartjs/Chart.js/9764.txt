### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `hoverRadius` is set to `0`, the bubble disappears on hover instead of maintaining the same size as when not hovered. Conversely, when the `hoverRadius` is set to the same value as the `radius`, the bubble gets bigger on hover, which is contrary to the expected behavior where `hoverRadius` should add to the original radius.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `hoverRadius` is applied to the bubble's radius during the hover interaction. The expected behavior is that `hoverRadius` should be an additional radius, meaning the total radius on hover should be `radius + hoverRadius`. If `hoverRadius` is `0`, the bubble should not change size. If `hoverRadius` is equal to `radius`, the bubble should double in size, but this should be a consistent addition rather than a replacement.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- src/controllers/controller.bubble.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.bubble.js
class: BubbleController
```
The `BubbleController` class is responsible for handling the data and rendering logic specific to bubble charts. The issue likely involves how the `hoverRadius` is applied during the update of the bubble elements. The `updateElements` method and `resolveDataElementOptions` method within this class are likely relevant.

#### --- src/core/core.element.js ---
```
src/core/core.element.js
class: Element
```
The `Element` class manages the properties of an element, including its radius. While this class is fundamental, the specific issue with `hoverRadius` is more likely tied to the `BubbleController` class.

#### --- src/core/core.interaction.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to interaction modes and finding elements based on user input, but they do not directly handle the radius calculations for bubble elements.

#### --- src/elements/element.point.js ---
```
src/elements/element.point.js
function: inRange
class: PointElement
```
The `PointElement` class and the `inRange` function are relevant because they handle the interaction logic for point elements, including bubbles. The `inRange` function checks if a point is within a certain range, which could be affected by the `hoverRadius`.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to drawing and rendering on the canvas but do not directly handle the logic for applying `hoverRadius` to bubble elements.
