### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the rightmost data point in the line chart is getting cropped off, even though the tooltip for that point is displayed correctly. This indicates that the chart's rendering area is not properly accommodating the last data point.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the chart's dimensions are calculated and how the data points are positioned within the chart area. Specifically, the chart's width might not be accounting for the space needed for the last data point, causing it to be cropped off. This could be related to padding, margin calculations, or the way the chart area is defined.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.line.js ---

```
src/controllers/controller.line.js
function: getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints
class: LineController
```

The `getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints` function and the `LineController` class are directly involved in determining which data points are visible and how they are rendered. The function calculates the visible range of points based on the scale's bounds, which could be related to the issue of the rightmost point being cropped. The `LineController` class manages the rendering and updating of the line chart, so it is also relevant.

#### --- src/core/core.controller.js ---

```
src/core/core.controller.js
class: Chart
function: update
function: onAnimationProgress
function: onAnimationsComplete
```

The `Chart` class is responsible for managing the overall chart, including its dimensions and rendering. The `update` function handles the layout and rendering of the chart, which could be where the issue lies. The `onAnimationProgress` and `onAnimationsComplete` functions manage animations, which might affect how the chart is rendered during and after animations.

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---

```
src/core/core.layouts.js
function: fitBoxes
function: placeBoxes
function: update
```

The `fitBoxes` and `placeBoxes` functions are responsible for positioning and fitting layout elements within the chart area, which could be related to the issue of the rightmost point being cropped. The `update` function in this file also manages the layout and dimensions of the chart.

#### --- src/platform/platform.dom.js ---

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to event handling and DOM manipulation, which are not directly related to the issue of the rightmost data point being cropped.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---

```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
class: LinearScale
```

The `LinearScale` class is responsible for determining the data limits and converting between data values and pixel positions. While it is related to the scale of the chart, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the cropping issue, but it could still be relevant if there are issues with the scale's range or pixel calculations.
