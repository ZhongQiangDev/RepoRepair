### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that a `RangeError` is being thrown due to the `minimumFractionDigits` value being out of range when creating a new `Chart` instance. This error occurs during the chart creation process, specifically when the `getNumberFormat` function is called, which is used to format numbers for display on the chart.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the error appears to be related to the `minimumFractionDigits` option being set to `NaN` or an invalid value when creating the `Intl.NumberFormat` instance. This can happen if the options passed to `getNumberFormat` are not properly validated or if they are being set incorrectly elsewhere in the code. The error is triggered when `getNumberFormat` tries to create a new `Intl.NumberFormat` instance with invalid options.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/core/core.controller.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.intl.js ---
```
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
function: getNumberFormat
function: formatNumber
```

The `getNumberFormat` function is directly involved in the error since it is responsible for creating the `Intl.NumberFormat` instance. The `formatNumber` function uses `getNumberFormat` to format numbers, which is where the error is likely being triggered.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The relevant locations that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
function: getNumberFormat
function: formatNumber
```

These functions need to be inspected to ensure that the `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` options are properly validated before being passed to `Intl.NumberFormat`. Additionally, any code that sets these options should be reviewed to ensure they are not being set to invalid values.
