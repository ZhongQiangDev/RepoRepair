### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Lighthouse report shows "Emulated Moto G4" even though the user is testing on a real Moto Power G device. The user expects the report to indicate that the test was conducted on a real device, not an emulated one.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how Lighthouse determines and reports the device being used for testing. Despite the user running Lighthouse on a real device, the report still indicates an emulated device. This could be due to incorrect device detection, misconfiguration in the Lighthouse settings, or an issue with how the device information is being passed and reported.

function: emulate
```
The `emulate` function is responsible for applying user agent and screen emulation settings to a browser session. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how the user agent or screen emulation is being set, leading to the report indicating an emulated device.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- report/renderer/report-renderer.js ---
```
report/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```
The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the Lighthouse report into a DOM element. It includes methods for rendering various parts of the report, including metadata about the device and network conditions. If there is an issue with how the device information is being rendered, this class could be relevant.
