### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that iframes and data URIs are being considered as part of the critical request chains (CRCs) even though they are not render-blocking. Specifically:

- **Iframes**: These are fetched at a high priority but do not block the initial render of the page. Including them in the CRC tree can lead to misleading performance insights.
- **Data URIs**: These are not actual network requests and should not be included in the CRC analysis.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the logic that determines whether a request is considered "critical." The current implementation seems to classify requests based on their priority level (e.g., 'VeryHigh', 'High', 'Medium') without considering whether they are render-blocking or if they are data URIs.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js
class: CriticalRequestChains
```
This file contains the main audit logic for critical request chains. The `_getLongestChain` and `audit` methods might need to be adjusted to exclude iframes and data URIs from the CRC tree.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js
class: CriticalRequestChains
```
The `isCritical` method in this file is crucial for determining if a request should be considered critical. It currently checks priority and resource type but does not specifically exclude iframes or data URIs. The `extractChain` method also needs to be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles these cases.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/computed/page-dependency-graph.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file focuses on constructing a dependency graph between network requests and CPU tasks, which is not directly related to the classification of iframes and data URIs in CRCs.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js
class: NetworkNode
```
The `NetworkNode` class contains methods like `hasRenderBlockingPriority` which might need to be updated to correctly identify iframes and data URIs.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is responsible for rendering the CRC tree visually and does not directly influence the classification of requests as critical. However, it might need minor adjustments if the underlying data structure changes.
