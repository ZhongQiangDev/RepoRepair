### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the report meta block does not include the emulated screen dimensions (`width`, `height`) and `deviceScaleFactor` in the tooltip alongside other device-related information like CPU/Memory power and CPU throttling.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the fact that the relevant properties (`width`, `height`, and `deviceScaleFactor`) are not being included in the metadata block when the report is rendered. This could be due to missing logic in the code that processes and displays the metadata.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- core/config/config-helpers.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- core/lib/emulation.js ---

```
report/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```
The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the Lighthouse report, including the metadata block. The `_renderMetaBlock` method within this class is likely where the metadata is rendered, and it should include the screen dimensions and `deviceScaleFactor`.

#### --- types/lhr/settings.d.ts ---
```
types/lhr/settings.d.ts
function: ScreenEmulationSettings
```
The `ScreenEmulationSettings` interface defines the properties for screen emulation, including `width`, `height`, and `deviceScaleFactor`. These properties should be included in the metadata block.
