### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse (LH) is suggesting the use of `dns-prefetch` and/or `preconnect` for origins that the user has already preconnected to via `<link rel="preconnect">` tags in the HTML. This results in a false positive audit suggestion.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely that the Lighthouse audit does not properly detect or account for the `<link rel="preconnect">` tags already present in the HTML. As a result, it incorrectly identifies these origins as candidates for preconnection, leading to the false positive suggestion.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/uses-rel-preconnect.js`

This file contains the `UsesRelPreconnectAudit` class, which is directly related to the audit that checks for the use of `rel=preconnect`. The issue described in the GitHub problem description is likely related to this class, as it is responsible for identifying opportunities where `preconnect` could be used.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/uses-rel-preconnect.js
class: UsesRelPreconnectAudit
```

#### `lighthouse-core/computed/critical-request-chains.js`

This file contains the `CriticalRequestChains` class, which is used to analyze network requests and determine critical request chains. While this class is important for performance analysis, it does not directly relate to the issue of false positives in the `preconnect` audit.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/config/default-config.js`

This file contains a simple getter function `function_1` that returns the `UIStrings` object. This function is not directly related to the audit process or the detection of `preconnect` tags.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/cache-contents.js`

This file contains the `CacheContents` class and the `getCacheContents` function, which are used to gather and retrieve cached URLs. These are not directly related to the `preconnect` audit.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js`

This file contains the `NetworkNode` class, which encapsulates a network request record and provides methods to analyze its properties. While this class is used in performance analysis, it does not directly relate to the issue of false positives in the `preconnect` audit.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
