### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the "Avoid multiple page redirects" opportunity is being squished in the report, making it difficult to read or interpret. Specifically, the estimated savings for this opportunity are not displayed in the same manner as other opportunities, which may lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the data.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the "Avoid multiple page redirects" opportunity is being rendered in the report. The problem could be due to:

- Incorrect formatting or styling of the opportunity in the HTML report.
- A bug in the rendering logic that handles the display of opportunities.
- An issue with the data structure or the way the opportunity data is being passed to the rendering functions.
