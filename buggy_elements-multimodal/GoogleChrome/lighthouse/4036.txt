### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that adding `rel="noopener"` to `mailto:` links causes them to break on Chrome for Android and iOS Safari. Specifically, the support link fails to launch the email client, while the sales link without `rel="noopener"` works correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because `rel="noopener"` is intended for external links that open in a new tab or window. When applied to `mailto:` links, it interferes with the expected behavior of launching the default email client. This is likely because `mailto:` links are not standard external links and do not follow the same rules as `http` or `https` links.
