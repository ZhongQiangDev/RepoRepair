### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `minification-estimator` incorrectly reports that the provided JavaScript code is not minified, even though it is. The code in question is:

`javascript
switch(true){case/^hello!/.test("hello!"):document.write("///<any content>");} 
`

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect report is that the `hasPunctuatorBefore` function in `lighthouse-core/lib/minification-estimator.js` incorrectly identifies the `/` after `case` as a division operator instead of recognizing it as part of a regular expression. This leads to the function misinterpreting the subsequent `/` as the end of the regular expression and the `//` as the start of a comment, causing the rest of the code to be treated as a comment.
