### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two main issues:

1. **Duplicated Stack Packs**: The `stackPacks` array contains duplicate entries for the same library (e.g., React), which is causing confusion and redundancy in the audit results.
2. **Experimental Entries in User Interface**: The new experimental `React (Fast Path)` entries are being shown to users within the `bestpractices/js-libraries` audit, which was not intended for user visibility.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the duplicated stack packs is likely due to the addition of the new "Fast Path" checks in the `js-library-detector`. This addition introduced a new detection mechanism that resulted in multiple detections for the same library, leading to duplicate entries in the `stackPacks` array.

The cause of the experimental entries being shown to users is likely due to the lack of proper filtering or configuration in the `JsLibrariesAudit` class, which is responsible for presenting the audit results. The new experimental entries were not intended to be user-visible but were not properly hidden from the user interface.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js
class: JsLibrariesAudit
```
The `JsLibrariesAudit` class is responsible for filtering and mapping JavaScript library details and constructing the audit report. It needs to be inspected to ensure that it properly filters out experimental entries and handles duplicate stack packs.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/js-usage.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `JsUsage` class is related to monitoring and collecting data on JavaScript code usage, which is not directly related to the issues described.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
function: collectStacks
function: detectLibraries
```
The `collectStacks` function collects information about JavaScript libraries and maps them to a specific structure. The `detectLibraries` function detects JavaScript libraries and could be contributing to the duplicate entries if it is not properly handling the new "Fast Path" checks.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/stack-packs.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-packs.js
function: getStackPacks
```
The `getStackPacks` function processes the `pageStacks` to find and return an array of stack packs. It needs to be inspected to ensure that it properly handles duplicate stack packs and includes only unique entries.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/util.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Util` class and `function_1` are utility functions and do not directly relate to the issues described.
