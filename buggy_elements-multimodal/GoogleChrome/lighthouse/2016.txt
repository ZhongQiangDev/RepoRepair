### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when there are 0 passing audits, the report still shows a "View 0 passed items" dropdown. This is unexpected because if there are no passing audits, there should be no dropdown for viewing passed items.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the logic that determines whether to display the "View passed items" dropdown. The code responsible for rendering the report should check if there are any passing audits before displaying the dropdown. If there are no passing audits, the dropdown should not be shown.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/report/report-generator.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/scripts/logger.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```

The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the report, including categories, audits, and their respective scores. The issue likely lies within this class, specifically in the logic that determines whether to display the "View passed items" dropdown. The `_renderCategory` or `_renderAudit` methods might be responsible for rendering the dropdown, and they should check if there are any passing audits before displaying it.
