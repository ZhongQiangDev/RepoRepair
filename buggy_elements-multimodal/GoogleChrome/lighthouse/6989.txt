### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that warnings within the "Passed Audits" section are not currently visible. The plan is to add a block of warnings following the "Passed Audits" section to ensure these warnings are visible to the user.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the current rendering logic of the "Passed Audits" section not including a mechanism to display warnings. The rendering logic may only display the audits that have passed without considering any associated warnings.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/category-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/category-renderer.js
class: CategoryRenderer
```

The `CategoryRenderer` class is responsible for rendering audit results into a structured report. It includes methods for rendering audits and grouping them. The `_renderGroupedAudits` method organizes audits into groups, and the `renderAudit` method creates individual audit elements. These methods may need to be modified to include warnings for passed audits.
