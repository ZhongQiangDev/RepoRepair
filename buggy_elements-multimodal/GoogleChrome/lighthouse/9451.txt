### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that Lighthouse reports the start URL does not load offline, but the current page does. Specifically, during the offline pass, the desktop version of the page is loaded instead of the expected offline fallback page. Additionally, the network requests during the offline pass do not show `fromServiceWorker` or `fromDiskCache` flags as `true`, which should be the case when offline.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior could be related to how Lighthouse simulates the offline state and how it checks for the availability of the start URL offline. The issue might stem from:

- Incorrectly setting the browser to an offline state.
- Not properly checking if the start URL is available via a service worker when offline.
- Misinterpretation of network request flags (`fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache`) during the offline pass.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js
class: Driver
```
The `Driver` class is responsible for managing the browser's state, including going offline. The `goOffline` method within this class is likely involved in setting the browser to an offline state. If this method does not correctly simulate an offline environment, it could lead to the observed behavior.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/offline.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/offline.js
class: Offline
```
The `Offline` class simulates an offline state during a specific phase of page navigation. The `beforePass` method sets the browser to an offline state, and the `afterPass` method checks if the page was fetched via a service worker. If these methods do not work as expected, it could result in the desktop version being loaded instead of the offline fallback page.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
class: StartUrl
```
The `StartUrl` class evaluates the start URL to ensure it is available offline. The `_determineStartUrlAvailability` and `_attemptStartURLFetch` methods check if the start URL can be fetched while offline. If these methods do not correctly simulate the offline state or misinterpret the fetch results, it could lead to the issue described.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/service-worker.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `ServiceWorker` class retrieves information about service workers but does not directly handle the offline simulation or start URL availability checks.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
function: goOffline
```
The `goOffline` function sends a command to the driver to simulate offline network conditions. If this function does not correctly set the browser to an offline state, it could contribute to the problem.
