### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `width` and `height` are specified in percentage (`%`) in the Reveal.js presentation configuration, the presentation does not appear at all, resulting in a blank screen. However, when the `width` and `height` are specified in pixels, the presentation displays correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `width` and `height` values are being processed and applied to the Reveal.js presentation. When using percentage values, the system might not be correctly interpreting or applying these values, leading to a layout issue that results in a blank screen. This could be due to a lack of proper handling of percentage values in the configuration or a problem with the template that generates the presentation HTML.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/format/reveal/format-reveal-multiplex.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/format/reveal/format-reveal-plugin.ts`

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
function: revealHtmlPostprocessor
function: revealjsFormat
function: revealResolveFormat
```

The `revealHtmlPostprocessor` function is responsible for transforming the HTML document into a format suitable for Reveal.js presentations. It handles various configurations and settings, including slide level, headings, and initialization fixups. If there is an issue with how percentage values for `width` and `height` are handled, it could be related to this function.

The `revealjsFormat` function sets up the presentation format for Reveal.js, including merging configurations, setting up MathJax, and handling themes and plugins. If the issue is related to the initial setup of the presentation, this function could be relevant.

The `revealResolveFormat` function processes the metadata and adjusts the `navigationMode` property. While it may not directly handle `width` and `height`, it is involved in processing the metadata, which could indirectly affect the issue.

### Conclusion

The functions `revealHtmlPostprocessor`, `revealjsFormat`, and `revealResolveFormat` in `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts` are the most likely candidates for inspection or editing to fix the problem. These functions are involved in processing the presentation configuration and metadata, which could be where the issue with percentage values for `width` and `height` is occurring.
