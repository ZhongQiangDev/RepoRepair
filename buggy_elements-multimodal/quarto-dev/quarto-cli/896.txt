### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that images are not being placed correctly within custom divs in a Reveal.js presentation. Specifically, in `Test A: custom block` and `Test C: outer div`, the image is placed outside the div instead of between the text "Oh hello" and "Why not?" as expected. However, in `Test B: columns`, the image is correctly placed within the column.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the Reveal.js rendering engine processes custom divs versus columns. Columns seem to be handled differently, allowing images to be placed correctly within them. The problem may be related to how the custom divs are being interpreted or how the image placement logic is applied within these divs.

The `revealHtmlPostprocessor` function is responsible for post-processing the HTML document to prepare it for Reveal.js. It includes operations like modifying Reveal.initialize scripts, managing visibility, processing slide headings, and applying stretch classes to images. If there is an issue with how images are being placed within custom divs, this function could be a relevant place to investigate.

The `applyStretch` function processes slides to automatically stretch standalone images. While it may not directly cause the issue, it could be indirectly related if it affects the placement or styling of images within divs.
