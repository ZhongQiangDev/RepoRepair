### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect labeling of subfigures when cross-reference information is not explicitly provided. In the first example, the subfigures are labeled as "Figure 1" and "Figure 2," which are treated as separate figures rather than subfigures of a single figure. In the second example, with explicit cross-reference information, the subfigures are correctly labeled as "(a) Surus" and "(b) Hanno," which are subfigures of "Figure 1: Famous Elephants."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the Quarto rendering engine does not automatically generate cross-reference information for subfigures unless explicitly provided. When subfigures are defined without explicit labels, the rendering engine treats each subfigure as an independent figure, leading to incorrect labeling. When explicit labels are provided, the rendering engine correctly identifies them as subfigures and generates the appropriate cross-reference information.
