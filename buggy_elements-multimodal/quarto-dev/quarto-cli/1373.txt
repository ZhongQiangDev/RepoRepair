### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `code-tools` menu does not show up when the `source` parameter is set to a URL (e.g., `https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/index.md`). However, when `source: true` is used, the `code-tools` menu appears as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `code-tools` function handles the `source` parameter when it is a URL versus a boolean value. When `source` is a URL, the function may not correctly interpret or process it, leading to the absence of the `code-tools` menu. This suggests a problem in the logic that determines whether to display the `code-tools` menu based on the `source` parameter.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/command/render/codetools.ts`

```
src/command/render/codetools.ts
function: resolveCodeTools
function: codeToolsPostprocessor
function: formatHasCodeTools
```

**Reasoning:**
- `resolveCodeTools`: This function resolves the `codeTools` configuration and determines the `source` property. It may need to handle the case where `source` is a URL differently.
- `codeToolsPostprocessor`: This function injects code tools into the document. It might need to check if the `source` is a URL and handle it appropriately.
- `formatHasCodeTools`: This function checks if the format supports code tools. It might need to consider the URL case for `source`.

#### `src/command/render/defaults.ts`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Reasoning:**
- The functions in this file are related to generating Pandoc defaults and do not directly handle the `code-tools` configuration.

#### `src/command/render/render-shared.ts`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Reasoning:**
- The functions in this file are related to rendering and previewing URLs, but they do not directly handle the `code-tools` configuration.

#### `src/command/render/render.ts`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Reasoning:**
- The functions in this file are related to rendering Pandoc and post-processing HTML but do not directly handle the `code-tools` configuration.

#### `src/format/html/format-html-shared.ts`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Reasoning:**
- The functions in this file are related to creating code blocks, buttons, and other HTML elements but do not directly handle the `code-tools` configuration.

### Summary

The relevant functions that need inspection or editing are located in `src/command/render/codetools.ts`. These functions are directly involved in handling the `code-tools` configuration and determining whether to display the `code-tools` menu based on the `source` parameter.
