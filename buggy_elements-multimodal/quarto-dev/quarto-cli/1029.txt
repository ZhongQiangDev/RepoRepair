### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using the `aside` class on a slide with a single figure, the figure is stretched too much, and the `aside` content overlaps the bottom of the figure. If the figure has a caption, the caption even goes below the `aside` content. The desired behavior is for the `aside` contents to have priority and always take the bottom part of the slide, with the figure stretched to the top of the `aside` block.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `aside` class and the `r-stretch` class are styled and positioned within the slide. The `r-stretch` class is probably causing the figure to stretch to fill the entire slide, which conflicts with the `aside` class that is supposed to occupy the bottom part of the slide. The overlap and caption issues suggest that the CSS styles for these classes are not correctly managing the layout and positioning.

function: applyStretch

- **`applyStretch`**: This function processes images within slides and applies the `r-stretch` class under certain conditions. It may be responsible for the stretching behavior of the figure, which conflicts with the `aside` content.
- **`revealHtmlPostprocessor`**: This function handles various post-processing tasks for the Reveal.js presentation, including image stretching and aside/footnote collection. It may need to be adjusted to ensure that the `aside` content has priority over the figure.
