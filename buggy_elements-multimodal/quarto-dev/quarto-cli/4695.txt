### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the links in the `index.qmd` file, which work correctly in the local preview, do not appear as links when published to Confluence. Instead, they are displayed as plain text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the links are being processed and rendered during the publishing process to Confluence. The local preview correctly interprets the Markdown links, but the Confluence publishing process may not be handling the link syntax in the same way. This could be due to differences in how Markdown is converted to HTML or how Confluence expects links to be formatted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/publish/common/publish.ts ---
```
src/publish/common/publish.ts
function: renderForPublish
function: stageDocumentPublish
```
These functions are involved in preparing files for publishing. `renderForPublish` ensures that the files meet the provider's requirements, and `stageDocumentPublish` handles the organization and processing of files for publishing. If the link formatting is not being preserved during these steps, it could lead to the issue.

#### --- src/publish/confluence/confluence-helper.ts ---
```
src/publish/confluence/confluence-helper.ts
function: function_57
function: function_60
```
`function_57` (`updateLinks`) processes an array of `ConfluenceSpaceChange` objects to update hyperlinks within the content. If this function is not correctly handling the links from `index.qmd`, it could be a cause of the issue. `function_60` (`convertForSecondPass`) processes changes for a second pass of updates, which might also be relevant if it affects link handling.

#### --- src/publish/confluence/confluence.ts ---
```
src/publish/confluence/confluence.ts
function: publish
```
The `publish` function is a comprehensive handler for publishing content to Confluence. It includes logic for creating, updating, and managing content, including handling attachments and managing versioning. If the link handling logic is not correctly implemented here, it could be a cause of the issue.

#### --- src/publish/confluence/api/index.ts ---
```
src/publish/confluence/api/index.ts
class: ConfluenceClient
```
The `ConfluenceClient` class provides methods to interact with the Confluence API. If the methods for creating or updating content do not correctly handle the link formatting, it could be a cause of the issue.

#### --- src/publish/confluence/api/types.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not include any functions or classes that directly handle the publishing process or link formatting.
