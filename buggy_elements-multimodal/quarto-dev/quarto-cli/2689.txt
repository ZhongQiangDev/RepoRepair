### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `crossref: false` setting in the `format` metadata is not being respected. Specifically, the cross-reference filter is still being applied even when `crossref: false` is specified, as indicated by the underlined `false` in the provided images.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `crossref: false` setting is being processed and applied within the rendering pipeline. The `crossrefFilterActive` function checks if the `crossref` property is explicitly set to `false` in the metadata. If it is not `false`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the cross-reference feature should be active. However, if the `crossref: false` setting is not being respected, it suggests that either:

1. The `crossref: false` setting is not being correctly read or passed to the `crossrefFilterActive` function.
2. The `crossrefFilterActive` function is not being called or its result is being ignored somewhere in the rendering process.
3. There might be other parts of the codebase that override or ignore the `crossref: false` setting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/command/render/crossref.ts`

This file contains functions directly related to cross-referencing, so it is highly relevant to the issue.

```
src/command/render/crossref.ts
function: crossrefFilterActive
function: crossrefFilterParams
```

- `crossrefFilterActive`: This function checks if the `crossref` property is `false` in the metadata. If this function is not being called or its result is being ignored, it could explain why `crossref: false` is not respected.
- `crossrefFilterParams`: This function processes and validates cross-reference related parameters. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could also contribute to the issue.

#### `src/command/render/pandoc.ts`

This file contains functions related to Pandoc rendering, which is likely where the cross-reference filter is applied.

```
src/command/render/pandoc.ts
function: runPandoc
function: resolveExtras
```

- `runPandoc`: This function is a comprehensive wrapper around the Pandoc document conversion tool. It handles various options and filters. If the `crossref: false` setting is not being respected, it could be due to how this function processes the options and filters.
- `resolveExtras`: This function resolves additional dependencies and configurations. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could also contribute to the issue.

#### `src/command/render/render-contexts.ts`

This file contains functions related to rendering contexts, which might be relevant if the `crossref: false` setting is not being correctly passed to the rendering process.

```
src/command/render/render-contexts.ts
function: renderContexts
function: resolveFormats
```

- `renderContexts`: This function prepares render contexts for a given file. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could contribute to the issue.
- `resolveFormats`: This function determines the appropriate formats for rendering a file. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could also contribute to the issue.

#### `src/command/render/render-files.ts`

This file contains functions related to rendering files, which might be relevant if the `crossref: false` setting is not being correctly applied during the rendering process.

```
src/command/render/render-files.ts
function: renderFiles
function: renderExecute
```

- `renderFiles`: This function is responsible for rendering a list of files into their respective output formats. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could contribute to the issue.
- `renderExecute`: This function handles the execution of computations during the rendering process. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could also contribute to the issue.

#### `src/config/format.ts`

This file contains functions related to checking and validating output formats, which might be relevant if the `crossref: false` setting is not being correctly validated.

```
src/config/format.ts
function: isHtmlCompatible
function: isPresentationOutput
```

- `isHtmlCompatible`: This function checks if the provided format is compatible with HTML output. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could contribute to the issue.
- `isPresentationOutput`: This function checks if the provided format represents a presentation output format. If it is not correctly handling the `crossref: false` setting, it could also contribute to the issue.
