### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that comments in the markdown text are not being properly ignored or hidden in the preview. Instead, they are being displayed as plain text in the rendered output. Specifically:

- The HTML comment `<!-- It's a comment -->` is not being hidden.
- The markdown-style comment `<!-- It's a comment too -->` is also not being hidden and is displayed as plain text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the markdown parser handles comments. In markdown, comments are typically ignored and should not appear in the final rendered output. However, the current implementation seems to be treating these comments as plain text instead of ignoring them.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/marked.esm.js ---
```
lib/marked.esm.js
function: html
function: inlineText
function: inlineTokens
```

- **html**: This function processes HTML blocks. It might be relevant if it's not properly handling HTML comments.
- **inlineText**: This function processes plain text and might be relevant if it's not ignoring comments.
- **inlineTokens**: This function processes inline tokens and might be relevant if it's not properly handling comments.

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
```
lib/marked.js
function: html
function: inlineText
function: inlineTokens
```

- **html**: Similar to the one in `lib/marked.esm.js`.
- **inlineText**: Similar to the one in `lib/marked.esm.js`.
- **inlineTokens**: Similar to the one in `lib/marked.esm.js`.

#### --- src/Lexer.js ---
```
src/Lexer.js
function: inline
function: inlineTokens
```

- **inline**: This function processes inline elements and might be relevant if it's not ignoring comments.
- **inlineTokens**: This function processes inline tokens and might be relevant if it's not properly handling comments.

#### --- src/marked.js ---
```
src/marked.js
function: inline
function: inlineTokens
```

- **inline**: Similar to the one in `src/Lexer.js`.
- **inlineTokens**: Similar to the one in `src/Lexer.js`.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `Tokenizer.js` file does not seem to have functions directly related to handling comments in the way described in the problem. The relevant functions are more likely to be found in the lexer and parser components.
