### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the red dots (representing a 'hover' effect) are always rendered below the selected feature, regardless of the zIndex setting. The user expects the red dots to appear above the selected feature when the custom SVG icon is selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the zIndex is managed or applied within the OpenLayers library. Specifically, the zIndex of the selected feature layer might be overriding or not properly considering the zIndex of the layer containing the red dots. This could be due to how the rendering order is determined or how the zIndex is applied during the rendering process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/interaction/Select.js ---
```
src/ol/interaction/Select.js
class: Select
```
The `Select` class manages the selection of features and applies styles to them. The issue might be related to how the `Select` interaction handles the zIndex of the selected features.

#### --- src/ol/layer/Base.js ---
```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
class: BaseLayer
```
The `BaseLayer` class manages common properties like zIndex. The issue might be related to how the zIndex is set or managed within the layer properties.

#### --- src/ol/layer/Layer.js ---
```
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
class: Layer
```
The `Layer` class manages the rendering of layers and could be relevant if the issue is related to how layers are rendered based on their zIndex.

#### --- src/ol/layer/Vector.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `VectorLayer` class is responsible for rendering vector data but does not directly manage zIndex or rendering order.

#### --- src/ol/renderer/vector.js ---
```
src/ol/renderer/vector.js
function: renderFeature
function: renderFeatureInternal
function: renderGeometry
```
The rendering functions in this file manage the actual drawing of features and geometries. The issue might be related to how these functions handle the zIndex during rendering.
