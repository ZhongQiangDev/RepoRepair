### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description suggests that the current implementation does not support an `auto` option for the `convertToRGB` parameter when dealing with GeoTIFF sources. Specifically, if a GeoTIFF source has 3 samples per pixel and a photometric interpretation like CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab, the `auto` setting should automatically use the `image.readRGB()` method to convert the data to RGB format. This functionality is currently missing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of logic in the GeoTIFF source handling that checks for the `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option and then applies the appropriate conversion method (`image.readRGB()`) based on the photometric interpretation and samples per pixel. The current implementation may not have this conditional logic or may not be correctly configured to handle these specific cases.

### Explanation

- **src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js**: This file contains the `GeoTIFFSource` class, which is responsible for handling GeoTIFF data sources. The `getImagesForSource` and `getImagesForTIFF` functions are involved in fetching and processing GeoTIFF images. The `composeTile_` method is responsible for combining data from multiple sources into a single tile, which may involve converting the data to RGB format. These functions and the class are likely where the logic for handling the `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option should be implemented.

- **Other Files**: The other files do not contain functions or classes directly related to the handling of GeoTIFF sources or the conversion of image data to RGB format. Therefore, they are not relevant to the issue described in the GitHub problem description.
