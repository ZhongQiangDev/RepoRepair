### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is the performance degradation of the `pointermove` event in version 6.4.0 compared to version 6.3.1. Specifically, the cursor change during interactions like zooming and panning is much slower in 6.4.0, which affects the overall responsiveness of the map.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the performance issue likely lies in changes made to the event handling or rendering mechanisms between versions 6.3.1 and 6.4.0. The `pointermove` event is responsible for updating the cursor style and potentially other visual feedback during interactions. If this event is processed more slowly or if additional processing steps have been added, it could lead to the observed lag.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- examples/custom-interactions.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/ol/events.js ---
```
src/ol/events.js
function: function_7
function: function_8
function: function_9
function: function_10
function: function_11
```

The functions `function_7` (`listen`), `function_8` (`listenOnce`), `function_9` (`unlisten`), `function_10` (`unlistenByKey`), and `function_11` (`unlistenAll`) are relevant because they manage event listeners. If there are issues with registering or unregistering `pointermove` events, these functions could be involved.

#### --- src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js ---
```
src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js
class: MapBrowserEventHandler
```

The `MapBrowserEventHandler` class is relevant because it manages various browser events on the map, including `pointermove`. If there are inefficiencies in how `pointermove` events are handled within this class, it could contribute to the performance issue.

#### --- src/ol/events/condition.js ---
```
src/ol/events/condition.js
function: function_6
```

The `function_6` (`pointerMove`) is relevant because it checks if an event is a `pointermove` event. If this function has changed or if there are additional conditions added, it could impact the performance of `pointermove` event handling.

#### --- src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js ---
```
src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js
class: DragPan
```

The `DragPan` class is relevant because it handles map panning interactions, which are affected by the performance issue. If there are inefficiencies in how `pointermove` events are processed within this class, it could contribute to the problem.

### Summary

The identified functions and classes are likely involved in the performance issue with `pointermove` events. Further investigation into these specific locations should help pinpoint the exact cause and potential solutions.
