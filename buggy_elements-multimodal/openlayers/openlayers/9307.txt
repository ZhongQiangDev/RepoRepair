### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is the presence of an unwanted gap between two lines of text in a label feature when using OpenLayers v4.6.4 and lower versions. This gap was not present in OpenLayers v2.13. The user wants to remove this gap to achieve a styling similar to the previous version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the unwanted gap between two lines of text likely stems from changes in how text is rendered or styled in OpenLayers v4.6.4 compared to v2.13. Specifically, the issue could be related to how line breaks (`\n`) are handled in the `ol.style.Text` class or how text is measured and rendered in the canvas rendering functions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/render/canvas.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
function: createTextChunks
class: Executor
```

The `createTextChunks` function is relevant because it handles the insertion of newline characters and empty strings into the text chunks. This could be where the unwanted gap is introduced.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
class: CanvasTextBuilder
```

The `CanvasTextBuilder` class is relevant because it handles the rendering of text on the canvas, including text placement and styling. The `drawText` method and `setTextStyle` method could be involved in the text rendering process.

#### `src/ol/style/Text.js`

```
src/ol/style/Text.js
class: Text
```

The `Text` class is relevant because it manages the text styling properties, including font, alignment, and other text properties. The `text_` attribute and related getter/setter methods could be involved in the text rendering process.
