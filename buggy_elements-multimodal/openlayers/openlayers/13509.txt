### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `WebGlTile` layer remains visible even after the visibility of its parent `Group` layer is set to `false`. This issue does not occur when using a `Tile` layer instead of a `WebGlTile` layer.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the visibility of layers is propagated down to the `WebGlTile` layer when its parent `Group` layer's visibility is changed. The `WebGlTile` layer might not be properly updating its visibility state in response to changes in its parent group's visibility. This could be due to a problem in the visibility propagation mechanism or in the rendering logic of the `WebGlTile` layer.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/PluggableMap.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/layer/Group.js
```
src/ol/layer/Group.js
class: LayerGroup
```
The `LayerGroup` class manages a collection of layers and is responsible for propagating visibility changes to its child layers. It is relevant to the issue.

#### src/ol/layer/Layer.js
```
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
function: inView
class: Layer
```
The `Layer` class contains the `inView` function, which checks if a layer is visible under the current view conditions. This function is relevant to the visibility logic of layers.

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
```
The `WebGLTileLayer` class is the specific layer type that is not behaving as expected. It is directly relevant to the issue.

#### src/ol/renderer/Layer.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/Layer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/Layer.js
class: WebGLLayerRenderer
```
The `WebGLLayerRenderer` class is responsible for rendering layers using WebGL. It may contain logic related to the rendering and visibility of WebGL-based layers.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```
The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class is the renderer for `WebGLTile` layers. It is directly responsible for rendering these layers and may contain the issue related to visibility handling.
