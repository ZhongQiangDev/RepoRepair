### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `setOpacity` function for the image of a feature style does not have any effect on the UI after updating to version 6.2.0. In version 6.1.1, the feature blinks (indicating that opacity changes are being applied), but in version 6.2.0, the feature does not blink, suggesting that the opacity changes are not being applied.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in how opacity is applied to the image style in version 6.2.0. The `setOpacity` function may not be correctly updating the opacity value, or the rendering process may not be correctly applying the updated opacity value to the image.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/css.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas.js
function: drawImageOrLabel
```

The `drawImageOrLabel` function is responsible for rendering images and labels on the canvas. If the opacity is not being applied correctly, this function might need to be inspected to ensure that the opacity value is being used properly when drawing the image.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
```

The `Icon` class manages the visual representation of icons, including their opacity. The issue might be related to how the `opacity` attribute is being set or used within this class.

#### `src/ol/style/Image.js`

```
src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
```

The `ImageStyle` class is an abstract base class for image styles and includes an `opacity_` attribute. The issue might be related to how this attribute is being set or used within this class.

#### `src/ol/style/Style.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
