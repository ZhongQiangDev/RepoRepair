### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the current implementation of the gutter option is only supported by `TileWMS`, and it does not handle the gutter correctly for WebGL tile layers. Specifically:

- The gutter option should be available for more tile sources like `XYZ` and `DataTile`.
- When rendering with WebGL, the gutter is removed before creating the texture, which does not prevent edge effects.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior can be attributed to the following:

- **Limited Support for Gutter Option**: The `TileWMS` class has a `gutter_` attribute and a `tileUrlFunction` that handles the gutter. However, other tile sources like `XYZ` and `DataTile` do not have similar support.
- **Incorrect Handling of Gutter in WebGL**: The `TileTexture` class in the WebGL context removes the gutter before creating the texture, which leads to edge effects. This indicates that the handling of the gutter needs to be revised to be consistent with how layer extents are handled.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js`
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
function: addTileTextureToLookup
function: depthForZ
function: getRenderExtent
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```
The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class and the `addTileTextureToLookup` function are relevant because they manage tile textures and rendering in WebGL. The `getRenderExtent` function is relevant as it deals with the extent of tiles, which is related to handling gutters.

#### `src/ol/source/DataTile.js`
```
src/ol/source/DataTile.js
class: DataTileSource
```
The `DataTileSource` class is relevant because it manages tile data and could be extended to support the gutter option.

#### `src/ol/source/TileImage.js`
```
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
function: defaultTileLoadFunction
class: TileImage
```
The `TileImage` class is relevant because it manages image tiles and could be extended to support the gutter option.

#### `src/ol/source/TileWMS.js`
```
src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
function: tileUrlFunction
class: TileWMS
```
The `TileWMS` class and the `tileUrlFunction` are relevant because they currently handle the gutter option, and their implementation can serve as a reference for extending support to other tile sources.

#### `src/ol/source/XYZ.js`
```
src/ol/source/XYZ.js
class: XYZ
```
The `XYZ` class is relevant because it manages tile data in the XYZ format and could be extended to support the gutter option.

#### `src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TileGrid` class manages tile grids but does not directly handle the gutter option or WebGL rendering.

#### `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js`
```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
function: bindAndConfigure
function: createPixelContext
function: uploadDataTexture
function: uploadImageTexture
class: TileTexture
```
The `TileTexture` class and the `uploadImageTexture` function are relevant because they handle the creation and uploading of textures in WebGL, where the current handling of the gutter needs to be revised. The `bindAndConfigure` function is also relevant as it configures texture parameters.
