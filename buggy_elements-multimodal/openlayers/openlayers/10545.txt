### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the label "Andy's Pub, Terrasse" is displayed as "Andy&amp;s Pub, Terrasse" on the map. This indicates that the HTML entity `&amp;` is not being properly decoded to `&` before being rendered as a label.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the fact that the text content is being read from an XML file (KML in this case) and the HTML entities within the text content are not being decoded before being used to create the label. The `&amp;` entity is being treated as literal text rather than being converted to `&`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/xml.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/format/KML.js`

```
src/ol/format/KML.js
function: createNameStyleFunction
function: readName
function: readStyleURL
```

- `createNameStyleFunction`: This function creates a text style for a name. It could be relevant if it is responsible for setting the text content of the label.
- `readName`: This function reads the name from a KML node. It could be relevant if it is not properly decoding HTML entities.
- `readStyleURL`: This function reads a style URL from a KML node. It is less likely to be directly relevant to the issue but could be involved if the style URL affects the text content.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/style/Text.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary

The most relevant functions are located in `src/ol/format/KML.js`. Specifically, `createNameStyleFunction`, `readName`, and `readStyleURL` should be inspected to ensure that HTML entities are properly decoded before being used to create the label text.
