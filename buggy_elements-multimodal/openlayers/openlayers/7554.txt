### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is the **low performance of the draw interaction** when using `ol.layer.Image` with `renderMode: 'image'` in OpenLayers version 4.6.2 compared to the performance in version 4.4.2. Specifically, the user notes that rendering a triangle is significantly slower in the newer version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the performance issue is likely related to changes in how `ol.layer.Image` with `renderMode: 'image'` handles rendering in OpenLayers 4.6.2. The deprecation of `ol.source.ImageVector` suggests that the rendering pipeline has been altered, potentially introducing inefficiencies or additional processing steps that were not present in version 4.4.2. The performance degradation could be due to:

- Changes in how features are rendered onto the canvas.
- Additional overhead in the rendering pipeline.
- Inefficient handling of the `renderMode: 'image'` configuration.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/immediate.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/replay.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/replay.js
function: function_13
function: function_14
function: function_15
function: function_17
function: function_19
```

These functions are part of the canvas rendering pipeline and could be relevant to the performance issue. `function_13` processes rendering instructions, `function_14` and `function_15` handle replaying instructions, and `function_17` and `function_19` configure fill and stroke styles, which could impact rendering performance.

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js`

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js
function: function_5
function: function_10
function: function_13
```

These functions are involved in rendering vector layers onto a canvas. `function_5` (`composeFrame`) handles the core rendering process, `function_10` prepares the frame for rendering, and `function_13` (`renderFeature`) renders individual features, all of which could contribute to the performance issue.

#### `src/ol/source/imagevector.js`

```
src/ol/source/imagevector.js
function: function_2
function: function_12
function: function_13
```

These functions are related to the deprecated `ol.source.ImageVector` class. `function_2` handles the rendering process, `function_12` (`renderFeature_`) renders individual features, and `function_13` (`setStyle`) configures feature styles. Although the class is deprecated, understanding its behavior could provide insights into the performance differences.

### Summary

The performance issue is likely related to changes in the rendering pipeline for `ol.layer.Image` with `renderMode: 'image'` in OpenLayers 4.6.2. The relevant functions and classes identified above should be inspected and potentially optimized to address the performance degradation.
