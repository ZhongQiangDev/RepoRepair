### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that when the map projection crosses the dateline (180Â° longitude), the graticule lines (meridians and parallels) do not display correctly. Specifically:
- Most meridians do not appear.
- Parallels begin at the dateline and/or extend too far.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the graticule lines are generated and rendered when the map projection spans the dateline. The dateline introduces a discontinuity in the coordinate system, which can cause problems if not handled correctly. Specifically:
- **Meridians**: When the map crosses the dateline, the meridians may not be correctly wrapped or adjusted, leading to their absence.
- **Parallels**: Parallels may start or end at the dateline instead of wrapping around the globe, causing them to appear incorrectly.
