### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `getData` method is called on a GeoTIFF source with a no-data value set to `NaN`, it returns `[NaN, NaN, NaN, 255]` instead of `[NaN, NaN, NaN, 0]`. This indicates that the alpha channel is not being correctly set to `0` for pixels with a no-data value of `NaN`, which is expected for transparency.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the no-data value `NaN` is being handled during the loading and processing of the GeoTIFF data. Specifically, the problem could be in the following areas:
- The `GeoTIFFSource` class might not be correctly interpreting the `NaN` value as a no-data value.
- The `loadTile_` method in `GeoTIFFSource` might not be setting the alpha channel to `0` for pixels with a no-data value.
- The `getData` method might not be correctly returning the expected pixel values with the alpha channel set to `0`.

### Explanation

#### src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
- **GeoTIFFSource**: This class is responsible for handling GeoTIFF data and managing the sources. It is likely involved in the configuration and loading of the GeoTIFF data, including handling no-data values.
- **loadTile_**: This function fetches and processes pixel data for a specific tile. It should handle no-data values and set the alpha channel appropriately.
- **getData**: This method returns the loaded tile data and should ensure that the alpha channel is correctly set for no-data values.
- **configure_**: This method processes the loaded GeoTIFF images and sets up the tile grid. It might need to ensure that no-data values are correctly handled.
- **getImagesForSource**: This function fetches GeoTIFF images for a given source and might need to handle no-data values during the image loading process.

#### src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
- **uploadDataTexture**: This function uploads pixel data to a WebGL texture. It should ensure that the data is correctly formatted, including handling no-data values and alpha channels.
- **getPixelData**: This method retrieves pixel data from the tile and should ensure that the alpha channel is correctly set for no-data values.
