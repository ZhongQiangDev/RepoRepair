### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the raster reprojection in OpenLayers assumes that the projected pixels are square, leading to misalignment when the source pixels cover non-square areas in their original projection. Specifically, the horizontal alignment is incorrect, causing the projected image to appear stretched or distorted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the assumption in the reprojection algorithm that pixels should remain square in the target projection. This assumption does not account for the fact that the source pixels may cover non-square areas in their original projection. As a result, the reprojection process does not preserve the original pixel dimensions, leading to misalignment and distortion.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/reproj.js`

This file contains several functions that are directly involved in the reprojection process. The functions `calculateSourceExtentResolution`, `calculateSourceResolution`, and `render` are particularly relevant because they handle the calculation of resolutions and the actual rendering of the reprojected image.

```
src/ol/reproj.js
function: calculateSourceExtentResolution
function: calculateSourceResolution
function: render
```

#### `src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js`

This file contains the `ReprojDataTile` class, which is responsible for handling the reprojection of tile data. While it does not directly cause the issue, it interacts with the reprojection functions and may need to be adjusted if changes are made to the reprojection process.

```
src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js
class: ReprojDataTile
```

#### `src/ol/reproj/Image.js`

This file contains the `ReprojImage` class, which handles the reprojection of images. The `reproject_` method in this class is responsible for performing the actual reprojection, making it relevant to the issue.

```
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
class: ReprojImage
```

#### `src/ol/reproj/Tile.js`

This file contains the `ReprojTile` class, which manages the reprojection of tiles. Similar to `ReprojDataTile`, it interacts with the reprojection functions and may need adjustments.

```
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
class: ReprojTile
```

#### `src/ol/reproj/Triangulation.js`

This file contains the `Triangulation` class, which is used for triangulation during the reprojection process. While it does not directly cause the issue, it is involved in the reprojection calculations and may need to be adjusted.

```
src/ol/reproj/Triangulation.js
class: Triangulation
```
