### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using an even number of bands (â‰¥ 6) in `DataTileSource` and setting the last band as an alpha channel, the alpha mask does not work correctly. This results in incorrect output visualization when the layer style is set to show RGBA.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `DataTileSource` handles the band count and the alpha channel. When the band count is even and greater than or equal to 6, the alpha channel is not being processed correctly, leading to incorrect transparency in the visualization. This could be due to incorrect assumptions about the band count or improper handling of the alpha channel in the data processing pipeline.
