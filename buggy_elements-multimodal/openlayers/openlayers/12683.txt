### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using an icon style with a custom color and an offset, the offset is incorrect when the screen pixel ratio is not equal to 1. Specifically, the offset appears to be scaled incorrectly, leading to the icon being positioned incorrectly on the screen.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the offset is calculated and applied when the screen pixel ratio is greater than 1. The offset is likely being scaled improperly, causing the icon to be rendered in the wrong position. This could be due to a miscalculation in the scaling factor or an incorrect application of the pixel ratio when determining the final position of the icon.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/colorlike.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/ImageBuilder.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/ImageBuilder.js
class: CanvasImageBuilder
```

The `CanvasImageBuilder` class is responsible for rendering images on a canvas. The issue might be related to how the image is scaled and positioned based on the pixel ratio. The `pixelRatio` attribute and the methods that use it, such as `drawPoint` and `drawMultiPoint`, could be relevant.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
function: calculateScale
```

The `Icon` class manages the properties of the icon, including its offset and size. The `calculateScale` function might be involved in calculating the scaling factor, which could be affected by the pixel ratio.

#### `src/ol/style/IconImage.js`

```
src/ol/style/IconImage.js
class: IconImage
function: get
```

The `IconImage` class handles the image element and its properties. The `get` function retrieves an `IconImage` object from the cache, which might be relevant if the issue is related to how the image is cached and retrieved.

#### `src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
