### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `drawFeature()` function does not work correctly with geographic coordinates unless Null Island (0,0) is within the map view. When the map is panned so that Null Island is out of view, the animation of the marker on the polyline stops being visible. However, if `drawFeature()` is replaced with `setStyle()` and `drawGeometry()`, the animation continues to be visible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from an incorrect extent comparison within the `drawFeature()` function. The extent comparison might be checking if the feature's extent intersects with the current view extent, and if Null Island is not in view, the feature's extent might not be considered as intersecting with the view extent. This could be due to an incorrect or redundant extent comparison logic.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/extent.js

This file contains functions related to extent calculations and comparisons, which are likely relevant to the issue described.

```
src/ol/extent.js
function: intersects
function: containsExtent
function: containsCoordinate
function: coordinateRelationship
```

These functions are used to check if extents intersect or if coordinates are within an extent. If the issue is related to an incorrect extent comparison, these functions could be involved.

#### src/ol/render/VectorContext.js

This file contains the `VectorContext` class, which includes the `drawFeature()` method. This method is directly related to the issue described.

```
src/ol/render/VectorContext.js
class: VectorContext
```

#### src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js

This file contains functions related to hit detection, which are not directly related to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js

This file contains the `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class, which handles immediate rendering of vector data. While it does not directly handle the `drawFeature()` method, it is related to rendering.

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
class: CanvasImmediateRenderer
```

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/VectorLayer.js

This file contains the `WebGLVectorLayerRenderer` class, which is related to WebGL rendering of vector layers. It is not directly related to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/VectorTileLayer.js

This file contains the `WebGLVectorTileLayerRenderer` class, which is related to WebGL rendering of vector tile layers. It is not directly related to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/webgl/Helper.js

This file contains functions and classes related to WebGL helper utilities, which are not directly related to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/webgl/TileGeometry.js

This file contains the `TileGeometry` class, which is related to tile geometry data for rendering. It is not directly related to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant files and functions/classes are:

```
src/ol/extent.js
function: intersects
function: containsExtent
function: containsCoordinate
function: coordinateRelationship

src/ol/render/VectorContext.js
class: VectorContext
```
