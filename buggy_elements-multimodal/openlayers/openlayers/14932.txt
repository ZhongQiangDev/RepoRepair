### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the texts 'Small text' and 'negative offsetX' are not aligned correctly when the `textAlign` property is set to `'start'` or `'end'`. Specifically, these texts are aligned at the wrong end, indicating a regression in the handling of these alignment values.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `textAlign` property is interpreted and applied when it is set to `'start'` or `'end'`. The `horizontalTextAlign` function in `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js` is responsible for converting `'start'` and `'end'` to `'left'` or `'right'` based on the text direction. If this conversion is not working correctly, it could lead to the observed misalignment.
