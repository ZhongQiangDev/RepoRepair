### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the WebGLTile layer renderer does not clip the image gutter before creating textures. This results in misplacement and duplication of tiles when using the WebGLTile layer renderer with a TileWMS source that has a gutter option.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the WebGLTile layer renderer handles tile textures. Specifically, it seems that the renderer does not account for the gutter size when creating textures from the tile images. This means that the gutter, which is an additional border around the tile, is not being clipped out before the texture is created, leading to misplacement and duplication of tiles.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/layer/BaseTile.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
```

The `WebGLTileLayer` class is relevant because it is responsible for rendering tile layers using WebGL. The issue likely involves how this class handles the creation of textures from tile images.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```

The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class is relevant because it is responsible for the actual WebGL rendering of tile layers. The issue likely involves how this class handles the creation and management of tile textures.

#### src/ol/source/TileImage.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
```
src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
class: TileWMS
```

The `TileWMS` class is relevant because it is responsible for handling tile data from WMS servers. The issue may involve how this class handles the gutter size when constructing URLs for tile requests.

#### src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
```
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
class: TileTexture
function: uploadImageTexture
```

The `TileTexture` class and the `uploadImageTexture` function are relevant because they handle the creation and uploading of textures from tile images. The issue likely involves how these functions handle the clipping of the gutter before creating textures.
