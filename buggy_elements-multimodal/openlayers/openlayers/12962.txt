### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after updating to OpenLayers (OL) version 6.9.0, the opacity of independent layers (specifically tiled ArcGIS REST layers) is not stacking correctly. Instead of each layer's opacity being applied independently, the top-most layer appears opaque relative to other OL layers, even though it allows basemaps to display through. This issue seems to be introduced in version 6.8.1 and later, as versions 6.7.0 and below render the layers as expected. Additionally, if the opacity values for individual layers are not identical, the layers render correctly with transparency.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the opacity of layers is being applied during the rendering process. Specifically, the problem may be related to how the opacity values are being combined or applied when multiple layers with the same opacity value are rendered. The issue could be due to a change in the rendering logic or how the canvas context is being manipulated when drawing the layers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/layer/Base.js`
This file contains the `BaseLayer` class, which manages common properties and methods for layers, including opacity. Since the issue is related to layer opacity, this class is relevant.

```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
class: BaseLayer
```

#### `src/ol/renderer/Map.js`
This file contains the `MapRenderer` class and the `sortByZIndex` function. The `sortByZIndex` function is used to sort layers based on their zIndex, which is related to layer stacking. However, the issue described is more about opacity stacking rather than layer order. The `MapRenderer` class manages the rendering of the map, but it does not directly handle layer opacity.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js`
This file contains the `CanvasImageLayerRenderer` class, which is responsible for rendering image layers onto a canvas. Since the issue involves tiled ArcGIS REST layers, which are likely rendered as image layers, this class is relevant.

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js
class: CanvasImageLayerRenderer
```

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/Layer.js`
This file contains the `CanvasLayerRenderer` class, which is an abstract class for canvas-based rendering of layers. This class manages the rendering container, coordinate transformations, and pixel data retrieval. Since it handles the rendering process, it is relevant to the issue.

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/Layer.js
class: CanvasLayerRenderer
```

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js`
This file contains the `CanvasTileLayerRenderer` class, which specializes in rendering tile layers on a canvas. Since the issue involves tiled ArcGIS REST layers, this class is relevant.

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js
class: CanvasTileLayerRenderer
```
