### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the point symbols in the KML layer are not being displayed correctly when rendered in OpenLayers. Specifically:

- The symbols appear to be anchored at the center-bottom instead of the center.
- The symbols are displayed at a larger size compared to how they are shown in Google Earth.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior likely lies in how the KML symbols are being parsed and rendered in OpenLayers. The anchor point and size of the symbols are not being correctly interpreted or applied during the rendering process. This could be due to:

- Incorrect parsing of the KML symbol properties (e.g., anchor point, size).
- Incorrect application of the parsed properties when creating the OpenLayers styles.
- Default values being used instead of the values specified in the KML.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `examples/drag-and-drop-custom-kmz.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/format/KML.js`

```
src/ol/format/KML.js
function: iconStyleParser
function: createFeatureStyleFunction
function: createNameStyleFunction
function: createStyleDefaults
function: writeIconStyle
```

These functions are relevant because they handle the parsing and creation of styles for KML icons, which directly affects the symbol appearance.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
function: calculateScale
```

The `Icon` class and `calculateScale` function are relevant because they define the visual representation of icons and handle scaling, which affects the size of the symbols.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
class: CanvasImmediateRenderer
```

The `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class is relevant because it handles the actual rendering of the symbols on the canvas, including applying styles and transformations.

#### `src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
