### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is the **splitting of rendering tests** across two different locations: `rendering` and `test/rendering`. This split leads to inconsistency and redundancy in the testing approach, making it harder to maintain and manage the tests.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to historical development practices where different parts of the codebase were developed independently, leading to the creation of separate testing directories. This separation has resulted in duplicated effort and a lack of a unified testing strategy. To resolve this, the tests need to be consolidated into a single, coherent structure.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- examples/webpack/example-builder.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- rendering/webpack.config.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- rendering/cases/stacking/main.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/source/TileImage.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/source/Vector.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/style/Style.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/webgl/Helper.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/webgl/PostProcessingPass.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the issue of split rendering tests. The problem described in the GitHub issue pertains to the organization and structure of the test files themselves rather than the functionality of the code within these specific files. To address the issue, the focus should be on restructuring the test files and consolidating them into a single directory or approach, rather than modifying the functions and classes listed in the provided files.
