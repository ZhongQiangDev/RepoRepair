### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the raster source creates web workers using `pixelworks`, but these workers are never terminated. This leads to high memory usage and potential memory leaks, as multiple workers remain active even when they are no longer needed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the lack of proper termination of web workers after they have completed their tasks. In the provided code snippets, there is a workaround that manually terminates the workers by accessing the `rasterWorkers` array and calling `terminate()` on each worker. This suggests that the `RasterSource` class or related functions are not properly managing the lifecycle of the workers, leading to them not being terminated automatically.

```

The `RasterSource` class is likely responsible for managing the raster operations and the associated web workers. The `createWorker` and `createFauxWorker` functions are involved in creating the workers, and `getImageData` and `newImageData` may be related to the processing of image data that the workers handle.
