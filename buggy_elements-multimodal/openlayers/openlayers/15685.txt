### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using `setFill()` in the style of an `ol.layer.VectorTile`, an additional semi-transparent layer appears on top of the other layers. This additional layer is not expected and causes issues such as flickering on mouse hover.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the `fill` property is being applied to the `VectorTile` layer. The `setFill()` method might be causing the renderer to create an additional layer or apply the fill in a way that results in an unintended semi-transparent overlay. This could be due to a bug in the rendering logic or an incorrect handling of the fill style in the `VectorTile` layer.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
```
src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
class: VectorTileLayer
```
The `VectorTileLayer` class is directly involved in creating and managing the `VectorTile` layer. The issue might be related to how the `style` property is applied or how the layer handles rendering modes.

#### src/ol/render/Feature.js
```
src/ol/render/Feature.js
class: RenderFeature
function: toFeature
function: toGeometry
```
The `RenderFeature` class and related functions are responsible for converting and rendering features. The issue might be related to how the fill style is applied to the rendered features.

#### src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
```
src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
class: ExecutorGroup
```
The `ExecutorGroup` class manages the execution of rendering instructions. The issue might be related to how the fill style is handled during the rendering process.

#### src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
```
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
class: CanvasImmediateRenderer
```
The `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class handles immediate rendering of vector data. The issue might be related to how the fill style is applied during the rendering of geometries.

#### src/ol/render/canvas/PolygonBuilder.js
```
src/ol/render/canvas/PolygonBuilder.js
class: CanvasPolygonBuilder
```
The `CanvasPolygonBuilder` class handles the rendering of polygon-based geometries. The issue might be related to how the fill style is applied during the rendering of polygons.

#### src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js
class: CanvasVectorTileLayerRenderer
```
The `CanvasVectorTileLayerRenderer` class manages the rendering process for vector tile layers. The issue might be related to how the fill style is handled during the rendering of vector tiles.

#### src/ol/style/Style.js
```
src/ol/style/Style.js
class: Style
function: toFunction
```
The `Style` class and related functions are responsible for defining and applying styles. The issue might be related to how the fill style is created and applied.
