### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `className` setting in `ol.layer.Heatmap` does not work as expected. Specifically, when a custom `className` is set for the heatmap layer, it does not appear on the page, and the default `className` is not displayed either.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `className` is being handled within the `Heatmap` layer. The `className` property is supposed to be used to apply a custom CSS class to the layer's DOM element, but it seems that this property is either not being applied correctly or is being overridden somewhere in the rendering process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/Map.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/layer/Base.js`

```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
class: BaseLayer
```

The `BaseLayer` class is the foundation for all layer types and includes the `className_` attribute, which stores the CSS class name of the layer. This class is relevant because it sets up the basic structure for handling layer properties, including `className`.

#### `src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js`

```
src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
class: Heatmap
```

The `Heatmap` class extends `VectorLayer` and is responsible for rendering vector data as a heatmap. It is directly related to the issue since it is the specific layer type where the `className` setting is not working.

#### `src/ol/layer/Layer.js`

```
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
class: Layer
```

The `Layer` class is a fundamental component that manages the visual representation of map data. It inherits from `BaseLayer` and provides methods for rendering and managing layers. This class is relevant because it handles the general layer properties and rendering, which could affect how the `className` is applied.

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorTileLayer.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `src/ol/layer/Base.js`
   - `class: BaseLayer`

2. `src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js`
   - `class: Heatmap`

3. `src/ol/layer/Layer.js`
   - `class: Layer`

These locations are relevant because they are directly involved in the handling and rendering of layer properties, including the `className` attribute. The issue likely lies in how these classes interact with each other and manage the `className` property during the rendering process.
