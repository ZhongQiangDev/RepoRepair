### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description outlines the need to add expressive List and Button components to the Carbon design system. The wrong behavior involves the current Carbon components not meeting the requirements for productive experiences on various IBM.com pages. Specifically:

- The current list component uses a 14px type size and compact components, which are not suitable for the new requirements.
- The current button component does not have the desired 16px button label and 48px button height.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the existing Carbon components are designed for a different use case (long-form reading and marketing intent) and do not align with the new requirements for productive experiences. This mismatch necessitates the addition of new expressive components with the specified type sizes and dimensions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/themes/src/tokens.js`

This file contains the `formatTokenName` function, which formats token names for CSS/SCSS usage. While this function is relevant to the overall theme and token management, it does not directly address the addition of new expressive List and Button components. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js`

This file contains the `buildThemesFile` function, which generates theme maps for different themes. This function is relevant because it will need to incorporate the new expressive tokens and components into the theme maps. Therefore:

```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
function: buildThemesFile
```

#### `packages/type/src/scale.js`

This file contains the `getTypeSize` function, which calculates type sizes based on a recursive pattern. This function is relevant because it will need to be updated or utilized to ensure the new expressive List component uses the correct type size (16px with a 24px line height). Therefore:

```
packages/type/src/scale.js
function: getTypeSize
```
