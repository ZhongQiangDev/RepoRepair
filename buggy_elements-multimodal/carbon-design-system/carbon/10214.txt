### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `TableHeader` component is not correctly spreading the `...rest` props on the `<th>` element for sortable columns. Instead, the `...rest` props are being spread on the inner `<button>` element, which means that attributes like `id` are not being applied to the `<th>` as intended.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is a misplaced `...rest` prop in the `TableHeader` component's JSX. For non-sortable columns, the `...rest` props are correctly spread on the `<th>` element. However, for sortable columns, the `...rest` props are spread on the inner `<button>` element instead of the `<th>` element. This results in attributes like `id` being applied to the `<button>` instead of the `<th>`, which is not the desired behavior.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
function: TableHeader
```

The `TableHeader` function is relevant because it is the component where the issue occurs. Specifically, the `...rest` props are being spread on the wrong element for sortable columns.

### Suggested Fix

To fix the issue, the `...rest` props should be spread on the `<th>` element for both non-sortable and sortable columns. The relevant code snippet should be modified as follows:

```jsx
return (
  <th
    aria-sort={ariaSort}
    className={headerClassName}
    colSpan={colSpan}
    ref={ref}
    scope={scope}
    {...rest} // Move ...rest here for sortable columns
  >
    <div style={{ display: 'none' }} id={uniqueId}>
      {sortDescription}
    </div>
    <button
      type="button"
      aria-describedby={uniqueId}
      className={className}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      <span className={`${prefix}--table-sort__flow`}>
        <div className={`${prefix}--table-header-label`}>{children}</div>
        <Arrow className={`${prefix}--table-sort__icon`} />
        <Arrows className={`${prefix}--table-sort__icon-unsorted`} />
      </span>
    </button>
  </th>
);
```

This change ensures that the `...rest` props are correctly applied to the `<th>` element for both non-sortable and sortable columns, addressing the A11y issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
