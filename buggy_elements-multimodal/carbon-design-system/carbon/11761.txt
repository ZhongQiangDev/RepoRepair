### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `TableContainer` component does not define unique IDs for its `title` and `description` nodes. This prevents the `DataTable` from referencing these nodes using `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attributes, which are necessary for proper accessibility. As a result, screen readers like JAWS cannot correctly label or describe the table, leading to a poor user experience for those relying on assistive technologies.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the lack of unique IDs for the `title` and `description` nodes within the `TableContainer` component. Without these IDs, there is no way to associate the `title` and `description` with the `DataTable` using ARIA attributes. This results in the screen reader either using the table's rows to label it or requiring the use of `aria-label`, which is not the recommended approach according to ARIA guidelines.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `TableContainer.js` is responsible for rendering the `TableContainer` component. It needs to be modified to generate unique IDs for the `title` and `description` nodes and pass these IDs to the `DataTable` component for use with `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`.

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/useId.js ---
```
packages/react/src/internal/useId.js
function: useId
```

The `useId` function can be used to generate unique IDs for the `title` and `description` nodes within the `TableContainer` component. This function should be utilized to ensure that each `title` and `description` has a unique ID.

#### --- packages/react/src/tools/setupGetInstanceId.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/tools/uniqueId.js ---
```
packages/react/src/tools/uniqueId.js
function: uniqueId
```

The `uniqueId` function can also be used to generate unique IDs for the `title` and `description` nodes. However, since `useId` from `useId.js` is a React hook and more suitable for this context, `uniqueId` is less relevant but still a potential alternative.
