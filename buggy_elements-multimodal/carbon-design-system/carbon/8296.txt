### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors described in the GitHub problem are:

1. **SideNav does not close when a SideNavLink is clicked**: When a user clicks on a SideNavLink, the content loads into the content area, but the SideNav remains expanded instead of closing as expected.
2. **SideNav does not close when clicking outside of it**: The user must click the HeaderMenuButton to close the SideNav. Clicking on the overlay or the menu bar does not close the SideNav as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these behaviors likely lies in the lack of event handlers that would close the SideNav when a SideNavLink is clicked or when clicking outside the SideNav. Specifically:

- **SideNav does not close on SideNavLink click**: The SideNavLink component does not have a mechanism to notify the SideNav to close when it is clicked.
- **SideNav does not close when clicking outside**: There is no event listener set up to detect clicks outside the SideNav and close it accordingly.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `HeaderContainer.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
function: function_1
```
- **Relevance**: The `function_1` (HeaderContainer) manages the expanded state of the SideNav. It provides the `onClickSideNavExpand` handler to toggle the SideNav state. However, it does not handle closing the SideNav when a SideNavLink is clicked or when clicking outside the SideNav.

#### `HeaderMenuButton.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenuButton.js
function: function_1
```
- **Relevance**: The `function_1` (HeaderMenuButton) is responsible for toggling the SideNav state when the button is clicked. It does not handle closing the SideNav when a SideNavLink is clicked or when clicking outside the SideNav.

#### `HeaderNavigation.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- **Relevance**: The `HeaderNavigation` class is related to the navigation bar but does not directly manage the SideNav's expanded state or closing behavior.

#### `SideNav.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
function: SideNav
```
- **Relevance**: The `SideNav` function manages the expanded state of the SideNav. It has the `handleToggle` function to toggle the expanded state. However, it does not handle closing the SideNav when a SideNavLink is clicked or when clicking outside the SideNav.

#### `SideNavLink.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavLink.js
function: SideNavLink
```
- **Relevance**: The `SideNavLink` function renders the navigation links. It does not currently have a mechanism to notify the SideNav to close when it is clicked. Adding an `onClick` handler that calls the `handleToggle` function from `SideNav` could solve the first issue.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
function: function_1

packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenuButton.js
function: function_1

packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
function: SideNav

packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavLink.js
function: SideNavLink
```

These functions need to be inspected and potentially modified to include the necessary event handlers to close the SideNav when a SideNavLink is clicked or when clicking outside the SideNav.
