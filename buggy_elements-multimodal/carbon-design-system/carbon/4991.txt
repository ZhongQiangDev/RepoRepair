### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves accessibility violations when using the React MultiSelect component with an initial selected item. Specifically:

- The X button used to clear the selection is missing a label, causing a DAP violation.
- When the MultiSelect is expanded, there are multiple DAP violations related to grouping roles or elements, interactive elements without accessible names, and WAI-ARIA widgets with IMG roles missing nonempty alternate text or labels.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The causes of these issues likely stem from:

- Missing or incorrect ARIA attributes and labels for the X button and other interactive elements.
- Lack of proper grouping of related form controls, such as checkboxes and their labels.
- Missing or incorrect alternative text for SVG elements used as icons.
