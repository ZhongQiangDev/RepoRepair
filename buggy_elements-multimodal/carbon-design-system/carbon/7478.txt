### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `CodeSnippet` component does not have a disabled state. This means that when the value within the `CodeSnippet` is not yet available, the component should visually indicate that it is disabled and should not be interactable (e.g., no keyboard focus, no copy functionality).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `CodeSnippet` component currently lacks a `disabled` attribute or prop that would allow it to be styled and behave as disabled. Without this attribute, the component cannot visually or functionally represent a disabled state, leading to potential confusion for users who might attempt to interact with it when it is not ready.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
function: CodeSnippet
```

The `CodeSnippet` function is the main component that needs to be updated to include a `disabled` prop. This prop would control the styling and behavior of the component when it is in a disabled state.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Copy/Copy.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Copy/Copy.js
function: Copy
```

The `Copy` function is used within the `CodeSnippet` component to handle the copy functionality. If the `CodeSnippet` is disabled, the `Copy` component should also be disabled to prevent copying. Therefore, the `Copy` function needs to be updated to accept a `disabled` prop and handle it appropriately.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/CopyButton/CopyButton.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/CopyButton/CopyButton.js
function: CopyButton
```

The `CopyButton` function is used within the `Copy` component. If the `Copy` component is disabled, the `CopyButton` should also be disabled. Therefore, the `CopyButton` function needs to be updated to accept a `disabled` prop and handle it appropriately.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
