### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the GitHub problem description is that the `FileUploaderDropContainer` component generates a DOM structure that includes an `<input>` element nested inside a `<div>` with the `role="button"`. This violates the WCAG 2.1 checkpoint 4.1.2, which prohibits nested interactive controls because they are not properly announced by screen readers and can cause accessibility issues.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the way the `FileUploaderDropContainer` component is structured. Specifically, the `<input>` element is placed inside a `<div>` that has the `role="button"`. This structure violates the accessibility rule because the `<input>` is a focusable descendant of an element with a button role, which is not allowed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader-story.js ---

#### --- packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderDropContainer.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderDropContainer.js
function: FileUploaderDropContainer
```

The `FileUploaderDropContainer` function is directly responsible for rendering the problematic DOM structure. It needs to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that the `<input>` element is not nested inside an element with `role="button"`.
