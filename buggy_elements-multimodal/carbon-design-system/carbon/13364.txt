### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves inconsistency in the naming of the `ariaLabel` prop across different Carbon components. Some components accept `ariaLabel` (camelCase), while others accept `aria-label` (kebab-case). This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential accessibility issues, as the React documentation recommends using kebab-case for ARIA attributes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this inconsistency is likely due to historical reasons where different components were developed or updated at different times, leading to variations in prop naming conventions. Additionally, the React documentation explicitly recommends using kebab-case for ARIA attributes, which some components adhere to while others do not.
