### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that a long single line of text (CRN) in a code snippet does not wrap to multiple lines when using the `type="multi"` option. The user also mentions that setting the height does not help, and they need a way to add text wrapping so that the text can break into multiple lines. Additionally, they request a bonus feature to either set a maximum size or report the number of columns displayed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely related to the CSS styling of the `CodeSnippet` component. When `type="multi"` is used, the component is expected to handle multi-line code snippets, but it seems that the CSS does not include text wrapping properties like `white-space: pre-wrap` or `word-wrap: break-word`. This results in the text not breaking into multiple lines as expected.

### Explanation

- **`function_2` in `CodeSnippet-story.js`**: This function uses the `CodeSnippet` component with `type="multi"`. It is relevant because it demonstrates the use case where the text wrapping issue occurs. The function itself does not need changes, but it helps identify the problem.

- **`CodeSnippet` in `CodeSnippet.js`**: This is the main component responsible for rendering code snippets. The issue likely lies in the CSS styling applied to the `CodeSnippet` component when `type="multi"`. The component needs to be inspected and modified to include text wrapping properties in its CSS. Additionally, the bonus feature request can be implemented here by adding logic to either set a maximum size or report the number of columns displayed.
