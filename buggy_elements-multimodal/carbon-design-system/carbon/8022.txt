### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user clicks on an icon-only button, its tooltip becomes visible. If the user then hovers over another icon-only button, the tooltip for the second button also becomes visible, resulting in two tooltips being displayed simultaneously and overlapping each other. This is not the expected behavior, as only one tooltip should be visible at a time.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from the tooltip visibility logic. When a button is focused (either by clicking or using the Tab key), its tooltip is displayed. When the user hovers over another button, its tooltip is also displayed without hiding the previously focused button's tooltip. This suggests that the tooltip visibility state is not being properly managed when the focus or hover state changes between buttons.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/components/src/components/tooltip/tooltip.js ---
This file contains the `Tooltip` class, which manages the tooltip's visibility and positioning. The `_handleClick` method handles click and focus events, and the `_hookOn` method attaches event handlers for focusin, blur, touchleave, and touchcancel events. These methods are relevant to the issue because they control the tooltip's visibility based on user interactions.

```
packages/components/src/components/tooltip/tooltip.js
class: Tooltip
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js ---
This file contains the `Button` component, which is used to create the icon-only buttons. The `Button` component itself does not directly manage tooltips, but it is responsible for rendering the buttons that trigger the tooltips. Therefore, it is indirectly related to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js ---
This file contains the `Tooltip` component, which is the React version of the tooltip. The `Tooltip` class manages the tooltip's visibility and positioning, similar to the `Tooltip` class in the `packages/components/src/components/tooltip/tooltip.js` file. The `handleHover` method manages the tooltip's visibility based on hover events, and the `handleClickOutside` method ensures the tooltip closes when clicking outside of it. These methods are relevant to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
class: Tooltip
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TooltipIcon/TooltipIcon.js ---
This file contains the `TooltipIcon` component, which is a reusable component for displaying tooltips when interacting with an icon or button. The `TooltipIcon` component is directly related to the issue because it is responsible for rendering the icon-only buttons with tooltips.

```
packages/react/src/components/TooltipIcon/TooltipIcon.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- Other Files ---
The other files mentioned in the 'Relevant Files Information' do not contain functions or classes directly related to the issue.
