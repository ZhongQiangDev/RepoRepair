### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when destructuring the `DataTable` components from `@carbon/react`, the application breaks with console errors. However, when importing all the components directly from `@carbon/react`, the application works as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely related to how the `DataTable` components are exported and imported. When destructuring from `DataTable`, it seems that the components are not being correctly recognized or are not properly exported, leading to the application breaking. This suggests a problem with the export/import mechanism in the `DataTable` component or its related components.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
file: packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```
This file contains the main `DataTable` class, which is likely the source of the issue. The problem might be in how the `DataTable` class exports its nested components (`TableContainer`, `Table`, etc.).

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBody.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file defines the `TableBody` component, but it does not seem directly related to the export/import issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file defines the `TableContainer` component, but it does not seem directly related to the export/import issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/stories/DataTable-basic.stories.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains storybook stories for the `DataTable` component, which are not directly related to the export/import issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/stories/dynamic-content/DataTable-dynamic-content.stories.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains storybook stories for dynamic content in the `DataTable` component, which are not directly related to the export/import issue.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
file: packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```

The `DataTable` class in `DataTable.js` is the primary location that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem. The issue likely lies in how the `DataTable` class exports its nested components, which causes the application to break when destructuring these components.
