### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the screen reader cannot read the label text of the radio button in the React version, whereas it can read the label text in the vanilla HTML version. Specifically, the React version includes an unnecessary `aria-label` attribute on the `<label>` element, which interferes with the screen reader's ability to correctly announce the label text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the inclusion of the `aria-label` attribute on the `<label>` element in the React version. This attribute is not needed because the label text is already present within the `<label>` element and is correctly associated with the `<input>` element via the `for` attribute. The presence of `aria-label` can override the label text, causing the screen reader to ignore the actual label text.
