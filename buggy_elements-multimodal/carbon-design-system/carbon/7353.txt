### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `<button>` elements within the Tabs component do not have an associated label. This results in accessibility issues, as screen readers and other assistive technologies cannot properly identify the purpose of these buttons.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the lack of proper ARIA attributes or associated labels for the `<button>` elements used in the Tabs component. Specifically, the buttons used for horizontal overflow navigation (as seen in the images) do not have `aria-labelledby` or `for` attributes that associate them with meaningful labels. This omission violates accessibility standards and makes it difficult for users relying on assistive technologies to understand the function of these buttons.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Tab` class is responsible for rendering individual tabs, but it does not handle the buttons for horizontal overflow navigation.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TabContent` function is responsible for rendering the content of selected tabs, which is unrelated to the buttons causing the accessibility issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to configuring and displaying the Tabs component in a storybook environment, but they do not directly handle the rendering of the buttons.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```
The `Tabs` class is responsible for managing the overall tabbed interface, including the buttons for horizontal overflow navigation. This class likely contains the logic for rendering the buttons and should be inspected to ensure that the buttons have proper ARIA attributes or associated labels.
