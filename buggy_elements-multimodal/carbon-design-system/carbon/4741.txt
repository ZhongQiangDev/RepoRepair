### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the copy button within the CodeSnippet component is not positioned correctly in `single` mode. Specifically, the `.bx--copy-btn` class is applying a `position: relative` style instead of the expected `position: absolute`, which is causing the button to be misaligned.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the CSS styles applied to the copy button. The `.bx--copy-btn` class is overriding the `position` property to `relative`, which is not the desired behavior. This suggests that the styles for the copy button are being incorrectly applied or overridden by the `CopyButton` component or the `CodeSnippet` component.
