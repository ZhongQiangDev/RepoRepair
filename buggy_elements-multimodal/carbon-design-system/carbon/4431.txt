### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the project requires an alternative styling for the Tabs component. The provided image shows a design with a blue underline and a different visual style compared to the current implementation. The issue is that the current Tabs component does not support this secondary style.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the current implementation of the Tabs component does not include the necessary styling options to match the design shown in the image. This means that the CSS and potentially some of the component's structure need to be updated to accommodate the new style. The current implementation likely only supports a single style, and there is no mechanism to switch between different styles.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The provided information is about a utility function `toArray` and a `Tab` class that seems to be related to a different context (ContentSwitcher). It does not appear to be directly related to the React Tabs component that needs the new styling.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
class: Tab
```
The `Tab` class is a React component that is part of the Tabs system. It manages individual tabs and their styling. To implement the new style, modifications might be needed in this class to support additional styling options.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `TabContent` component is responsible for rendering the content of the selected tab, but it does not directly manage the styling of the tabs themselves.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The functions in this file are related to configuring and demonstrating the Tabs component in a storybook environment. They do not directly affect the implementation of the Tabs component itself.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```
The `Tabs` class is the main React component that manages the Tabs system. It is responsible for rendering the tabs and handling their interactions. To implement the new style, modifications might be needed in this class to support additional styling options and to pass the necessary props to the `Tab` components.
