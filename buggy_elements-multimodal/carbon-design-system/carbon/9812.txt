### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the contrast of shadows in dark themes (G90 and G100) not matching the contrast level of light themes (White and G10). Specifically:

- **Overflow menu shadows**: The current opacity levels for shadows in G90 and G100 themes are too low, resulting in insufficient contrast. The proposal is to either set both to 80% opacity or G90 to 70% and G100 to 80%.
- **Page overlay for Modals**: The current overlay color and transparency do not provide enough contrast. The proposal is to change the overlay color to #000000 with a transparency of 65%.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely due to the current settings for shadow opacity and overlay color/transparency in the dark themes. These settings are not aligned with the desired contrast levels specified for light themes. The issue may stem from the way these styles are defined and applied in the theme configurations.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js ---
This file contains the `Modal` class, which is responsible for rendering modal dialogs. The modal's page overlay is a part of this component. Therefore, the function responsible for setting the overlay color and transparency is relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
class: Modal
```

#### --- packages/themes/src/tokens.js ---
This file contains the `formatTokenName` function, which formats token names for CSS/SCSS usage. While this function is related to token naming, it does not directly affect the shadow opacity or overlay color. Therefore, this file contains no relevant functions/classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/themes/src/tools.js ---
This file contains the `adjustLightness` function, which adjusts the lightness of a color token. This function could be relevant if the shadow opacity or overlay color is derived from a color token whose lightness needs adjustment.

```
packages/themes/src/tools.js
function: adjustLightness
```

#### --- packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js ---
This file contains the `buildThemesFile` function, which generates theme maps for different themes. This function is responsible for defining the theme configurations, including shadow opacity and overlay color. Therefore, this function is relevant.

```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
function: buildThemesFile
```
