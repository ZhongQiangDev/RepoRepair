### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the VoiceOver screen reader reads dropdown items twice when navigating through the items using the keyboard. This indicates a potential issue with how the accessibility attributes or event handlers are set up for the dropdown items.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be related to how the accessibility attributes (like `aria-label`, `aria-selected`, etc.) are being applied to the dropdown items. If these attributes are being set in a way that causes the screen reader to announce the same information twice, it would result in the described behavior. Another possible cause could be related to event handlers that trigger multiple announcements.
