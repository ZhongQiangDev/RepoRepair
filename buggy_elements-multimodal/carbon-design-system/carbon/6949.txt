### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a custom label like "All" is used in the `pageSizes` list, the other labels in the Pagination component become `NaN`. This results in incorrect display of the item range and page range, as shown in the image provided.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the Pagination component expecting numerical values for `pageSizes` and using these values to calculate the item range and page range. When a non-numeric value like "All" is provided, the calculations fail, resulting in `NaN` values being displayed.
