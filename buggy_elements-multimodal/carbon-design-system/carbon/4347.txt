### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Overflow Menu component does not have a `--light` modifier, which results in a grey menu on a grey background, making it difficult to see. The issue is related to the visual appearance of the menu in a light theme.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the lack of specific CSS styles or class modifiers for the Overflow Menu component to support a light theme. The component may not have the necessary CSS classes or styles defined to adjust its appearance when used in a light-themed environment.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily for configuring and demonstrating the OverflowMenu component in a development environment like Storybook. It does not directly handle the styling or theming of the component.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

The `OverflowMenu` class is the main component responsible for rendering the Overflow Menu. It manages the menu's state and behavior but does not directly handle the styling. However, it may need to be updated to accept a `--light` modifier and apply the appropriate styles.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
class: OverflowMenuItem
```

The `OverflowMenuItem` class is responsible for rendering individual menu items. It may need to be updated to support the `--light` modifier to ensure that the menu items are visible and styled correctly in a light theme.

#### `packages/themes/examples/preview/index.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is an example file that demonstrates how to use themes in the Carbon Design System. It does not directly relate to the Overflow Menu component.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
   packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
   class: OverflowMenu
   ```

2. ```
   packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
   class: OverflowMenuItem
   ```

These two locations are relevant because they represent the main components that need to be updated to support the `--light` modifier and ensure proper styling in a light theme. The `OverflowMenu` class manages the overall menu, while the `OverflowMenuItem` class handles individual menu items. Both may need to be updated to include the necessary styles or class modifiers for the light theme.
