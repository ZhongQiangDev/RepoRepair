### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the GitHub problem description is that the `TableBatchActions` component currently does not include a "Select all" button next to the `totalSelected` text. The request is to add this feature as an optional inclusion within the component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `TableBatchActions` component does not currently have the functionality or UI element to display a "Select all" button. This means that the component's structure and logic need to be updated to optionally include this button and handle its behavior when clicked.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.tsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` (TableBatchActions component) is relevant because it is responsible for rendering the batch actions UI, including the summary section and action list. To add the "Select all" button, this function needs to be modified to optionally include the button and handle its click event.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.tsx ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.tsx
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` (TableSelectAll component) is relevant because it renders a checkbox that allows users to select or deselect all rows in the table. This component can be used or adapted to create the "Select all" button functionality.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/state/sorting.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js ---
```
packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js
class: Selection
function: useSelection
```
The `Selection` class and `useSelection` function are relevant because they manage the selection state of items in the table. To implement the "Select all" button, these functions need to be updated to handle the logic for selecting all items across all pages.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js

   ```
2. ```
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.tsx
