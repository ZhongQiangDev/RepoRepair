### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Toggle component does not support a `readonly` state. The component should be able to display a read-only toggle that is not disabled, meaning it should be visually distinct from a disabled toggle and should be announced by screen readers without allowing the value to be changed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the Toggle component currently lacks a `readonly` prop and the associated logic to handle this state. The component needs to be updated to include this prop, apply the appropriate styles, and ensure that the toggle is not interactive but still accessible to screen readers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js`

This file contains the main Toggle component implementation. It needs to be updated to include the `readonly` prop and the necessary logic to handle this state.

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
function: Toggle
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js`

This file contains the stories for the Toggle component. It needs to be updated to include controls for the `readonly` state in the playground and a default story for easy copy and paste.

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js
function: function_3
```

#### `packages/react/src/internal/useControllableState.js`

This file contains the `useControllableState` hook, which manages the state of the Toggle component. It may need to be updated to handle the `readonly` state if the state management logic is affected by this new prop.

```
packages/react/src/internal/useControllableState.js
function: useControllableState
```

#### `packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js`

This file contains the `requiredIfValueExists` function, which validates props. It may need to be updated to include validation for the `readonly` prop if necessary.

```
packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js
function: requiredIfValueExists
```
