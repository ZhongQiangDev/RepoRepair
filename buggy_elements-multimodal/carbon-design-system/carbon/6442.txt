### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `ContentSwitcher` component does not visually contrast well on `ui-01` backgrounds. This lack of contrast makes it difficult for users to distinguish the component from the background, potentially leading to usability issues.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be one of the following:

- **Token Values**: The current token values used for the `ContentSwitcher` may not provide sufficient contrast against the `ui-01` background. Adjusting these tokens could improve the visual distinction.
- **Missing `light` Variant**: The `ContentSwitcher` might need a `light` variant or prop to modify its appearance when placed on lighter backgrounds like `ui-01`. This would allow the component to adapt its styling based on the background color.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js
class: ContentSwitcher
```

The `ContentSwitcher` class is relevant because it defines the component that needs to be modified to include a `light` variant or prop. This change would allow the component to adjust its appearance based on the background.

#### `packages/themes/src/tokens.js`

```
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
function: formatTokenName
```

The `formatTokenName` function is relevant because it formats token names for CSS/SCSS usage. If token values need to be adjusted, this function might be involved in ensuring the new token names are correctly formatted.

#### `packages/themes/tasks/build.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js`

```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
function: buildThemesFile
```

The `buildThemesFile` function is relevant because it generates theme maps for different themes. If new tokens or a `light` variant are added, this function might need to be updated to include the new theme configurations.
