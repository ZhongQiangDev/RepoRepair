### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the cancel search icon button's color contrast is insufficient due to the recently introduced `skyblue` background color for autofill in Chrome. This makes the icon button hard to see and interact with, especially for users with visual impairments.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the styling of the cancel search icon button. The button's color or opacity may not be adjusted to maintain sufficient contrast against the new `skyblue` background color introduced by Chrome's autofill feature. This could be due to hardcoded colors, missing or incorrect CSS rules, or a lack of adaptive styling based on the background color.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Search/Search-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The file is primarily for defining stories in Storybook and does not directly handle the styling or functionality of the Search component.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.js
class: Search
```

The `Search` class is directly responsible for rendering the search input field, including the cancel search icon button. The issue with color contrast likely resides in the styling logic within this class. The class manages the rendering of the clear button and applies CSS classes based on props like `small`, `light`, and `className`. The problem may be in the CSS classes or inline styles applied to the clear button.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.Skeleton.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `SearchSkeleton` component is used for rendering a skeleton loading state and is not directly related to the styling of the cancel search icon button.

#### `packages/react/src/components/SearchFilterButton/SearchFilterButton.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `SearchFilterButton` component is a separate button component and is not directly related to the cancel search icon button in the Search component.
