### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `ComboBox` component is generating React warnings due to duplicate keys when rendering `MenuItem` components. This occurs because the `itemToString` function is being used as the key for `MenuItem`, and if multiple items have the same text, they end up with the same key, violating React's requirement for unique keys.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `itemToString` function, which is used to generate the key for `MenuItem` components, is based on the `text` property of the items. When multiple items have the same `text` value, they will have the same key, leading to the duplicate key warning. To resolve this, the key should be based on a unique identifier, such as the `id` property of the items.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
class: ComboBox
function: function_1
```

The `ComboBox` class is relevant because it is the main component responsible for rendering the `ComboBox` and its `MenuItem` components. The `function_1` (`defaultItemToString`) is relevant because it is the default function used to convert items to strings, which is currently being used as the key for `MenuItem` components.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` (`ListBoxMenuItem`) is relevant because it is the component responsible for rendering individual menu items within the `ListBox`. It is where the key for each `MenuItem` is set, and it needs to be updated to use a unique identifier instead of the `text` property.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
   packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
   class: ComboBox
   function: function_1
   ```
2. ```
   packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
   function: function_1
   ```
