### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components do not currently support supplying a custom `id` to the `legend` element, nor do they allow setting the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `fieldset` to correspond with the `legend`'s `id`. This is necessary for proper screen reader support in IBM Cloud UI.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the current implementation of the `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components does not provide a way to pass custom attributes to the `legend` element or the `fieldset` element. Specifically, there is no mechanism to set an `id` on the `legend` and ensure that the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `fieldset` matches this `id`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### packages/react/src/components/Form/Form.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup-story.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `FormGroup.js` is the `FormGroup` component itself. This function is responsible for rendering the `fieldset` and `legend` elements. To fix the issue, we need to modify this function to accept a `legendId` prop and apply it to the `legend` element. Additionally, we need to set the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `fieldset` to this `legendId`.

#### packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton-story.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
function: function_1
```

This is the only relevant function that needs to be modified to support the custom `legend` `id` and the corresponding `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `fieldset`. The other files do not contain relevant functions or classes for this specific issue.
