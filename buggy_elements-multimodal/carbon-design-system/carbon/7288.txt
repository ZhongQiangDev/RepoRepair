### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the current `onChange` event in the multiselect (dropdown) menu does not provide a way to determine if the user has finished their selection. This leads to immediate row disabling/enabling based on each individual selection change, which is not the desired behavior. The user wants an `onMenuChange` event that triggers when the menu visibility changes, allowing them to know when the user has completed their selection.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the current implementation of the multiselect component only provides an `onChange` event, which is triggered for every individual selection change. There is no event that indicates when the menu is closed or when the user has finished making their selections. This lack of an `onMenuChange` event means that the application cannot reliably determine when the user has completed their selection process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`

This file contains the `Dropdown` class, which is a general dropdown component. While it has an `onChange` event, it does not specifically handle multiselect functionality. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue at hand.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js`

This file contains the `ListBoxSelection` component, which is related to the selection mechanism within a list box. However, it does not handle menu visibility changes or provide an `onMenuChange` event. It is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js`

This file contains the `FilterableMultiSelect` class, which is a multiselect component. It has an `onChange` event but lacks an `onMenuChange` event. This class is relevant to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js
class: FilterableMultiSelect
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js`

This file contains the `MultiSelect` function, which is another multiselect component. It also has an `onChange` event but lacks an `onMenuChange` event. This function is relevant to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
function: MultiSelect
```

#### `packages/react/src/internal/Selection.js`

This file contains the `Selection` class and the `useSelection` hook, which manage the selection state. While they handle selection changes, they do not handle menu visibility changes or provide an `onMenuChange` event. They are not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
