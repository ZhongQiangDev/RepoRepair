### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that new inverse tokens need to be added for high contrast moments such as tooltips, pop-overs, and notifications. Specifically, the tokens `$link-inverse-active` and `$link-inverse-hover` need to be added with the specified color values for different background colors (White, Gray 10, Gray 90, and Gray 100).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the current theme system does not include the necessary inverse tokens for high contrast moments. This means that the existing token definitions and the logic for generating and applying these tokens need to be updated to include the new tokens and their respective values.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/themes/src/tokens.js ---
```
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
function: formatTokenName
```
The `formatTokenName` function is relevant because it is responsible for formatting token names, which will be necessary when adding the new inverse tokens.

#### --- packages/themes/src/tools.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `adjustLightness` function is not directly related to adding new tokens but rather to adjusting the lightness of existing color tokens.

#### --- packages/themes/src/next/tokens/Token.js ---
```
packages/themes/src/next/tokens/Token.js
class: Token
```
The `Token` class is relevant because it is used to encapsulate thematic units, and new tokens will need to be created using this class.

#### --- packages/themes/tasks/build.js ---
```
packages/themes/tasks/build.js
function: build
function: buildThemesFile
function: buildTokensFile
```
The `build` function orchestrates the build process, which includes generating theme maps and tokens. The `buildThemesFile` and `buildTokensFile` functions are responsible for creating the theme maps and tokens files, respectively. These functions will need to be updated to include the new inverse tokens.

#### --- packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js ---
```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js
function: buildTokensFile
```
The `buildTokensFile` function is relevant because it generates the `_tokens.scss` file, which will need to include the new inverse tokens.
