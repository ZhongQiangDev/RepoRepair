### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the pagination footer shows "items" and "pages" in plural form even when there is only one item or one page. The expected behavior is to show the singular form ("item" and "page") when the count is one.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the current implementation of the pagination component does not include conditional logic to handle singular and plural forms based on the count of items or pages. Specifically, the functions responsible for generating the text for the item range and page range need to check if the count is one and adjust the text accordingly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily for configuring and testing the Pagination component and does not directly affect the text generation logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js`

This file contains the main `Pagination` class, which is responsible for rendering the pagination controls. The issue described is likely related to the text generation logic within this class.

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/PageSelector.js`

This file contains the `PageSelector` function, which is a dropdown menu for pagination navigation. It does not directly handle the text generation for the footer.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js`

This file contains several functions that generate text for the pagination footer. These functions need to be examined for the conditional logic to handle singular and plural forms.

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
function: function_7
function: function_8
function: function_9
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations
