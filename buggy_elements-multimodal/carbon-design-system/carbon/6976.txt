### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the following issues within the `OverflowMenu` component:

- The `focusable="false"` attribute is applied to a `span` element, which does not support the `focusable` attribute.
- The `tabindex="0"` attribute is set on a `button` element, which is unnecessary because buttons are focusable by default.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues is likely due to the default values being set within the `OverflowMenu` component in `carbon-components-react`. Specifically:

- The `focusable="false"` attribute is being applied to a `span` element, which is not a focusable element by default and does not support the `focusable` attribute.
- The `tabindex="0"` is being set on a `button` element, which already has a default `tabindex` of `0` and is inherently focusable.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/components/src/components/overflow-menu/overflow-menu.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```
The `OverflowMenu` class is relevant because it is the React component that implements the `OverflowMenu`. The issues described in the GitHub problem description are likely related to the default values set within this component.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

The `OverflowMenu` class in `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js` is the relevant location where the default values for `focusable="false"` and `tabindex="0"` are likely being set. These values need to be inspected and potentially removed or modified to address the issues described in the GitHub problem description.
