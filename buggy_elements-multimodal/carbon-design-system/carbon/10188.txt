### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when an icon is selected from the Dropdown component, the `title` attribute of the button displays `[object Object]` instead of the expected icon or label. This issue arises because the `itemToString` function is being used to convert the selected item into a string, which results in the default string representation of an object (`[object Object]`) when the selected item is an object.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `itemToString` function is being used to render the selected item in the Dropdown button. This function is designed to convert an item into a string, but when the item is an object (as in the case of the IconDropdown component), it returns `[object Object]`. The user suggests adding a prop to determine whether `itemToElement` or `itemToString` should be used to render the selected item in the dropdown.
