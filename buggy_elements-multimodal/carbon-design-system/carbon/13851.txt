### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem description indicates that the time picker component needs to update its default style for the error state and add a warning state for the text input. The current implementation may not be consistent with other form components in terms of error and warning states.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior likely stems from the current implementation of the time picker component not adhering to the design specifications for error and warning states. This could involve missing or incorrect styling, missing or incorrect ARIA attributes, or missing logic to handle the warning state.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/util.js ---

This file contains utility functions that handle the invalid and warning states for text inputs. The functions `function_1`, `function_2`, and `function_3` are relevant to the problem because they manage the properties and attributes for invalid and warning states.

```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/util.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
```

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/useNormalizedInputProps.js ---

This file contains the `useNormalizedInputProps` function, which normalizes input props and handles the logic for different states, including invalid and warning states. This function is relevant because it determines the final props that are used to render the input component.

```
packages/react/src/internal/useNormalizedInputProps.js
function: useNormalizedInputProps
```
