### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description mentions a "combo button" that is intended to replace a "contextual menu." The issue seems to be that the current implementation of the contextual menu is taking up too much space in the local navigation. The goal is to create a more compact solution that still allows users to access the necessary actions.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the problem is likely related to the design and implementation of the current contextual menu. The menu may be displaying all options by default, which leads to it occupying a significant portion of the navigation space. The proposed solution is to implement a combo button that can collapse the options into a more compact form, only expanding when the user interacts with it.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js ---
This file contains the `Menu` component, which is likely the current implementation of the contextual menu. Since the problem is related to the menu taking up too much space, this file is highly relevant.

```
packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js
function: Menu
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Menu/MenuItem.js ---
This file contains the `MenuItem` component, which is used to create individual items within the menu. While this file is related to the menu, it is not directly responsible for the space issue. However, it may need to be modified if the design of the combo button requires changes to how menu items are displayed.

```
packages/react/src/components/Menu/MenuItem.js
function: MenuItem
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js ---
This file contains the `OverflowMenu` component, which is another type of menu that could potentially be used as a basis for the combo button. The `OverflowMenu` component already has features like collapsing options, which aligns with the goal of creating a more compact menu.

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
function: function_4
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuV2/index.js ---
This file contains the `OverflowMenuV2` component, which is a newer version of the `OverflowMenu` component. It uses React hooks and may provide a more modern and flexible solution for implementing the combo button.

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuV2/index.js
function: OverflowMenuV2
```

#### --- packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js ---
This file contains the `FloatingMenu` component, which is used to render menus that are detached from their triggering elements. While this file is related to menu positioning, it is not directly relevant to the space issue. However, it may need to be considered if the combo button requires a specific positioning behavior.

```
packages/react/src/internal/FloatingMenu.js
class: FloatingMenu
```

### Summary

The files that are most relevant to the problem and its solution are:

```
packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js
function: Menu
