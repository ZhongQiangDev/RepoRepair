### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the page selector in the `Pagination` component becomes unsuitable when there are many pages. Specifically, the `Select` component used for page selection displays a long dropdown list that extends beyond the browser window, requiring users to scroll up and down to find and select the desired page. This results in a poor user experience.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the use of a `Select` component for page selection in the `Pagination` component. When there are many pages, the dropdown list becomes excessively long, leading to the described scrolling problem. A more suitable solution would be to allow users to directly input the page number using a `TextInput` or `NumberInput` component, which would provide a better user experience for tables with many pages.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```

The `Pagination` class is directly responsible for rendering the page selector. It currently uses a `Select` component for page selection, which is the source of the problem. This class needs to be modified to use a different component for page selection.

#### packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js

```
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.js
function: Select
```

The `Select` component is used by the `Pagination` component for page selection. Since this component is causing the issue, it may need to be replaced with a more suitable component like `TextInput` or `NumberInput`.

#### packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js

```
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
class: NumberInput
```

The `NumberInput` component could be a suitable replacement for the `Select` component in the `Pagination` component. It allows users to directly input a number, which would be more appropriate for tables with many pages.

#### packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js

```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
function: TextInput
```

The `TextInput` component could also be a suitable replacement for the `Select` component in the `Pagination` component. It allows users to directly input a page number, which would be more appropriate for tables with many pages.

#### packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarSearch.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `TableToolbarSearch` component is not directly related to the page selection issue in the `Pagination` component. Therefore, it is not relevant to the problem described.
