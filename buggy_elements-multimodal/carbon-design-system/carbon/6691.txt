### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `legendText` prop of the `FormGroup` component only accepts `string` values and does not support `object` values, such as a `Tooltip` component. This limitation prevents the user from adding help information to the legend text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the prop type validation in the `FormGroup` component. The `legendText` prop is expected to be a `string`, and when an `object` (like a `Tooltip` component) is passed, it triggers a prop type warning.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js ---
This file contains the `FormGroup` component, which is directly related to the issue. The `legendText` prop is used to display the legend for the form group. To support `object` values, the prop type validation needs to be modified.

```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js ---
This file contains the `TextInput` component, which is not directly related to the issue. However, it supports `object` values for the `labelText` prop, which can serve as a reference for implementing similar functionality in the `FormGroup` component.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js ---
This file contains the `Tooltip` component, which the user wants to use as the `legendText` prop value. The `Tooltip` component itself does not need changes, but it will be used in the modified `FormGroup` component.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/childrenOfType.js ---
This file contains a custom prop type validator, which is not directly related to the issue. However, it can serve as a reference for creating a custom prop type validator for the `legendText` prop if needed.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
