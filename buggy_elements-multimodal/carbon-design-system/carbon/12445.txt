### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the combobox implementation needs to support a read-only mode. The acceptance criteria specify that the component should be coded in `/package/react`, include a prop for read-only mode with associated styles, provide controls for each state in the playground, include a default story for easy copy and paste, and have RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the combobox does not include support for a read-only mode. This means that the component lacks the necessary prop to enable read-only functionality, the associated styles for the read-only state, and the necessary controls and stories in the playground to demonstrate and test this feature. Additionally, RTL tests for the read-only class are missing.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js ---
This file contains the core logic for the ComboBox component. To support read-only mode, the following functions or classes need to be inspected or edited:

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
function: function_5
```

- `function_5` is the main function that defines the ComboBox component. It needs to be updated to include a new prop for read-only mode and handle the associated logic and styles.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js ---
This file contains the stories for the ComboBox component. To support read-only mode, the following functions need to be inspected or edited:

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_12
```

- `function_1` and `function_12` are story functions that render the ComboBox component. They need to be updated to include controls for the read-only mode and a default story for easy copy and paste.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js ---
This file contains the TextInput component, which is not directly related to the ComboBox component. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
