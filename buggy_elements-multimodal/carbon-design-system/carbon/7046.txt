### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `TimePicker` component needs to support size variants for `32px` and `48px`. The current implementation does not include these size variants, and the image provided shows the desired sizes for the component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `TimePicker` component and its related styles do not currently support the specified size variants (`32px` and `48px`). This likely involves updating the component's styling and potentially its structure to accommodate these new sizes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/bundler/src/bundlers/scss.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.js

```

The `TimePicker` class is relevant because it is the component that needs to be updated to support the new size variants.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TimePickerSelect/TimePickerSelect.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
