### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the icon-only Tabs and ContainedTabs variant should support two sizes: 40px as default and 48px as large. The provided image shows that the current implementation only supports the default size (40px) and does not have the large size (48px) implemented.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a size prop in the relevant components that would allow for the specification of the large size (48px). The components need to be updated to accept a size prop and adjust their dimensions accordingly.
