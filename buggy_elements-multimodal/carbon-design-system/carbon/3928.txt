### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `iconDescription` for the `TableBatchAction` is being read by JAWS (a screen reader) even when there are visible labels on the buttons. This causes redundant information to be read aloud, which is not ideal for accessibility. Additionally, the default value for `iconDescription` is set to 'Add', which is incorrect and should be an empty string (`''`).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the way the `TableBatchAction` component is implemented. Specifically, it seems that the `iconDescription` prop is being passed to the `Button` component without proper validation or default handling. When `iconDescription` is not provided, it defaults to 'Add', which is incorrect. Furthermore, the `iconDescription` should only be required when there are no children (visible labels) in the button.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```
The `Button` component is where the `iconDescription` prop is used. It needs to be modified to ensure that `iconDescription` is only required when there are no children and should default to an empty string (`''`).

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js
function: function_1
```
The `TableBatchAction` component is a wrapper for the `Button` component. It needs to be checked to ensure that it is passing the correct props to the `Button` component, especially the `iconDescription` prop.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js
function: function_2
```
The `TableBatchActions` component contains the `TableBatchAction` components. It should be checked to ensure that it is passing the correct props to the `TableBatchAction` components, especially the `iconDescription` prop.

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/isRequiredOneOf.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to prop type validation but does not directly affect the `iconDescription` issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/prop-types/tools/createChainableTypeChecker.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is a utility for creating custom prop validators and does not directly affect the `iconDescription` issue.
