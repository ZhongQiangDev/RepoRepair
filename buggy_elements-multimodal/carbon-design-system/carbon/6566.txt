### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the pagination component overflows its container on smaller viewports, causing it to be partially or completely hidden. This issue occurs when the viewport size is smaller than 42rem, and the pagination elements exceed the container's width.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the CSS styling of the pagination component. The pagination elements are not properly responsive, and their width is not adjusted to fit within the container on smaller viewports. This could be due to fixed widths, lack of flexbox or grid layout, or missing media queries that adjust the layout for smaller screens.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/components/src/components/pagination/pagination.js`

This file contains the `Pagination` class, which manages the pagination interactions and events. However, it does not contain any CSS styling or layout logic. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the issue of pagination overflow.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/components/src/components/pagination-nav/pagination-nav.js`

This file contains the `PaginationNav` class, which handles the navigation buttons and page selection. Similar to the previous file, it does not contain any CSS styling or layout logic. Therefore, this file is also not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js`

This file contains the `Pagination` class, which is a React component that renders the pagination control. This file is relevant because it likely contains the JSX and CSS styling that defines the layout and appearance of the pagination component.

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```

The `Pagination` class in `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js` is the relevant location that needs inspection or editing to fix the pagination overflow issue. The CSS styling and layout logic within this class should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure the pagination elements are responsive and fit within the container on smaller viewports.
