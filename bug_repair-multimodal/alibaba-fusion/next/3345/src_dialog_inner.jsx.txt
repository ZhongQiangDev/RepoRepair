I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about the close button position in the Dialog component when there's no title. As shown in the screenshot, the close button is overlapping with text content when there's no title.

Looking at the code, I can see that the close button is rendered outside of the header, body, and footer sections. When there's no title, the header isn't rendered, but the close button still appears in the same position, which causes it to overlap with the content.

## Solution

We need to adjust the CSS class applied to the dialog container when there's no title. This will allow us to style the dialog differently when there's no title, ensuring the close button is positioned correctly.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/dialog/inner.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        const newClassName = cx({
            [`${prefix}dialog`]: true,
            [`${prefix}closeable`]: closeable,
            [className]: !!className,
        });
=======
        const newClassName = cx({
            [`${prefix}dialog`]: true,
            [`${prefix}closeable`]: closeable,
            [`${prefix}dialog-no-title`]: closeable && !title,
            [className]: !!className,
        });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new CSS class `${prefix}dialog-no-title` to the dialog container when it's closeable but has no title. With this class, you can add specific CSS styles in your stylesheet to adjust the close button position when there's no title, preventing it from overlapping with the content.

The CSS for this class would need to be added to your dialog styles file, but since that wasn't included in the provided code, I'm only showing the React component change that enables the styling.
