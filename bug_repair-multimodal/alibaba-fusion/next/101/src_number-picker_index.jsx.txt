I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is related to JavaScript floating-point precision problems. When adding 0.01 to 4.02, JavaScript returns 4.029999999999999 instead of 4.03 due to how floating-point numbers are represented in binary. This causes display issues in the NumberPicker component.

The problem occurs in the `upStep` method where the calculation is performed. The current implementation doesn't properly handle floating-point precision issues.

## Fix

We need to modify the `upStep` method to ensure proper rounding after the calculation. The issue is that while the code has a precision factor, it doesn't properly apply rounding in the `upStep` method (while it does in the `downStep` method).

```javascript
### src/number-picker/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    upStep(val) {
        const {step, min} = this.props;
        const precisionFactor = this.getPrecisionFactor();
        let result;
        if (typeof val === 'number') {
            result = (precisionFactor * val + precisionFactor * step) / precisionFactor;
        } else {
            result = min === -Infinity ? step : min;
        }
        return result;
    }
=======
    upStep(val) {
        const {step, min} = this.props;
        const precisionFactor = this.getPrecisionFactor();
        let result;
        if (typeof val === 'number') {
            result = (precisionFactor * val + precisionFactor * step) / precisionFactor;
            
            // Fix floating point precision issues (similar to downStep)
            const precision = this.getPrecision();
            if (precision > 0) {
                result = Number(Number(result).toFixed(precision));
            }
        } else {
            result = min === -Infinity ? step : min;
        }
        return result;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the same rounding logic that's already present in the `downStep` method to the `upStep` method. It ensures that after calculating the new value, we round it to the appropriate precision to avoid floating-point errors.

The solution uses `Number(result).toFixed(precision)` to convert the result to a string with the specified precision, and then converts it back to a number with `Number()`. This ensures that values like 4.029999999999999 will be properly displayed as 4.03 when the precision is set to 2.
