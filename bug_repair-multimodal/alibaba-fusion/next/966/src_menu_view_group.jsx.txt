I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue states that when a Menu.Group contains spaces in its children, it's causing an error. Looking at the code, I can see the problem:

In the `render` method of the `Group` component, there's a call to `children.map()`. This assumes that `children` is always an array, but in React, `children` can be:
- A single React element
- An array of React elements
- A string (which happens when there's just text or spaces)
- null or undefined

When there are spaces in the JSX between child elements, React treats these spaces as text nodes. When the code tries to call `map()` on a string or a single element, it will throw an error.

## Fix

We need to ensure that `children` is always treated as an array by using `React.Children.map()` instead of directly calling `map()` on `children`.

```javascript
### src/menu/view/group.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        const newChildren = children.map(child => {
            const { className } = child.props;
            const newChildClassName = cx({
                [`${prefix}menu-group-item`]: true,
                [className]: !!className,
            });

            return cloneElement(child, {
                parentMode,
                className: newChildClassName,
            });
        });
=======
        const newChildren = React.Children.map(children, child => {
            if (!React.isValidElement(child)) {
                return child;
            }
            
            const { className } = child.props;
            const newChildClassName = cx({
                [`${prefix}menu-group-item`]: true,
                [className]: !!className,
            });

            return cloneElement(child, {
                parentMode,
                className: newChildClassName,
            });
        });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Uses `React.Children.map()` which safely handles all types of children
2. Adds a check with `React.isValidElement()` to ensure we only try to access props on valid React elements
3. Returns non-element children as-is (like text nodes)

This will prevent the error when there are spaces or other non-element content in the children of a Menu.Group.
