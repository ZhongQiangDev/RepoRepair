I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is with the Search component's behavior when autocomplete suggestions are shown:

1. When a user types "r", autocomplete suggestions appear
2. When the user presses Enter, the search is performed with the input value "r" instead of selecting the first suggestion "Recent"

The problem is in the `onKeyDown` method. Currently, when Enter is pressed, it directly calls `onSearch()` which uses the current input value, ignoring any highlighted autocomplete suggestion.

The fix should ensure that when Enter is pressed and there are autocomplete suggestions, the component should select the highlighted suggestion before performing the search.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/search/Search.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    onKeyDown = e => {
        if (this.props.disabled) {
            return;
        }
        if (e.keyCode !== KEYCODE.ENTER) {
            return;
        }
        this.onSearch();
    };
=======
    onKeyDown = e => {
        if (this.props.disabled) {
            return;
        }
        if (e.keyCode !== KEYCODE.ENTER) {
            return;
        }
        // Don't handle Enter key here as it will be handled by AutoComplete's onPressEnter
        // This prevents duplicate handling which was causing the issue
        // The onPressEnter in AutoComplete will select the highlighted item first
    };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to modify the AutoComplete component to properly handle the Enter key:

```javascript
### src/search/Search.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    onPressEnter={this.onSearch}
=======
                    onPressEnter={() => {
                        // This will be called after AutoComplete has selected the highlighted item
                        this.onSearch();
                    }}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that when Enter is pressed:
1. The `onKeyDown` handler doesn't immediately trigger a search with the current input value
2. The AutoComplete component's `onPressEnter` handler is called, which will first select the highlighted suggestion and then trigger the search with the selected value

This fixes the issue where pressing Enter would search for the input text instead of the highlighted suggestion.
