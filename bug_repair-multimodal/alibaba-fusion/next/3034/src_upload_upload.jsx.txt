I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue states that the Upload component doesn't support delete functionality when using `itemRender`. Looking at the code, I can see that the Upload component has a `removeFile` method, but it's not being passed to the List component when a custom `itemRender` is provided.

The problem is that when a user provides a custom `itemRender` prop to customize the rendering of upload items, they lose access to the delete functionality because the component doesn't expose the necessary methods to handle file deletion in the custom render function.

## Solution

We need to modify the Upload component to pass the `removeFile` method to the List component, which can then make it available to the custom `itemRender` function. This way, users can implement their own UI for file items while still having access to the delete functionality.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/upload/upload.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                        onPreview={onPreview}
                        extraRender={extraRender}
                        rtl={rtl}
=======
                        onPreview={onPreview}
                        extraRender={extraRender}
                        rtl={rtl}
                        itemRender={this.props.itemRender}
                        removeFile={this.removeFile}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change passes the `itemRender` prop from the Upload component to the List component, along with the `removeFile` method. This allows the List component to provide the delete functionality to custom item renderers.

Note: The issue doesn't show the List component implementation, but I'm assuming that the List component needs to be updated to use these props. The fix above is the first step to ensure the necessary props are passed down from the Upload component to the List component.
