I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the screenshots in the issue, the problem is with the `onBlur` event type definition in the `InputProps` interface. The current definition for `onBlur` is:

```typescript
/**
 * 失去焦点时候触发的回调
 */
onBlur?: () => void;
```

However, the error message shows that the actual implementation is trying to use `onBlur` with an event parameter, but the type definition doesn't include this parameter.

Here's the fix:

```typescript
### types/input/index.d.ts
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * 失去焦点时候触发的回调
     */
    onBlur?: () => void;
=======
    /**
     * 失去焦点时候触发的回调
     */
    onBlur?: (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the `onBlur` type definition to include the event parameter, which is a `React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>`. This matches the pattern used for the `onChange` handler and will allow developers to access the event object in their `onBlur` handlers.
