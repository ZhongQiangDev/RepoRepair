I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue states: "[Slider]slidesToShow > slidesCount && infinite={false} && defaultActiveIndex !== 0 左箭头被禁用" 

This translates to: "When slidesToShow > slidesCount and infinite=false and defaultActiveIndex is not 0, the left arrow is disabled."

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `isDisabled` method of the `Arrow` component. When `slideCount <= slidesToShow`, the method returns `true` for both arrow types, disabling both arrows. However, when `slidesToShow > slidesCount` and the current slide is not at the beginning, the left arrow should still be enabled to allow navigation back to the first slide.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        // 下一个 index 大于总数？？
        if (slideCount <= slidesToShow) {
            return true;
        }

        // 向前箭头：当前是第 0 个
        if (type === 'prev') {
            return currentSlide <= 0;
        }
=======
        // When slides to show is greater than total slides
        if (slideCount <= slidesToShow) {
            // For prev arrow, only disable when we're at the first slide
            if (type === 'prev') {
                return currentSlide <= 0;
            }
            // For next arrow, always disable as we can show all slides at once
            return true;
        }

        // 向前箭头：当前是第 0 个
        if (type === 'prev') {
            return currentSlide <= 0;
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix changes the logic when `slideCount <= slidesToShow`. Instead of disabling both arrows, it now:
1. Only disables the previous (left) arrow when the current slide is at the beginning (currentSlide <= 0)
2. Always disables the next (right) arrow since all slides can be shown at once

This way, when the defaultActiveIndex is not 0 (meaning we're not at the first slide), the left arrow will remain enabled, allowing the user to navigate back to the first slide.
