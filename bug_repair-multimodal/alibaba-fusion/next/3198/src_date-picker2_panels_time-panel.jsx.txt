I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when `timePanelProps.defaultValue` is set, the DatePicker2 component shows "Invalid Date". Looking at the screenshot and the codesandbox link, it appears that the `defaultValue` from `timePanelProps` is not being properly handled.

The problem is in the `time-panel.jsx` file. When the `TimePickerPanel` component is rendered, it's passing all `timePanelProps` to the component, including `defaultValue`. However, it's also explicitly setting the `value` prop, which is overriding any default value behavior.

The issue is that when `value` is undefined or null, the component should use the `defaultValue` from `timePanelProps`, but it's not doing that. Instead, it's passing both props to the underlying component, causing a conflict.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                <TimePickerPanel
                    prefix={prefix}
                    locale={locale}
                    onSelect={this.onSelect}
                    showHour={showHour}
                    showSecond={showSecond}
                    showMinute={showMinute}
                    {...timePanelProps}
                    value={value}
                />
=======
                <TimePickerPanel
                    prefix={prefix}
                    locale={locale}
                    onSelect={this.onSelect}
                    showHour={showHour}
                    showSecond={showSecond}
                    showMinute={showMinute}
                    {...timePanelProps}
                    value={value || timePanelProps.defaultValue}
                />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when `value` is null or undefined, the component will fall back to using `timePanelProps.defaultValue`. This way, the `defaultValue` will be properly used when no value is explicitly provided, resolving the "Invalid Date" issue.
