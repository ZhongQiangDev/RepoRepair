I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, the problem is that Elixir attributes can end with a question mark (`?`), but the current regex pattern for `attr-name` in the Prism syntax highlighter doesn't account for this.

The issue specifically points to line 40 in the file, which contains:
```
'attr-name': /\w+:(?!:)/,
```

The suggested fix is to change it to:
```
'attr-name': /\w+?\?:(?!:)/,
```

However, this suggested fix isn't quite right. The correct pattern should match attribute names that are composed of word characters and may optionally end with a question mark, followed by a colon (but not a double colon).

Here's the proper fix:

```javascript
### components/prism-elixir.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  // Look-ahead prevents bad highlighting of the :: operator
  'attr-name': /\w+:(?!:)/,
=======
  // Look-ahead prevents bad highlighting of the :: operator
  'attr-name': /\w+\??:(?!:)/,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This pattern `\w+\??:(?!:)` matches:
- `\w+`: One or more word characters
- `\??`: An optional question mark
- `:(?!:)`: A colon that is not followed by another colon

This will correctly highlight attribute names in Elixir that may end with a question mark.
