I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that the `#` character is being incorrectly identified as a shell-symbol token in the output section of the shell session. Looking at the screenshot and the code snippet provided in the issue, we can see that lines starting with `#` in the output section are being highlighted as if they were commands.

The problem is in the regular expression pattern for the `command` property. It's matching any line that starts with `$` or `#`, but in shell sessions, `#` is not always a command prompt - it can also appear in the output as a comment or informational message.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### components/prism-shell-session.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	'command': {
		pattern: RegExp(/[$#](?:[^\\\r\n'"<]|\\.|<<str>>)+/.source.replace(/<<str>>/g, function () { return strings; })),
		greedy: true,
		inside: {
			'bash': {
				pattern: /(^[$#]\s*)[\s\S]+/,
				lookbehind: true,
				alias: 'language-bash',
				inside: Prism.languages.bash
			},
			'shell-symbol': {
				pattern: /^[$#]/,
				alias: 'important'
			}
		}
	},
=======
	'command': {
		pattern: RegExp(/^[$](?:[^\\\r\n'"<]|\\.|<<str>>)+/.source.replace(/<<str>>/g, function () { return strings; })),
		greedy: true,
		inside: {
			'bash': {
				pattern: /(^[$]\s*)[\s\S]+/,
				lookbehind: true,
				alias: 'language-bash',
				inside: Prism.languages.bash
			},
			'shell-symbol': {
				pattern: /^[$]/,
				alias: 'important'
			}
		}
	},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the command pattern to only match lines that start with `$` (the standard shell prompt) and not `#` (which can appear in output text). This will prevent the incorrect highlighting of lines in the output that start with `#`.
