I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that the TypeScript syntax highlighting in Prism.js is incorrectly identifying certain property names (like "type") as keywords when they appear in interfaces or types. This happens because the keyword regex pattern is too broad and doesn't exclude property names in object-like contexts.

Looking at the screenshot and the issue description, we can see that the "type" property in the interface is being highlighted as a keyword, which is incorrect. The "type" should only be highlighted as a keyword when it's used as an actual TypeScript keyword (like in "type MyType = string").

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### components/prism-typescript.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH

```

This fix modifies the keyword regex pattern for the "type" keyword specifically. The change adds a negative lookahead `(?!\s*[:\w$])` after "type" to ensure it's not followed by a colon or other characters that would indicate it's being used as a property name. This way, "type" will only be highlighted as a keyword when it's actually used as a keyword, not when it's used as a property name in an interface or type definition.
