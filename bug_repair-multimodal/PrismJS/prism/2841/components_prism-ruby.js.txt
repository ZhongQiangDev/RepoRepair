I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that interpolation in regex literals using the `/foo#{bar}/` syntax is not being highlighted correctly in Ruby, while it works fine with the `%r{foo#{bar}}` syntax.

Looking at the code, I can see that the problem is in the regex pattern definition. The second regex pattern (for `/.../ syntax`) doesn't include the interpolation handling that's present in the first regex pattern (for `%r` syntax).

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### components/prism-ruby.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
			{
				pattern: /(^|[^/])\/(?!\/)(?:\[[^\r\n\]]+\]|\\.|[^[/\\\r\n])+\/[gim]{0,3}(?=\s*(?:$|[\r\n,.;})]))/,
				lookbehind: true,
				greedy: true
			}
=======
			{
				pattern: /(^|[^/])\/(?!\/)(?:\[[^\r\n\]]+\]|\\.|[^[/\\\r\n])+\/[gim]{0,3}(?=\s*(?:$|[\r\n,.;})]))/,
				lookbehind: true,
				greedy: true,
				inside: {
					'interpolation': interpolation
				}
			}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the `inside: { 'interpolation': interpolation }` property to the second regex pattern, which handles the standard `/.../ syntax` for regular expressions in Ruby. This will allow the interpolation to be properly highlighted in both regex syntaxes.
