I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that single-package package names (like "baz" in the example) are not being highlighted in Java code. Looking at the code, I can see that the problem is in the namespace pattern definition.

Currently, the namespace pattern requires at least one dot in the package name (`[a-z]\w*(?:\.[a-z]\w*)+`). This means it only matches multi-level package names like "foo.bar" but not single-level package names like "baz".

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### components/prism-java.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		'namespace': {
			pattern: /(\b(?:exports|import(?:\s+static)?|module|open|opens|package|provides|requires|to|transitive|uses|with)\s+)[a-z]\w*(?:\.[a-z]\w*)+/,
			lookbehind: true,
			inside: {
				'punctuation': /\./,
			}
		},
=======
		'namespace': {
			pattern: /(\b(?:exports|import(?:\s+static)?|module|open|opens|package|provides|requires|to|transitive|uses|with)\s+)[a-z]\w*(?:\.[a-z]\w*)*/,
			lookbehind: true,
			inside: {
				'punctuation': /\./,
			}
		},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The change I made is to modify the regex pattern from `[a-z]\w*(?:\.[a-z]\w*)+` to `[a-z]\w*(?:\.[a-z]\w*)*`. 

This change allows for:
- Single-level package names (like "baz") by making the dot and subsequent identifier optional
- Multi-level package names (like "foo.bar") as before

The `+` quantifier meant "one or more occurrences" of the dot and subsequent identifier, while the `*` quantifier means "zero or more occurrences", which allows for single-package names.
