I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when ESLint's `--fix` option is used with both `prefer-const` and `no-undef-init` rules enabled, it incorrectly transforms code like `let foo = undefined;` into `const foo;` which is invalid JavaScript (const declarations must be initialized).

The problem occurs because:
1. The `prefer-const` rule identifies that `foo` is never reassigned and suggests changing it to `const`
2. The `no-undef-init` rule removes the `= undefined` initialization
3. These fixes are applied independently without considering their interaction

Looking at the code in `prefer-const.js`, the issue is in the `checkGroup` function. When determining if a fix should be applied, it doesn't check if the initialization is being removed by another rule.

## Fix

We need to modify the `shouldFix` condition to ensure we don't convert to `const` when the initialization is `undefined` (which might be removed by the `no-undef-init` rule).

```javascript
### lib/rules/prefer-const.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                let shouldFix = varDeclParent &&

                    // Don't do a fix unless all variables in the declarations are initialized (or it's in a for-in or for-of loop)
                    (varDeclParent.parent.type === "ForInStatement" || varDeclParent.parent.type === "ForOfStatement" ||
                        varDeclParent.declarations.every(declaration => declaration.init)) &&

                    /*
                     * If options.destructuring is "all", then this warning will not occur unless
                     * every assignment in the destructuring should be const. In that case, it's safe
                     * to apply the fix.
                     */
                    nodesToReport.length === nodes.length;

                let shouldFix = varDeclParent &&

                    // Don't do a fix unless all variables in the declarations are initialized (or it's in a for-in or for-of loop)
                    (varDeclParent.parent.type === "ForInStatement" || varDeclParent.parent.type === "ForOfStatement" ||
                        varDeclParent.declarations.every(declaration => {
                            // Don't fix if the initialization is `undefined` as it might be removed by no-undef-init rule
                            return declaration.init && 
                                !(declaration.init.type === "Identifier" && declaration.init.name === "undefined");
                        })) &&

                    /*
                     * If options.destructuring is "all", then this warning will not occur unless
                     * every assignment in the destructuring should be const. In that case, it's safe
                     * to apply the fix.
                     */
                    nodesToReport.length === nodes.length;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a check to ensure that we don't apply the `prefer-const` fix when a variable is initialized with the identifier `undefined`, which would potentially conflict with the `no-undef-init` rule. This prevents the creation of invalid code like `const foo;`.
