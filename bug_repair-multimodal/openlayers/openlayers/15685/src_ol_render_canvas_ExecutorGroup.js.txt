I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is related to the `setFill()` method in OpenLayers styles for VectorTile layers. When a fill style is applied to a VectorTile layer, it creates an unwanted semi-transparent layer on top of other layers.

Looking at the issue description and the provided code, the problem appears to be in how the `ExecutorGroup` class handles the rendering of different builder types. The issue specifically mentions that removing the fill from the style resolves the problem, which suggests that the fill is being rendered incorrectly.

In the `ExecutorGroup.js` file, the `execute` method is responsible for rendering different builder types. The issue is likely related to how polygon fills are being rendered.

Looking at the code, I notice that the `NON_DECLUTTER` array is defined but not properly initialized. It's supposed to filter out the declutter types from the `ALL` array, but the filter function is empty. This could be causing the fill to be rendered incorrectly.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const NON_DECLUTTER = ALL.filter(

);
=======
export const NON_DECLUTTER = ALL.filter(
  (builderType) => !DECLUTTER.includes(builderType)
);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix properly initializes the `NON_DECLUTTER` array by filtering out the builder types that are in the `DECLUTTER` array. This ensures that polygon fills are rendered correctly and don't create an additional semi-transparent layer on top of other layers.

The issue is that without properly filtering the builder types, the fill style might be applied multiple times or in the wrong order, causing the visual artifacts described in the issue.
