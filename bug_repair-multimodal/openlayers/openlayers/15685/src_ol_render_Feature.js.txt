I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The problem is related to the `setFill()` method in OpenLayers styles when used with VectorTile layers. According to the issue:

1. When a `fill` property is included in the style for a VectorTile layer, it creates an unwanted semi-transparent layer on top of other layers.
2. Removing the fill from the style fixes the issue, but the user needs the fill to style their layer.

Looking at the code provided, the issue is likely in how the `RenderFeature` class handles polygon geometries. The problem appears to be that when a polygon is rendered from a VectorTile, it's creating an additional polygon shape that's being filled, causing the unwanted semi-transparent layer.

The key issue is in the `toGeometry` function in `src/ol/render/Feature.js`. When handling the 'Polygon' type, it's not correctly distinguishing between single polygons and multi-polygons, which can lead to rendering artifacts.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/render/Feature.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    case 'Polygon':
      const flatCoordinates = renderFeature.getFlatCoordinates();
      const ends = renderFeature.getEnds();
      const endss = inflateEnds(flatCoordinates, ends);
      return endss.length > 1
        ? new MultiPolygon(flatCoordinates, 'XY', endss)
        : new Polygon(flatCoordinates, 'XY', ends);
=======
    case 'Polygon':
      const flatCoordinates = renderFeature.getFlatCoordinates();
      const ends = renderFeature.getEnds();
      if (!ends) {
        return new Polygon(flatCoordinates, 'XY');
      }
      const endss = inflateEnds(flatCoordinates, ends);
      return endss.length > 1
        ? new MultiPolygon(flatCoordinates, 'XY', endss)
        : new Polygon(flatCoordinates, 'XY', ends);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a check for when `ends` is null or undefined. In such cases, it creates a simple Polygon without trying to process the ends. This prevents the creation of additional polygon shapes that could be causing the unwanted semi-transparent layer.

The issue occurs because when rendering vector tiles with polygons, sometimes the geometry data doesn't have properly defined "ends" for the polygon rings, which can lead to incorrect rendering when applying fill styles. By handling this case explicitly, we ensure that the polygon is rendered correctly with the fill style applied only to the actual geometry.
