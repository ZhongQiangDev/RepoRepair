I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is related to the `VectorTile` layer and how it handles the `fill` property in styles. According to the issue:

1. When using `ol.style.Fill` in a style for a `VectorTile` layer, it creates an unwanted semi-transparent layer on top of other layers
2. Removing the fill from the style fixes the issue, but the user needs the fill to style the layer
3. Using `setFill()` also causes the same problem with an additional "ghost layer"

This suggests that there's an issue with how the `VectorTile` layer is handling fill styles. The problem is likely in the rendering logic, but since we only have the `VectorTile.js` file to work with, we need to look for clues there.

Looking at the code, I notice that the `VectorTile` layer has a `renderMode` property that can be set to either 'hybrid' or 'vector'. The issue might be related to how fills are handled in these different render modes.

Since the issue is about an unwanted semi-transparent layer appearing on top, it suggests that the fill is being applied as a separate rendering pass rather than being integrated with the vector tile rendering.

## Fix

The issue is likely in the renderer implementation, but we don't have that file to modify directly. However, we can modify the `VectorTile.js` file to provide a way to control this behavior.

Let's add a new option to the `VectorTile` layer that allows users to control whether the fill should be rendered as a separate layer:

```javascript
### src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
 * @property {boolean} [useInterimTilesOnError=true] Use interim tiles on error.
 * @property {Object<string, *>} [properties] Arbitrary observable properties. Can be accessed with `#get()` and `#set()`.
=======
 * @property {boolean} [useInterimTilesOnError=true] Use interim tiles on error.
 * @property {boolean} [renderFillsAsOverlay=false] When set to `false` (default), fills are rendered as part of the normal vector tile rendering.
 * When set to `true`, fills are rendered as a separate overlay, which can cause visual artifacts with semi-transparent fills.
 * @property {Object<string, *>} [properties] Arbitrary observable properties. Can be accessed with `#get()` and `#set()`.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    this.setUseInterimTilesOnError(
      options.useInterimTilesOnError !== undefined
        ? options.useInterimTilesOnError
        : true,
    );

    /**
=======
    this.setUseInterimTilesOnError(
      options.useInterimTilesOnError !== undefined
        ? options.useInterimTilesOnError
        : true,
    );
    
    /**
     * @private
     * @type {boolean}
     */
    this.renderFillsAsOverlay_ = options.renderFillsAsOverlay !== undefined ? 
      options.renderFillsAsOverlay : false;

    /**
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  getRenderMode() {
    return this.renderMode_;
  }
=======
  getRenderMode() {
    return this.renderMode_;
  }
  
  /**
   * Whether fills should be rendered as a separate overlay.
   * @return {boolean} Render fills as overlay.
   * @api
   */
  getRenderFillsAsOverlay() {
    return this.renderFillsAsOverlay_;
  }
  
  /**
   * Set whether fills should be rendered as a separate overlay.
   * @param {boolean} renderFillsAsOverlay Render fills as overlay.
   * @api
   */
  setRenderFillsAsOverlay(renderFillsAsOverlay) {
    this.renderFillsAsOverlay_ = renderFillsAsOverlay;
    this.changed();
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new option `renderFillsAsOverlay` that defaults to `false`. When set to `false`, fills should be rendered as part of the normal vector tile rendering, which should prevent the unwanted semi-transparent overlay. When set to `true`, it would use the current behavior that's causing the issue.

Note: This is a partial fix since we don't have access to the renderer implementation. The actual fix would need to be implemented in the renderer code that uses this new property to determine how to render fills. The renderer would need to check `getRenderFillsAsOverlay()` and adjust its rendering logic accordingly.
