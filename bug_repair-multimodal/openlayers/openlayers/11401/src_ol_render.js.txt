I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is related to hit detection and rendering when an icon has a negative scale. According to the issue description:
1. When the scale is negative and rotation is 0, hit detection doesn't work
2. The icon is not rendered at the edge of the map

Looking at the code, the problem is likely in how transformations are applied. When a negative scale is used, the transformation matrix needs to be properly handled to ensure both hit detection and rendering work correctly.

The issue is in the `toContext` function in `src/ol/render.js`. When creating the transform, it's only applying the pixel ratio as a scale factor, but it's not considering negative scales that might be applied elsewhere in the rendering pipeline.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/render.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const transform = scaleTransform(createTransform(), pixelRatio, pixelRatio);
  return new CanvasImmediateRenderer(context, pixelRatio, extent, transform, 0);
=======
  const transform = scaleTransform(createTransform(), pixelRatio, pixelRatio);
  return new CanvasImmediateRenderer(context, pixelRatio, extent, transform, 0);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The issue isn't directly visible in the provided code snippet. The problem is likely in the `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class or in how icon rendering is handled with negative scales. Since we don't have access to those files, I'll provide a more general explanation of what needs to be fixed:

The issue is related to how transformations are applied when rendering icons with negative scales. When an icon has a negative scale, the transformation matrix needs to properly account for this to ensure:

1. Hit detection works correctly - The hit detection code needs to properly transform coordinates when checking if a point is inside the icon, even with negative scales.
2. Rendering at map edges - The clipping logic needs to properly handle negative scales to ensure icons are partially rendered when they're at the edge of the map.

Without seeing the specific implementation of the icon rendering and hit detection code, I can't provide an exact fix. However, the solution would involve ensuring that all transformation operations properly handle negative scale values, particularly in:

1. The hit detection logic for icons
2. The clipping/rendering logic for icons at map edges

The developers should check how transformations are applied in these areas and ensure that negative scale values are properly accounted for in the transformation matrices.
