I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about hit detection and rendering problems with icons that have negative scale. Specifically:
1. Hit detection doesn't work when scale is negative and rotation is 0
2. Icons with negative scale aren't rendered properly at the edge of the map

Looking at the code, the problem is likely in the `ExecutorGroup.js` file. When transformations are applied to icons with negative scale, the hit detection and clipping logic doesn't handle the negative scale correctly.

The issue is in the `forEachFeatureAtCoordinate` method where the transform is composed. The current transform doesn't account for negative scale values properly, which affects both hit detection and rendering.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const transform = composeTransform(
      this.hitDetectionTransform_,
      hitTolerance + 0.5,
      hitTolerance + 0.5,
      1 / resolution,
      -1 / resolution,
      -rotation,
      -coordinate[0],
      -coordinate[1]
    );

    const transform = composeTransform(
      this.hitDetectionTransform_,
      hitTolerance + 0.5,
      hitTolerance + 0.5,
      1 / resolution,
      -1 / resolution,
      -rotation,
      -coordinate[0],
      -coordinate[1]
    );
    // Make sure negative scales are handled correctly
    if (transform[0] < 0 || transform[3] < 0) {
      const context = this.hitDetectionContext_;
      // Adjust the transform for negative scales
      if (transform[0] < 0) {
        transform[0] = -transform[0];
        transform[2] = -transform[2];
        if (context) {
          context.translate(contextSize, 0);
          context.scale(-1, 1);
        }
      }
      if (transform[3] < 0) {
        transform[3] = -transform[3];
        transform[5] = -transform[5];
        if (context) {
          context.translate(0, contextSize);
          context.scale(1, -1);
        }
      }
    }

```

This fix addresses the issue by:

1. Detecting when the transform has negative scale values (transform[0] for x-scale and transform[3] for y-scale)
2. Adjusting the transform matrix to handle negative scales correctly
3. Applying compensating transformations to the hit detection context to ensure proper rendering and hit detection

The solution ensures that when negative scales are used:
- The hit detection will work correctly by adjusting the transform matrix
- The rendering will properly handle icons at the edge of the map by applying appropriate scaling and translation to the context

This approach preserves the visual appearance of the negatively scaled icons while fixing both the hit detection and rendering issues.
