I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about adding support for reading a feature's ID in style expressions. Currently, style expressions can access feature properties using `['get', 'attributeName']`, but there's no way to access the feature ID (`feature.getId()`).

The user wants to avoid duplicating the ID in both the root of the GeoJSON feature and in its properties collection.

## Solution

We need to add a new expression operator that can read a feature's ID. Looking at the code, we can see that `Feature.js` defines the `getId()` method, but there's no corresponding expression operator in the style expression system.

Since the issue doesn't include the style expression code, I'll need to create a new operator that can be added to the appropriate file. Based on the naming convention mentioned in the issue (`['get', 'attributeName']`), we should add a new operator like `['id']` to access the feature ID.

However, since the issue doesn't include the file where style expressions are defined, I can't provide a direct edit for that file. Instead, I'll recommend what needs to be added:

1. A new expression operator (likely named `'id'`) should be added to the style expression system
2. This operator should call `feature.getId()` when evaluated

Since I don't have access to the style expression code, I can't provide a specific *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit for it. The repository maintainers would need to:

1. Locate the file that defines style expressions (likely in a directory like `src/ol/style/expressions/` or similar)
2. Add a new case for the `'id'` operator that returns `feature.getId()`

Without seeing the actual style expression code, I can't provide a more specific edit. The maintainers would need to implement this based on how their expression system is structured.
