I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about adding support for reading a feature's ID in style expressions. Currently, style expressions can access feature properties using `['get', 'attributeName']`, but there's no equivalent for accessing `feature.getId()`. The user wants to avoid duplicating the ID in both the root of the GeoJSON feature and in its properties collection.

Looking at the code, we need to add a new expression operator that can retrieve a feature's ID, similar to how the 'get' operator retrieves properties.

## Solution

We need to add a new expression type to the documentation in `src/ol/style/flat.js`. The best place to add this is in the documentation for expression types, specifically where the `StringExpression` and other expression types are defined.

```javascript
### src/ol/style/flat.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * A literal string (e.g. `'hello'`) or an expression that evaluates to a string (e.g. `['get', 'greeting']`).
 *
 * @typedef {string|Array} StringExpression
 */
=======
/**
 * A literal string (e.g. `'hello'`) or an expression that evaluates to a string (e.g. `['get', 'greeting']`).
 * To access a feature's id, use `['id']`.
 *
 * @typedef {string|Array} StringExpression
 */
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds documentation for the new `['id']` expression operator that will allow users to access a feature's ID in style expressions. The actual implementation of this operator would need to be added in the code that evaluates expressions, but that's not shown in the provided file.

Note: This is just the documentation change. The actual implementation would require modifying the expression evaluation logic elsewhere in the codebase to handle the new `['id']` operator. The implementation would need to call `feature.getId()` when it encounters this operator.
