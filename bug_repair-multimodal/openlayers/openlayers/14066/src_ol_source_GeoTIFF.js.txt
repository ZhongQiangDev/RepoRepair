I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is requesting support for a `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option for GeoTIFF sources. Currently, the code only supports a boolean value for `convertToRGB` (true or false), which determines whether to use the `readRGB` method or the `readRasters` method when reading GeoTIFF data.

The requested enhancement would allow an 'auto' setting that would intelligently choose between these methods based on the photometric interpretation of the source (CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab).

## Solution

I need to modify the code to:
1. Update the `Options` type definition to include 'auto' as a possible value for `convertToRGB`
2. Add logic to determine the appropriate read method based on the photometric interpretation when 'auto' is specified

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
 * @typedef {Object} Options
 * @property {Array<SourceInfo>} sources List of information about GeoTIFF sources.
 * Multiple sources can be combined when their resolution sets are equal after applying a scale.
 * The list of sources defines a mapping between input bands as they are read from each GeoTIFF and
 * the output bands that are provided by data tiles. To control which bands to read from each GeoTIFF,
 * use the {@link import("./GeoTIFF.js").SourceInfo bands} property. If, for example, you specify two
 * sources, one with 3 bands and {@link import("./GeoTIFF.js").SourceInfo nodata} configured, and
 * another with 1 band, the resulting data tiles will have 5 bands: 3 from the first source, 1 alpha
 * band from the first source, and 1 band from the second source.
 * @property {GeoTIFFSourceOptions} [sourceOptions] Additional options to be passed to [geotiff.js](https://geotiffjs.github.io/geotiff.js/module-geotiff.html)'s `fromUrl` or `fromUrls` methods.
 * @property {boolean} [convertToRGB = false] By default, bands from the sources are read as-is. When
 * reading GeoTIFFs with the purpose of displaying them as RGB images, setting this to `true` will
 * convert other color spaces (YCbCr, CMYK) to RGB.

These changes:
1. Update the type definition to include 'auto' as a possible value for convertToRGB
2. Store the original convertToRGB option value for later use
3. Add logic to determine the appropriate read method when 'auto' is specified, based on the photometric interpretation of the image

The implementation checks if the image has 3 samples per pixel and if the photometric interpretation is one of the specified types (CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab), and uses readRGB in those cases.
