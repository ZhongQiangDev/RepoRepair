I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue occurs when the browser is zoomed (e.g., at 150%) and vector tiles are rendered with `renderMode: 'image'`. The problem manifests as visible clipping between adjacent tiles, as shown in the GIF.

Looking at the `VectorRenderTile.js` file, I can see that when creating canvas contexts for rendering tiles, the code is using a fixed size of 1x1 pixels:

```javascript
this.context_[key] = createCanvasContext2D(1, 1, canvasPool);
```

This is likely the source of the problem. When the browser is zoomed, the canvas needs to account for the device pixel ratio to ensure proper rendering without clipping artifacts.

## Solution

We need to modify the canvas creation to account for the device pixel ratio. This will ensure that the canvas has enough resolution when the browser is zoomed.

```javascript
### src/ol/VectorRenderTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  getContext(layer) {
    const key = getUid(layer);
    if (!(key in this.context_)) {
      this.context_[key] = createCanvasContext2D(1, 1, canvasPool);
    }
    return this.context_[key];
  }
=======
  getContext(layer) {
    const key = getUid(layer);
    if (!(key in this.context_)) {
      // Use device pixel ratio to ensure proper rendering when browser is zoomed
      const pixelRatio = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
      this.context_[key] = createCanvasContext2D(pixelRatio, pixelRatio, canvasPool);
    }
    return this.context_[key];
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when creating a new canvas context, we account for the device pixel ratio, which is higher when the browser is zoomed (e.g., 1.5 for 150% zoom). This should prevent the clipping issues between tiles by ensuring the canvas has sufficient resolution.
