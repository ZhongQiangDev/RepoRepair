I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue states that the `className` setting in `ol.layer.HeatMap` does not work. When customizing the className of the heatmap, it doesn't work, and the default className is not displayed on the page.

Looking at the code, I can see that the `Heatmap` class extends `VectorLayer`, and the `className` option is documented in the JSDoc comments. However, the issue is that while the option is documented, the code doesn't actually pass the className to the renderer.

The problem is in the `createRenderer` method of the `Heatmap` class. This method creates a `WebGLPointsLayerRenderer` but doesn't pass the className to it. The renderer needs to know the className to apply it to the DOM elements it creates.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  createRenderer() {
    return new WebGLPointsLayerRenderer(this, {
      attributes: [
        {
          name: 'weight',
          callback: function (feature) {
            const weight = this.weightFunction_(feature);
            return weight !== undefined ? clamp(weight, 0, 1) : 1;
          }.bind(this),
        },
      ],
=======
  createRenderer() {
    return new WebGLPointsLayerRenderer(this, {
      className: this.getClassName(),
      attributes: [
        {
          name: 'weight',
          callback: function (feature) {
            const weight = this.weightFunction_(feature);
            return weight !== undefined ? clamp(weight, 0, 1) : 1;
          }.bind(this),
        },
      ],
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the `className` property to the options object passed to the `WebGLPointsLayerRenderer` constructor. It uses the `getClassName()` method which is inherited from the parent class to get the current className value. This ensures that the className setting will be properly applied to the heatmap layer's DOM elements.
