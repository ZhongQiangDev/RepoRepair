I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue occurs when using an Icon style with a custom color on a display with a pixel ratio > 1. The offset of the icon is incorrect in this specific case.

Looking at the code and the issue description, I can see that the problem was introduced in OpenLayers 6.4.0 by PR #11277. The issue happens because:

1. When a custom color is applied to an icon, the image is redrawn with that color
2. The imagePixelRatio_ is used to scale various parameters for high-DPI displays
3. The bug is in how the anchor points are being calculated in the drawPoint and drawMultiPoint methods

The problem is that in the instructions for drawing the image, the anchor points are being multiplied by imagePixelRatio_ but this is incorrect when the image has already been scaled for high-DPI displays.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/ImageBuilder.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      this.anchorX_ * this.imagePixelRatio_,
      this.anchorY_ * this.imagePixelRatio_,
=======
      this.anchorX_,
      this.anchorY_,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix needs to be applied in both the `drawPoint` and `drawMultiPoint` methods. Here's the second occurrence:

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/ImageBuilder.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      this.anchorX_ * this.imagePixelRatio_,
      this.anchorY_ * this.imagePixelRatio_,
=======
      this.anchorX_,
      this.anchorY_,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The issue is that the anchor points are being incorrectly scaled by the imagePixelRatio_ in the instructions. The anchor points should be used as-is, without this additional scaling, because the scaling is already handled elsewhere in the rendering pipeline. This is why the issue only appears when using a custom color (which triggers the creation of a new image) and when the pixel ratio is not 1.

By removing the multiplication by imagePixelRatio_, the anchor points will be correctly positioned regardless of the pixel ratio or whether a custom color is applied to the icon.
