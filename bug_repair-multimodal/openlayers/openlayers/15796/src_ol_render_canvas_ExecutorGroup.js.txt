I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that VectorLayers with both `declutter: true` and `opacity < 1` are not clearing properly between renders, causing a "ghosting" effect where previous renders remain visible when panning the map.

Looking at the code, I notice that the `NON_DECLUTTER` array is defined but its filter function is empty. This array should contain all builder types that are not in the `DECLUTTER` array. The `DECLUTTER` array contains 'Image' and 'Text' types.

The issue is likely related to how decluttered layers with opacity are being handled during rendering. When a layer has opacity < 1, the canvas needs to be properly cleared between renders to prevent the accumulation of semi-transparent elements.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const NON_DECLUTTER = ALL.filter(

);
=======
export const NON_DECLUTTER = ALL.filter(
  (builderType) => !DECLUTTER.includes(builderType)
);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix properly defines the `NON_DECLUTTER` array to include all builder types that are not in the `DECLUTTER` array. This ensures that the rendering system correctly identifies which elements need special handling for decluttering.

The empty filter function was causing the `NON_DECLUTTER` array to be empty, which likely affected how the rendering system determined which elements to clear between renders when opacity was less than 1.

By properly filtering the builder types, the rendering system can now correctly handle the clearing of semi-transparent decluttered layers between renders, preventing the ghosting effect observed when panning the map.
