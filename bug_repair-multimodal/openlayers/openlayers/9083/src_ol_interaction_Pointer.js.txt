I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that after drawing a polygon in OpenLayers 5.3.0, the map sometimes can't be dragged anymore. This only happens after ending a drawing (drawend event), and the behavior is inconsistent. The user mentioned that rolling back to OpenLayers 4.6.5 fixed the issue.

Looking at the provided code from `src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js`, I can see a potential issue in the `handleEvent` method. When handling a pointer up event during a drag sequence, the code sets `handlingDownUpSequence` based on both the return value of `handleUpEvent` and whether there are still target pointers:

```javascript
const handledUp = this.handleUpEvent(mapBrowserEvent);
this.handlingDownUpSequence = handledUp && this.targetPointers.length > 0;
```

The problem is that after drawing a polygon and completing it (on pointer up), the `handlingDownUpSequence` flag might remain true if `handleUpEvent` returns true and there are still tracked pointers. This would prevent new drag operations from starting because the code thinks it's still in a drag sequence.

## Fix

The issue is in how the `handlingDownUpSequence` flag is updated. We need to ensure that when a pointer up event occurs, the drag sequence is properly terminated if `handleUpEvent` returns false, regardless of the number of target pointers.

```javascript
### src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        const handledUp = this.handleUpEvent(mapBrowserEvent);
        this.handlingDownUpSequence = handledUp && this.targetPointers.length > 0;
=======
        const handledUp = this.handleUpEvent(mapBrowserEvent);
        this.handlingDownUpSequence = handledUp;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when `handleUpEvent` returns false (indicating the drag sequence should end), the `handlingDownUpSequence` flag is properly set to false, allowing new drag operations to start. The original code was incorrectly keeping the drag sequence active if there were still target pointers, even when `handleUpEvent` indicated the sequence should end.

This fix aligns with the behavior in OpenLayers 4.6.5, where the issue doesn't occur, and should resolve the problem of not being able to drag the map after completing a polygon drawing.
