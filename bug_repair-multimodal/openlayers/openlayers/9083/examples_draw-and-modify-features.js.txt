I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue describes a problem where after drawing a polygon in OpenLayers 5.3.0, the map sometimes can't be dragged anymore. This only happens after ending a drawing (drawend event), and the issue doesn't occur in OpenLayers 4.6.5.

Looking at the code, I notice that the example creates a Draw interaction but doesn't handle any cleanup after the drawing is completed. In OpenLayers 5.3.0, there appears to be a bug where the Draw interaction might still capture some pointer events even after the drawing is completed, preventing the map from being dragged.

## Solution

We need to properly handle the `drawend` event to ensure the map can be dragged after drawing is completed. The fix is to listen for the `drawend` event and ensure the interaction is properly reset.

```javascript
### examples/draw-and-modify-features.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function addInteractions() {
  draw = new Draw({
    source: source,
    type: typeSelect.value
  });
  map.addInteraction(draw);
  snap = new Snap({source: source});
  map.addInteraction(snap);

}
=======
function addInteractions() {
  draw = new Draw({
    source: source,
    type: typeSelect.value
  });
  
  // Add listener for drawend to ensure map can be dragged after drawing
  draw.on('drawend', function() {
    // Small delay to ensure all internal states are reset
    setTimeout(function() {
      // Re-add the interaction to reset its state
      map.removeInteraction(draw);
      map.addInteraction(draw);
    }, 0);
  });
  
  map.addInteraction(draw);
  snap = new Snap({source: source});
  map.addInteraction(snap);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds an event listener to the `drawend` event. When a drawing is completed, it removes and re-adds the Draw interaction after a minimal timeout. This ensures that any internal state in the Draw interaction that might be preventing map dragging is properly reset.

The timeout of 0ms is used to ensure the reset happens after the current event loop cycle completes, which allows any pending events to be processed first.
