I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about inconsistent rendering of offset and rotated text between vector layers and vector context. According to the issue description:

1. The vector layer renderer rotates offset text around the feature from which it is offset.
2. The immediate renderer rotates text around its offset anchor point (as defined by the `textAlign` and `textBaseline` settings).

This inconsistency becomes apparent when both offset and rotation are applied to text.

Looking at the code, the issue is likely in the `Builder.js` file, which handles the rendering instructions for vector features. The problem is that the rotation behavior differs between the two rendering paths.

## Solution

After examining the code, I don't see any direct handling of text rotation in the provided file. The issue is likely in how text positioning and rotation are handled in the rendering pipeline.

Since the issue mentions that the vector layer renderer (which is the correct behavior according to the issue) rotates text around the feature point rather than the offset anchor point, we need to ensure consistent behavior between both renderers.

Based on the issue description, no code changes are needed in the provided file. The fix would need to be in the immediate renderer code that handles text rotation, which is not part of the provided code.

However, if you'd like me to provide a more specific fix, I would need to see the code that handles text rendering in the immediate renderer, particularly the parts that handle text positioning, offsetting, and rotation.

Without seeing that code, I cannot provide a specific search/replace edit to fix the issue.
