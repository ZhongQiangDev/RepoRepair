I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when `declutter` is enabled on a Vector Layer and `setOpacity` is called on that layer, the layer disappears. This happens in OpenLayers v9.0.

Looking at the code, I notice that the `NON_DECLUTTER` constant is defined but its implementation is incomplete. It's supposed to filter out the declutter types from the `ALL` array, but the filter function is empty.

This is important because when opacity is changed on a layer with decluttering enabled, the rendering system needs to know which builder types should be rendered normally and which should be handled with decluttering.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const NON_DECLUTTER = ALL.filter(

);
=======
export const NON_DECLUTTER = ALL.filter(
  (builderType) => !DECLUTTER.includes(builderType)
);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix properly implements the `NON_DECLUTTER` constant by filtering out the builder types that are in the `DECLUTTER` array from the `ALL` array. This ensures that when opacity is changed on a layer with decluttering enabled, the rendering system correctly identifies which builder types should be rendered normally and which should be handled with decluttering.

The issue occurs because without this filter implementation, the `NON_DECLUTTER` array is empty, and when opacity changes, the layer's rendering logic can't properly determine which elements to render, causing the entire layer to disappear.
