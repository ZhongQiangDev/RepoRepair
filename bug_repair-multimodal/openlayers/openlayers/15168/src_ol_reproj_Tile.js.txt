I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about raster reprojection in OpenLayers. When reprojecting a raster image from one projection to another, OpenLayers is assuming that the target pixels should be square, which causes misalignment. The user's 5×5 source image is being displayed as a 7×5 image in the target projection because OpenLayers is trying to maintain square pixels rather than preserving the original pixel count and allowing non-square pixels in the reprojected result.

Looking at the code in `src/ol/reproj/Tile.js`, the issue is in the `reproject_()` method. When rendering the reprojected tile, it's using the target tile size as a square, but it should maintain the aspect ratio of the source pixels when projected to the target projection.

The bug is specifically in how the canvas dimensions are determined for the reprojected tile. The code is using the tile size from the target tile grid, but it's not accounting for the potential stretching or compression that should happen during reprojection.

## Fix

The fix should modify the `reproject_()` method to allow non-square pixels in the reprojected result. We need to adjust how the width and height of the canvas are determined.

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      const z = this.wrappedTileCoord_[0];
      const size = this.targetTileGrid_.getTileSize(z);
      const width = typeof size === 'number' ? size : size[0];
      const height = typeof size === 'number' ? size : size[1];
      const targetResolution = this.targetTileGrid_.getResolution(z);
      const sourceResolution = this.sourceTileGrid_.getResolution(
        this.sourceZ_
      );

      const targetExtent = this.targetTileGrid_.getTileCoordExtent(
        this.wrappedTileCoord_
      );
=======
      const z = this.wrappedTileCoord_[0];
      const size = this.targetTileGrid_.getTileSize(z);
      const width = typeof size === 'number' ? size : size[0];
      const height = typeof size === 'number' ? size : size[1];
      const targetResolution = this.targetTileGrid_.getResolution(z);
      const sourceResolution = this.sourceTileGrid_.getResolution(
        this.sourceZ_
      );

      const targetExtent = this.targetTileGrid_.getTileCoordExtent(
        this.wrappedTileCoord_
      );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After reviewing the code more carefully, I see that the issue is not in the `reproject_()` method of the `ReprojTile` class, but rather in the `render` function from the `reproj.js` module that's being called. The `renderReprojected` function is where the actual reprojection happens, and it's likely assuming square pixels.

Since we don't have access to the `reproj.js` file in the provided code, I need to modify my approach. The issue is likely in how the triangulation and rendering is done in that file. 

Let me provide a more general recommendation:

The fix would need to modify the `renderReprojected` function in `src/ol/reproj.js` to:

1. Calculate the appropriate width and height for the target canvas based on the source pixel dimensions and the transformation between projections
2. Allow for non-square pixels in the reprojected result
3. Ensure that the number of pixels in the source and target match

Without seeing the `reproj.js` file, I can't provide a specific search/replace edit. The OpenLayers team would need to modify the reprojection algorithm to preserve the source pixel count and allow for non-square pixels in the target projection.
