I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about raster reprojection in OpenLayers. When reprojecting a raster image from one projection to another, OpenLayers is assuming that the target pixels should be square, which causes misalignment. The user's example shows a 5×5 image being reprojected, but the result looks like a 7×5 image because some source pixels are repeated to maintain square target pixels.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `renderReprojected` function that's called in the `reproject_` method of `ReprojDataTile`. This function is responsible for rendering the reprojected image, but it's not preserving the aspect ratio of the source pixels when projecting them.

The issue is that when the `renderReprojected` function is called, it's not being told to preserve the original pixel aspect ratio. The function is being called with parameters that force it to create square pixels in the target projection.

## Fix

We need to modify the call to `renderReprojected` to ensure it preserves the original pixel aspect ratio during reprojection. The key is to add a parameter that tells the function to preserve the source pixel shape rather than forcing square pixels in the output.

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        const canvas = renderReprojected(
          targetWidth,
          targetHeight,
          this.pixelRatio_,
          sourceResolution,
          this.sourceTileGrid_.getExtent(),
          targetResolution,
          targetExtent,
          this.triangulation_,
          sources,
          this.gutter_,
          false,
          false
        );

        const canvas = renderReprojected(
          targetWidth,
          targetHeight,
          this.pixelRatio_,
          sourceResolution,
          this.sourceTileGrid_.getExtent(),
          targetResolution,
          targetExtent,
          this.triangulation_,
          sources,
          this.gutter_,
          false,
          false,
          true  // preserveAspectRatio - preserve the aspect ratio of source pixels
        );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new parameter to the `renderReprojected` function call. The parameter `preserveAspectRatio` is set to `true`, which tells the function to maintain the aspect ratio of the source pixels when projecting them to the target projection.

Note: This fix assumes that the `renderReprojected` function in `../reproj.js` already supports this parameter. If it doesn't, additional changes would be needed in that file to implement the aspect ratio preservation logic. Since we don't have access to that file in this context, I'm assuming it either already supports this parameter or will be modified to support it.
