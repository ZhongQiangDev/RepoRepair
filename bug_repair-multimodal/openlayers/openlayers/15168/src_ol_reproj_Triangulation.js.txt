I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about raster reprojection in OpenLayers. When reprojecting a raster image from one projection to another, OpenLayers is assuming that the projected pixels should be square, which causes misalignment. The user's 5×5 image is being displayed as a 7×5 image after reprojection, with some pixels being duplicated.

The problem is in the triangulation process used for reprojection. The current implementation doesn't account for the fact that pixels might need to be non-square in the target projection to maintain the correct alignment with the source data.

Looking at the code in `src/ol/reproj/Triangulation.js`, the issue is likely in how the triangulation is performed. The code currently subdivides quadrilaterals based on error thresholds, but doesn't consider the aspect ratio of the resulting pixels.

## Fix

The key issue is that the triangulation algorithm needs to be modified to better preserve the aspect ratio of the source pixels in the target projection. The current implementation splits quadrilaterals either horizontally or vertically based on which dimension is larger, but it doesn't consider the aspect ratio of the source pixels.

Here's the fix:

```

This fix changes how the algorithm decides whether to split a quadrilateral horizontally or vertically during subdivision. Instead of just comparing the target coordinates, it now calculates aspect ratios in both source and target coordinates and makes the split decision based on the relationship between these aspect ratios.

The key improvement is that it now considers the shape of the source pixels when deciding how to subdivide, which helps preserve the correct aspect ratio during reprojection. This should prevent the issue where a 5×5 source image appears as a 7×5 image after reprojection, as the algorithm will now better maintain the proportions of the original pixels.
