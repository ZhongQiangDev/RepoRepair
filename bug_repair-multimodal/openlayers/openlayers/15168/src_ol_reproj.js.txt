I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about raster reprojection in OpenLayers. When reprojecting a raster image from one projection to another, OpenLayers is trying to maintain square pixels in the target projection, which causes misalignment. The user's 5×5 image with 3km by 2km pixels is being displayed as a 7×5 image after reprojection.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `render` function in `src/ol/reproj.js`. The issue is related to how the source resolution is calculated and applied when drawing the reprojected image. The current implementation assumes that pixels should be square in the target projection, but this doesn't preserve the original pixel count.

The key issue is in the `context.scale()` call near the end of the `render` function, where it applies the same scale factor in both x and y directions:

```javascript
context.scale(
  sourceResolution / pixelRatio,
  -sourceResolution / pixelRatio
);
```

This assumes square pixels. Instead, we need to account for the different aspect ratios between source and target projections.

## Fix

We need to modify the scaling to account for the different aspect ratios in the source and target projections. Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    context.scale(
      sourceResolution / pixelRatio,
      -sourceResolution / pixelRatio
    );
=======
    // Calculate separate scale factors for X and Y to preserve the source pixel dimensions
    const sourceWidth = getWidth(sourceDataExtent);
    const sourceHeight = getHeight(sourceDataExtent);
    const sourcePixelWidth = stitchContext.canvas.width / pixelRatio;
    const sourcePixelHeight = stitchContext.canvas.height / pixelRatio;
    
    const scaleX = (sourceWidth / sourcePixelWidth) / pixelRatio;
    const scaleY = (sourceHeight / sourcePixelHeight) / pixelRatio;
    
    context.scale(scaleX, -scaleY);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change calculates separate scale factors for the X and Y dimensions based on the actual dimensions of the source data extent and the pixel dimensions of the stitched canvas. This ensures that the aspect ratio of the source pixels is preserved during reprojection, which should fix the issue where a 5×5 image is displayed as a 7×5 image.
