I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is occurring in the OpenLayers library when using reprojected tile layers. When zooming in and out, white areas appear on the map because some tiles have been disposed (marked as ABORT state) and are excluded from the reprojection process.

The issue description mentions that simply including tiles in the ABORT state doesn't work properly. The problem is likely in the `ol/reproj.js` file, specifically in the function that renders reprojected data from source tiles.

Looking at the provided code snippets, I can see parts of the `reproj.js` file, but the actual implementation of the rendering function is not fully shown. The issue is likely in the part that decides which tiles to include in the reprojection process.

Since the issue description mentions that tiles in the ABORT state are being excluded, we need to modify the code to handle these tiles differently - either by preventing them from being disposed prematurely or by ensuring they're properly refetched when needed.

## Fix

Since we don't see the complete implementation in the provided code, I'll need to make an educated guess about where the issue might be. Based on the issue description, it's likely in the function that renders reprojected data from source tiles, which should be in the `reproj.js` file.

The issue is likely in the part where it filters out tiles that are in certain states. We need to modify this to handle ABORT state tiles appropriately.

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
 * @param {boolean=} opt_renderEdges Render reprojection edges.
 * @return {HTMLCanvasElement} Canvas with reprojected data.
 */

=======
 * @param {boolean=} opt_renderEdges Render reprojection edges.
 * @return {HTMLCanvasElement} Canvas with reprojected data.
 */

/**
 * @typedef {Object} SourceInfo
 * @property {import("./extent.js").Extent} extent Extent of the tile.
 * @property {HTMLCanvasElement|HTMLImageElement|HTMLVideoElement} image Image element.
 * @property {boolean} [loaded] The source is loaded and ready to be used.
 */

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This is just a first step to add a proper type definition for the source objects. However, without seeing the actual implementation of the rendering function, it's difficult to provide a complete fix.

Let me try a more general approach based on the issue description:

```javascript
### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  for (let i = 0, ii = this.sourceTiles.length; i < ii; ++i) {
    const sourceTile = this.sourceTiles[i];
    if (sourceTile.getState() == TileState.LOADED) {
      sources.push({
        extent: sourceTileExtent,
        image: sourceTile.getImage()
      });
    }
  }
=======
  for (let i = 0, ii = this.sourceTiles.length; i < ii; ++i) {
    const sourceTile = this.sourceTiles[i];
    // Include tiles that are LOADED or were previously loaded but are now ABORT
    // This prevents white areas when tiles have been disposed but are still needed
    if (sourceTile.getState() == TileState.LOADED || 
        (sourceTile.getState() == TileState.ABORT && sourceTile.getImage())) {
      sources.push({
        extent: sourceTileExtent,
        image: sourceTile.getImage()
      });
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix assumes that the issue is in the `reproj/Tile.js` file where it collects source tiles for reprojection. The fix modifies the condition to include tiles that are in the ABORT state but still have a valid image that can be used for reprojection.

Note: Without seeing the complete code, this is my best guess at a fix. The actual implementation might be different, and the fix might need to be adjusted accordingly.
