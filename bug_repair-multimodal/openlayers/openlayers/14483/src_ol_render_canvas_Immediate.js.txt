I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about rotated vector layer text styles not displaying at the correct location when the context is clipped and translated. According to the issue description:

1. When using a spyglass effect that translates vector layers, rotated text styles appear at the original location instead of the translated location.
2. Non-rotated text styles work correctly and appear at the translated location.
3. This only happens when the text style has a non-zero rotation value.

Looking at the code in `src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js`, the issue is likely in the `drawText_` method. When drawing rotated text, the code is not properly accounting for the translation that has already been applied to the context.

## Fix

The problem is in the `drawText_` method. When rotation is applied, the code is using `context.translate()` and `context.rotate()` operations that don't properly account for the existing transformation. The issue is that when text is rotated, the code is resetting the transformation matrix after drawing, which loses the translation that was applied by the spyglass effect.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      if (
        rotation !== 0 ||
        this.textScale_[0] != 1 ||
        this.textScale_[1] != 1
      ) {
        context.translate(x - this.textOffsetX_, y - this.textOffsetY_);
        context.rotate(rotation);
        context.translate(this.textOffsetX_, this.textOffsetY_);
        context.scale(this.textScale_[0], this.textScale_[1]);
        if (this.textStrokeState_) {
          context.strokeText(this.text_, 0, 0);
        }
        if (this.textFillState_) {
          context.fillText(this.text_, 0, 0);
        }
        context.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0);

        rotation !== 0 ||
        this.textScale_[0] != 1 ||
        this.textScale_[1] != 1
      ) {
        const currentTransform = context.getTransform();
        context.translate(x - this.textOffsetX_, y - this.textOffsetY_);
        context.rotate(rotation);
        context.translate(this.textOffsetX_, this.textOffsetY_);
        context.scale(this.textScale_[0], this.textScale_[1]);
        if (this.textStrokeState_) {
          context.strokeText(this.text_, 0, 0);
        }
        if (this.textFillState_) {
          context.fillText(this.text_, 0, 0);
        }
        context.setTransform(currentTransform);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix saves the current transformation matrix before applying the rotation and scaling operations, then restores it after drawing the text. This preserves any existing transformations (like the translation applied by the spyglass effect) while still allowing the text to be rotated correctly.

The key change is replacing `context.setTransform(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)` (which resets to the identity matrix, losing all transformations) with `context.setTransform(currentTransform)` (which restores the transformation that was in effect before the rotation was applied).
