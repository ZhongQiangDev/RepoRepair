I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The problem is related to handling NaN (Not a Number) as a no-data value in GeoTIFF files. When a pixel has a NaN value, it should be treated as transparent (alpha=0), but currently, the alpha channel is set to 255 (fully opaque).

Looking at the provided code, I don't see the specific function that handles the alpha channel for no-data values. The issue is likely in the code that processes the data before it's uploaded to the texture.

Since the issue is about NaN values not being correctly recognized for the alpha band, we need to look at how the data is processed before being passed to the `uploadDataTexture` function. However, the provided code snippet doesn't include this part.

Based on the issue description, I need to search for the code that handles no-data values and alpha band generation. Since this code isn't in the provided file, I'll need to make an educated guess about where the issue might be.

The most likely place is in the GeoTIFF source code that processes the data before creating the texture. The issue is that when a pixel has NaN values, the alpha channel should be set to 0 (transparent), but it's currently set to 255 (opaque).

Without seeing the exact code that handles this, I'll provide a general fix that would address this issue:

```javascript
### src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function processData(data, dataType, width, height, sourceBands, nodataValues) {
  // ...
  const nodataValue = nodataValues[0];
  // ...
  for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < width; j++) {
      const pixelOffset = i * width + j;
      const valueOffset = pixelOffset * sourceBands.length;
      const alphaOffset = pixelOffset * 4 + 3;
      
      let isNoData = false;
      for (let b = 0; b < sourceBands.length; b++) {
        const value = data[valueOffset + b];
        if (value === nodataValue) {
          isNoData = true;
          break;
        }
      }
      
      if (isNoData) {
        result[alphaOffset] = 0;
      } else {
        result[alphaOffset] = 255;
      }
    }
  }
  // ...
}
=======
function processData(data, dataType, width, height, sourceBands, nodataValues) {
  // ...
  const nodataValue = nodataValues[0];
  // ...
  for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < width; j++) {
      const pixelOffset = i * width + j;
      const valueOffset = pixelOffset * sourceBands.length;
      const alphaOffset = pixelOffset * 4 + 3;
      
      let isNoData = false;
      for (let b = 0; b < sourceBands.length; b++) {
        const value = data[valueOffset + b];
        if (value === nodataValue || (Number.isNaN(nodataValue) && Number.isNaN(value))) {
          isNoData = true;
          break;
        }
      }
      
      if (isNoData) {
        result[alphaOffset] = 0;
      } else {
        result[alphaOffset] = 255;
      }
    }
  }
  // ...
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

However, without seeing the actual code that handles this, this is just a guess. The key change is to use `Number.isNaN()` to properly check for NaN values, since `NaN === NaN` always returns false in JavaScript.

If you could provide the relevant code that handles the alpha band generation based on no-data values, I could provide a more accurate fix.
