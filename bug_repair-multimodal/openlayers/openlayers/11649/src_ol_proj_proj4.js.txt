I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that when registering proj4js definitions with OpenLayers, geographic coordinate systems (like EPSG:4258) are not properly configured. Specifically:

1. For geographic projections, the `units` property is undefined when it should default to "degrees"
2. The `axisOrientation` is incorrectly set, defaulting to 'enu' when it should be 'neu' for geographic projections

Looking at the code in `src/ol/proj/proj4.js`, the problem is in the `register` function where it creates a new Projection object. It's directly using the properties from proj4's definition without checking if they're appropriate for geographic projections.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/proj4.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      addProjection(
        new Projection({
          code: code,
          axisOrientation: def.axis,
          metersPerUnit: def.to_meter,
          units: def.units,
        })
      );
=======
      const projectionOptions = {
        code: code,
        axisOrientation: def.axis,
        metersPerUnit: def.to_meter,
        units: def.units,
      };
      
      // Handle geographic projections (longlat)
      if (def.proj === 'longlat') {
        if (!projectionOptions.units) {
          projectionOptions.units = 'degrees';
        }
        if (!projectionOptions.axisOrientation) {
          projectionOptions.axisOrientation = 'neu';
        }
      }
      
      addProjection(new Projection(projectionOptions));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix checks if the projection is a geographic one (longlat) and sets appropriate defaults for units and axisOrientation when they're not specified in the proj4js definition. Geographic projections should use "degrees" as units and "neu" (north-east-up) as the axis orientation.
