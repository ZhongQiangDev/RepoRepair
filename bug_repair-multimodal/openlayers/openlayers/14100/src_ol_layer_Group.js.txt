I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue describes a change in behavior between OpenLayers 6.1 and 7.0 where tile requests for layers within a LayerGroup are now being sent sequentially rather than concurrently. This is causing a noticeable slowdown in imagery loading times.

Looking at the code, I notice that in the `LayerGroup` class, when layers are added to the group, each layer is registered with event listeners. The issue is likely related to how these layers are being processed or how their rendering is being triggered.

The key problem appears to be in how the `getLayerStatesArray` method is implemented. This method is responsible for collecting the states of all layers in the group, and it's likely that changes in how these states are processed is affecting the tile loading behavior.

## Fix

The issue is that the `getLayerStatesArray` method is now processing layers sequentially, which is causing tile requests to be sent one at a time. We need to modify this method to allow for concurrent processing of layers.

    array = array !== undefined ? array : [];

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key change is replacing the `forEach` method with direct array access using a for loop, and using `getArray()` to get all layers at once before processing them. This change should allow the browser to handle tile requests concurrently rather than sequentially, restoring the behavior seen in OpenLayers 6.1.

The issue was that the `forEach` method in the newer version might be causing the layers to be processed one at a time in a more sequential manner, whereas direct array access allows for more concurrent processing.
