I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that the vector layer canvas has a wrong size when the map is rotated. This started happening in version 9.1.0, likely introduced by PR #15652. When the map is rotated, the vector layer appears cropped.

Looking at the transform.js file, I need to identify what could be causing this issue. The problem is likely related to how transformations are applied to the canvas when rotation is involved.

Based on the issue description and the code provided, the problem appears to be in the `compose` function in `src/ol/transform.js`. This function creates a composite transform with translation, scale, rotation, and final translation. The issue is likely that the calculation for the final translation components (transform[4] and transform[5]) is incorrect when rotation is applied.

## Fix

The issue is in the `compose` function. The current implementation doesn't correctly handle the transformation when rotation is applied. Let's fix it:

```javascript
### src/ol/transform.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function compose(transform, dx1, dy1, sx, sy, angle, dx2, dy2) {
  const sin = Math.sin(angle);
  const cos = Math.cos(angle);
  transform[0] = sx * cos;
  transform[1] = sy * sin;
  transform[2] = -sx * sin;
  transform[3] = sy * cos;
  transform[4] = dx2 * sx * cos - dy2 * sx * sin + dx1;
  transform[5] = dx2 * sy * sin + dy2 * sy * cos + dy1;
  return transform;
}
=======
export function compose(transform, dx1, dy1, sx, sy, angle, dx2, dy2) {
  const sin = Math.sin(angle);
  const cos = Math.cos(angle);
  transform[0] = sx * cos;
  transform[1] = sy * sin;
  transform[2] = -sx * sin;
  transform[3] = sy * cos;
  transform[4] = dx2 * cos - dy2 * sin + dx1;
  transform[5] = dx2 * sin + dy2 * cos + dy1;
  return transform;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The issue is that the scale factors `sx` and `sy` were being applied to the final translation components, which is incorrect. The final translation should be applied after rotation but without being affected by the scale. The corrected version removes the scale factors from the final translation calculation, which should fix the cropping issue when the map is rotated.
