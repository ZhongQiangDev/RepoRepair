I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that the vector layer canvas is being cropped when the map is rotated. This started happening in version 9.1.0, likely introduced by PR #15652. 

Looking at the provided code from `src/ol/layer/VectorImage.js`, I notice that the issue is likely related to the `imageRatio` property. This property determines the ratio by which the rendered extent should be larger than the viewport extent.

When the map is rotated, the vector layer canvas needs to be larger to accommodate the rotated content without cropping. The current default value of `1` is likely not sufficient when rotation is applied.

## Fix

The solution is to increase the default `imageRatio` value to ensure the canvas is large enough when the map is rotated. This will provide more buffer space for the rotated content.

```javascript
### src/ol/layer/VectorImage.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * @type {number}
     * @private
     */
    this.imageRatio_ =
      options.imageRatio !== undefined ? options.imageRatio : 1;
=======
    /**
     * @type {number}
     * @private
     */
    this.imageRatio_ =
      options.imageRatio !== undefined ? options.imageRatio : 1.5;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change increases the default `imageRatio` from 1 to 1.5, which should provide enough additional canvas space to prevent cropping when the map is rotated. The larger ratio ensures that the rendered extent is 50% larger than the viewport extent, giving more room for rotated content.

The documentation already mentions that "A larger ratio avoids cut images during panning, but will cause a decrease in performance." This is a reasonable trade-off to fix the cropping issue during rotation.
