I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue occurs when a WebGLTileLayer with a palette style is removed and added back to the map. The error messages indicate a WebGL context problem: `WebGL warning: bindTexture: 'tex' is from a different (or lost) WebGL context` or `WebGL: INVALID_OPERATION: bindTexture: object does not belong to this context`.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `TileTexture` class. When a layer is removed from the map, its WebGL textures are created but not properly cleaned up. Then when the layer is added back, it tries to use textures from the previous context, which is no longer valid.

The issue is in the `disposeInternal` method. While it does delete the textures, it doesn't clear the `textures` array. When the layer is added back to the map, the `uploadTile` method checks the length of the `textures` array but doesn't verify if those textures are still valid in the current WebGL context.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  disposeInternal() {
    const gl = this.helper_.getGL();
    this.helper_.deleteBuffer(this.coords);
    for (let i = 0; i < this.textures.length; ++i) {
      gl.deleteTexture(this.textures[i]);
    }
    this.tile.removeEventListener(EventType.CHANGE, this.handleTileChange_);
  }
=======
  disposeInternal() {
    const gl = this.helper_.getGL();
    this.helper_.deleteBuffer(this.coords);
    for (let i = 0; i < this.textures.length; ++i) {
      gl.deleteTexture(this.textures[i]);
    }
    // Clear the textures array to ensure we don't reuse invalid textures
    this.textures.length = 0;
    this.tile.removeEventListener(EventType.CHANGE, this.handleTileChange_);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when a WebGLTileLayer is removed from the map, its textures are not only deleted from the WebGL context but also cleared from the `textures` array. This way, when the layer is added back to the map, it will create new textures in the current WebGL context rather than trying to reuse invalid ones.

The issue specifically affects layers with palette styles because those likely involve more complex texture handling, making the problem more apparent, but the fix will benefit all WebGLTileLayers.
