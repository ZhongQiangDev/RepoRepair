I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about performance degradation when upgrading from OpenLayers 4.4.2 to 4.6.2, specifically with the drawing interaction when using `renderMode: 'image'`. The user mentions that the `ol.source.ImageVector` was deprecated in 4.6.0, and the new approach using `renderMode: 'image'` is much slower.

Looking at the code, the problem is likely in the `composeFrame` method of the `ol.renderer.canvas.VectorLayer` class. When rendering vector layers in image mode, the performance is significantly worse compared to the previous implementation.

The issue appears to be related to how the canvas is being redrawn and managed during vector rendering operations. In particular, the canvas size management and drawing operations in the `composeFrame` method need optimization.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    var drawOffsetX = 0;
    var drawOffsetY = 0;
    var replayContext;
    var transparentLayer = layerState.opacity !== 1;
    var hasRenderListeners = layer.hasListener(ol.render.EventType.RENDER);
    if (transparentLayer || hasRenderListeners) {
      var drawWidth = context.canvas.width;
      var drawHeight = context.canvas.height;
      if (rotation) {
        var drawSize = Math.round(Math.sqrt(drawWidth * drawWidth + drawHeight * drawHeight));
        drawOffsetX = (drawSize - drawWidth) / 2;
        drawOffsetY = (drawSize - drawHeight) / 2;
        drawWidth = drawHeight = drawSize;
      }
      // resize and clear
      this.context.canvas.width = drawWidth;
      this.context.canvas.height = drawHeight;
      replayContext = this.context;

        drawOffsetY = (drawSize - drawHeight) / 2;
        drawWidth = drawHeight = drawSize;
      }
      // Only resize the canvas if it's too small, to avoid unnecessary clearing and performance issues
      if (this.context.canvas.width < drawWidth || this.context.canvas.height < drawHeight) {
        this.context.canvas.width = drawWidth;
        this.context.canvas.height = drawHeight;
      } else {
        this.context.clearRect(0, 0, drawWidth, drawHeight);
      }
      replayContext = this.context;

```

This fix optimizes the canvas management in the `composeFrame` method. Instead of always resizing the canvas (which is an expensive operation that causes the canvas to be cleared and reallocated), we now only resize it when necessary - when the current canvas is too small for the required dimensions. 

For cases where the canvas is already large enough, we simply clear the required area using `clearRect()`, which is much more efficient than resizing the canvas. This should significantly improve the performance of vector layer rendering in image mode, addressing the performance regression reported in the issue.
