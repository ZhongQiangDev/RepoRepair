I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when rendering with `ol/render.toContext()` and setting a `pixelRatio` greater than 1, the line dash pattern is not scaled properly. This causes dashed lines to appear differently (often blurring into continuous lines) compared to when they're rendered on a map.

The problem is that while the pixel coordinates are correctly scaled by the `pixelRatio`, the line dash pattern is not. The issue suggests that scaling the values in the `lineDash` array by the `pixelRatio` would solve the problem.

## Solution

We need to modify the `Stroke` class to include a method that can return a scaled version of the line dash pattern based on the pixel ratio. This will allow the rendering code to use the scaled dash pattern when needed.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Stroke.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Get the line dash style for the stroke.
   * @return {Array<number>} Line dash.
   * @api
   */
  getLineDash() {
    return this.lineDash_;
  }
=======
  /**
   * Get the line dash style for the stroke.
   * @param {number} [pixelRatio=1] Pixel ratio.
   * @return {Array<number>} Line dash.
   * @api
   */
  getLineDash(pixelRatio) {
    if (!this.lineDash_ || pixelRatio === undefined || pixelRatio === 1) {
      return this.lineDash_;
    }
    const lineDash = this.lineDash_.slice();
    for (let i = 0; i < lineDash.length; i++) {
      lineDash[i] = lineDash[i] * pixelRatio;
    }
    return lineDash;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the `getLineDash()` method to accept an optional `pixelRatio` parameter. When a pixel ratio is provided and is not 1, it creates a copy of the line dash array and scales each value by the pixel ratio. This ensures that the dash pattern appears consistent regardless of the device's pixel ratio.

The rendering code that uses `toContext()` with a `pixelRatio` will now be able to get properly scaled line dash values, which will make the dashed lines appear consistent with how they're rendered on a map.
