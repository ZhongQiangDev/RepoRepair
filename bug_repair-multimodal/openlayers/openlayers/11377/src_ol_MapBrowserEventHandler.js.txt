I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue reports that pointermove performance is much slower in version 6.4.0 compared to 6.3.1, affecting operations like zoom, panning, and cursor changes.

Looking at the code, I notice a potential performance issue in the `relayEvent_` method. This method is called for every pointer move event, and it creates a new `MapBrowserEvent` for each move. The problem appears to be that in version 6.4.0, the code is calculating whether dragging is occurring on every single pointer move event, even when not necessary.

The issue is in the `relayEvent_` method where it's doing unnecessary calculations for the dragging state on every pointer move, even when no button is pressed. This would cause performance degradation, especially with many features.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Wrap and relay a pointer event.  Note that this requires that the type
   * string for the MapBrowserEvent matches the PointerEvent type.
   * @param {PointerEvent} pointerEvent Pointer
   * event.
   * @private
   */
  relayEvent_(pointerEvent) {
    this.originalPointerMoveEvent_ = pointerEvent;
    const dragging = !!(this.down_ && this.isMoving_(pointerEvent));
    this.dispatchEvent(
      new MapBrowserEvent(pointerEvent.type, this.map_, pointerEvent, dragging)
    );
  }

   * string for the MapBrowserEvent matches the PointerEvent type.
   * @param {PointerEvent} pointerEvent Pointer
   * event.
   * @private
   */
  relayEvent_(pointerEvent) {
    this.originalPointerMoveEvent_ = pointerEvent;
    // Only calculate dragging state when we have a down event
    // This avoids unnecessary calculations on every pointer move
    const dragging = this.down_ ? !!(this.isMoving_(pointerEvent)) : false;
    this.dispatchEvent(
      new MapBrowserEvent(pointerEvent.type, this.map_, pointerEvent, dragging)
    );
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix optimizes the `relayEvent_` method by only calculating the dragging state when there's an active pointer down event. This avoids the expensive `isMoving_` calculation on every pointer move when no button is pressed, which should significantly improve performance.

The key change is replacing:
```javascript
const dragging = !!(this.down_ && this.isMoving_(pointerEvent));
```

with:
```javascript
const dragging = this.down_ ? !!(this.isMoving_(pointerEvent)) : false;
```

This ensures we only call `isMoving_` when `this.down_` is truthy, avoiding unnecessary calculations when no pointer button is pressed.
