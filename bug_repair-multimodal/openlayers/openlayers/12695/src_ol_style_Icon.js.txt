I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about KML symbols not being properly aligned and sized when displayed in OpenLayers. Specifically:

1. Point symbols appear to be anchored at the center-bottom, when they should be centered
2. The symbols appear much larger than they should be compared to Google Earth

Looking at the screenshots, we can see that the star symbols are positioned below where they should be (they should be centered in the red circles).

The problem is likely in the `Icon.js` file, specifically in how the anchor point is calculated for KML symbols. KML typically uses a center anchor point for symbols, but the current implementation might not be handling this correctly.

## Fix

The issue is in the `getAnchor()` method of the `Icon` class. The problem is that when the displacement is applied to the anchor, it's adding to the y-coordinate when it should be subtracting. This is causing the symbols to appear lower than they should be.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Icon.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const displacement = this.getDisplacement();
    anchor[0] -= displacement[0];
    anchor[1] += displacement[1];
=======
    const displacement = this.getDisplacement();
    anchor[0] -= displacement[0];
    anchor[1] -= displacement[1];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change corrects the y-coordinate calculation for the anchor point. The original code was adding the y-displacement to the anchor's y-coordinate, which was pushing the icon downward. By changing it to subtract the displacement, the icon will be properly centered.

The issue with the size of the symbols is likely related to how KML files specify icon sizes versus how OpenLayers interprets them, but that would require additional changes to the KML parsing logic which isn't shown in the provided code.
