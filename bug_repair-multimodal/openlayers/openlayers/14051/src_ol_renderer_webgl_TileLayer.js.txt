I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is in the `enqueueTiles` method of the `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class. According to the issue description, `layer.getMinZoom()` is being used incorrectly as a tile grid zoom level, when it actually returns a view zoom level that doesn't directly relate to tile grid zoom levels.

The problematic code is on lines 336-340:

```javascript
const minZ = Math.max(
  initialZ - tileLayer.getPreload(),
  tileGrid.getMinZoom(),
  tileLayer.getMinZoom()  // This is the incorrect usage
);
```

This is causing potential issues where tiles might not be loaded correctly, especially when a source with a small tile grid is part of a larger view.

## Fix

I'll replace the incorrect usage of `tileLayer.getMinZoom()` with the proper approach. According to the issue, we should either remove it or replace it with a calculation using `tileGrid.getZForResolution()` from `layer.getMaxResolution()` or `view.getResolutionForZoom(layer.getMinZoom())`.

Since we want to maintain the intended purpose (limiting the minimum zoom level for tile loading), I'll replace it with the correct approach:

```javascript
### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const minZ = Math.max(
      initialZ - tileLayer.getPreload(),
      tileGrid.getMinZoom(),
      tileLayer.getMinZoom()
    );
=======
    const minZ = Math.max(
      initialZ - tileLayer.getPreload(),
      tileGrid.getMinZoom()
    );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix removes the incorrect usage of `tileLayer.getMinZoom()` from the calculation of `minZ`. The `tileGrid.getMinZoom()` is sufficient to determine the minimum zoom level for the tile grid, which is what we need in this context.
