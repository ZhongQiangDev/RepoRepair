I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about the `wrapX` option in GeoTIFF source tiles. According to the issue:

1. The `wrapX` option is misleadingly named because it's actually used to crop the output to the tile grid extent on both X and Y axes when not reprojecting.

2. This behavior is unrelated to what reprojection expects `wrapX` to mean (which is whether the output will be repeated on adjacent worlds on the X axis when reprojected to a global projection).

3. The issue occurs when reprojection is involved - the cropping behavior is not respected.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `TileImage` class, which is a base class for sources providing images divided into a tile grid. The issue specifically mentions that the `wrapX` option is misleadingly named and should be renamed to something more appropriate.

## Fix

The solution is to rename the `wrapX` option to something more descriptive of its actual behavior. Since it's used to crop the output to the tile grid extent, a better name would be `cropToExtent` or similar. However, since this is a breaking change, we need to maintain backward compatibility.

Here's my proposed fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/source/TileImage.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
 * @property {boolean} [wrapX] Whether to wrap the world horizontally. The default, is to
 * request out-of-bounds tiles from the server. When set to `false`, only one
 * world will be rendered. When set to `true`, tiles will be requested for one
 * world only, but they will be wrapped horizontally to render multiple worlds.

 * @property {boolean} [wrapX] Whether to wrap the world horizontally. The default, is to
 * request out-of-bounds tiles from the server. When set to `false`, only one
 * world will be rendered. When set to `true`, tiles will be requested for one
 * world only, but they will be wrapped horizontally to render multiple worlds.
 * @property {boolean} [cropToExtent] Whether to crop the source tiles to the tile grid extent.
 * This is `false` by default. If not specified, the value of `wrapX` is used for backward
 * compatibility, but this behavior is deprecated.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### src/ol/source/TileImage.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      wrapX: options.wrapX,
=======
      wrapX: options.wrapX,
      cropToExtent: options.cropToExtent !== undefined ? options.cropToExtent : options.wrapX,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:

1. Adds a new `cropToExtent` option to the API documentation
2. Makes the constructor accept this new option
3. For backward compatibility, if `cropToExtent` is not specified, it falls back to using the value of `wrapX`

This way, users can now separately control:
- Whether to wrap the world horizontally (`wrapX`)
- Whether to crop source tiles to the tile grid extent (`cropToExtent`)

The implementation allows both behaviors to be used independently, which addresses the issue mentioned in the bug report.
