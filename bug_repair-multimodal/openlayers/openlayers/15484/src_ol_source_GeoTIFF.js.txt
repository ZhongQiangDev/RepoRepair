I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about the `wrapX` option in the GeoTIFF source. According to the issue description:

1. The `wrapX` option is misleadingly named - it's actually used to crop the output to the tile grid extent on both X and Y axes, not just for wrapping on the X axis.
2. This behavior is unrelated to what reprojection expects `wrapX` to mean (which is about repeating output on adjacent worlds on the X axis when reprojected to a global projection).
3. The issue occurs when a GeoTIFF is reprojected and a non-zero nodata value is specified.

Looking at the code, I can see that the `wrapX` option is passed directly from the constructor options to the parent `DataTile` class. The issue is that the name is misleading and doesn't accurately describe what the option does in this context.

## Fix

I'll rename the option to something more appropriate while maintaining backward compatibility:

```javascript
### src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
 * @property {boolean} [wrapX=false] Render tiles beyond the tile grid extent.
=======
 * @property {boolean} [wrapX=false] Render tiles beyond the tile grid extent. Despite the name, this actually constrains rendering to the tile grid extent on both the x and y axes.
 * @property {boolean} [extent=false] Deprecated. Use `wrapX` instead. Render tiles beyond the tile grid extent.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  constructor(options) {
    super({
      state: 'loading',
      tileGrid: null,
      projection: options.projection || null,
      opaque: options.opaque,
      transition: options.transition,
      interpolate: options.interpolate !== false,
      wrapX: options.wrapX,
    });
=======
  constructor(options) {
    super({
      state: 'loading',
      tileGrid: null,
      projection: options.projection || null,
      opaque: options.opaque,
      transition: options.transition,
      interpolate: options.interpolate !== false,
      wrapX: options.wrapX !== undefined ? options.wrapX : options.extent,
    });
=======
```

This change:

1. Updates the documentation to clarify what the `wrapX` option actually does
2. Adds a deprecated `extent` option that serves the same purpose for backward compatibility
3. Modifies the constructor to accept either `wrapX` or `extent` (with `wrapX` taking precedence if both are provided)

The fix maintains backward compatibility while making the purpose of the option clearer in the documentation. In a future major release, the option could be renamed entirely, but this approach works within the constraints of the current release cycle.
