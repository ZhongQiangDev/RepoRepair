I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, the problem is related to image+label combinations when `declutterMode` is different than 'declutter'. The issue is reported in the ol-mapbox-style repository but affects OpenLayers core.

Looking at the code, I can see that the `Icon` class extends `ImageStyle` and passes the `declutterMode` option to the parent class. The issue is likely that when using both an icon and a text label, the decluttering behavior needs to be consistent between them.

The fix would involve adding an `ignorePlacement` option to the `ol.style.Image` and `ol.style.Text` classes as mentioned in the issue. However, since we only have the `Icon.js` file available, I'll focus on adding this option to the `Icon` class which extends `ImageStyle`.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Icon.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
 * @property {"declutter"|"obstacle"|"none"|undefined} [declutterMode] Declutter mode.
 */

/**
=======
 * @property {"declutter"|"obstacle"|"none"|undefined} [declutterMode] Declutter mode.
 * @property {boolean} [ignorePlacement=false] If `true`, the icon will be visible even if it collides with
 * other previously drawn symbols. Only has an effect if the `declutterMode` option is set to `"declutter"`.
 */

/**
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Icon.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    super({
      opacity: opacity,
      rotation: rotation,
      scale: scale,
      displacement:
        options.displacement !== undefined ? options.displacement : [0, 0],
      rotateWithView: rotateWithView,
      declutterMode: options.declutterMode,
    });
=======
    super({
      opacity: opacity,
      rotation: rotation,
      scale: scale,
      displacement:
        options.displacement !== undefined ? options.displacement : [0, 0],
      rotateWithView: rotateWithView,
      declutterMode: options.declutterMode,
      ignorePlacement: options.ignorePlacement,
    });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Icon.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      size: this.size_ !== null ? this.size_.slice() : undefined,
      src: this.getSrc(),
      displacement: this.getDisplacement().slice(),
      declutterMode: this.getDeclutterMode(),
=======
      size: this.size_ !== null ? this.size_.slice() : undefined,
      src: this.getSrc(),
      displacement: this.getDisplacement().slice(),
      declutterMode: this.getDeclutterMode(),
      ignorePlacement: this.getIgnorePlacement(),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes add the `ignorePlacement` option to the `Icon` class, which will allow users to specify that an icon should be visible even if it collides with other symbols when using decluttering. This addresses the issue where users want to declutter only text but not icons (or vice versa) when using image+label combinations.

Note that this is only part of the solution. The complete fix would also require changes to the `ImageStyle` base class and the `Text` class to properly handle the `ignorePlacement` option, but those files aren't provided in the context.
