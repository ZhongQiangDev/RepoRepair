I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about fixing image+label combinations when `declutterMode` is different than 'declutter'. The problem appears to be in the `forEachFeatureAtCoordinate` method of the `ExecutorGroup` class, where there's a check that prevents hit detection for decluttered features that are not included in the `declutteredFeatures` array.

Currently, the code has this condition:
```javascript
if (
  !declutteredFeatures ||
  (builderType !== 'Image' && builderType !== 'Text') ||
  declutteredFeatures.includes(feature)
) {
  // Process the feature
}
```

This means that if a feature is an Image or Text and it's not in the declutteredFeatures array, it won't be processed. However, according to the issue, we need to fix image+label combinations when declutterMode is different than 'declutter', which suggests that we need to modify this condition to handle different declutter modes.

## Fix

The fix should modify the condition to properly handle image+label combinations with different declutter modes. Let's update the code:

```javascript
### src/ol/render/canvas/ExecutorGroup.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
          if (
            !declutteredFeatures ||
            (builderType !== 'Image' && builderType !== 'Text') ||
            declutteredFeatures.includes(feature)
          ) {
=======
          if (
            !declutteredFeatures ||
            (builderType !== 'Image' && builderType !== 'Text') ||
            declutteredFeatures.includes(feature) ||
            (builderType === 'Image' && feature.get('declutterMode') !== 'declutter')
          ) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds an additional condition to allow hit detection for Image features when their declutterMode is not set to 'declutter'. This way, image+label combinations will work correctly when declutterMode is different than 'declutter'.
