I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is in the OpenLayers library, specifically with the `applyTransform` function when used with an empty extent and a transform from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857.

When an empty extent is created with `createEmpty()`, it's initialized with `[Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]`. When this empty extent is transformed using `applyTransform` with the EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 transform, it results in NaN values because the transform function (`fromEPSG4326`) uses `Math.tan()` which returns NaN when given Infinity.

The issue is in the `fromEPSG4326` function in the `proj/epsg3857.js` file, which is imported and used in the `getTransform` function in `proj.js`.

## Fix

We need to modify the `fromEPSG4326` function to handle Infinity values properly. Since we don't have direct access to that file in the provided code, we'll need to modify the `getTransform` function in `proj.js` to handle empty extents specially.

```javascript
### src/ol/proj.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function getTransform(source, destination) {
  const sourceProjection = get(source);
  const destinationProjection = get(destination);
  return getTransformFromProjections(sourceProjection, destinationProjection);
}
=======
export function getTransform(source, destination) {
  const sourceProjection = get(source);
  const destinationProjection = get(destination);
  const transformFn = getTransformFromProjections(sourceProjection, destinationProjection);
  
  // Special handling for EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 transform with empty extents
  if (sourceProjection.getCode() === 'EPSG:4326' && 
      destinationProjection.getCode() === 'EPSG:3857') {
    return function(input, output, dimension) {
      // Check if this is an empty extent [Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]
      if (input.length === 4 && 
          input[0] === Infinity && 
          input[1] === Infinity && 
          input[2] === -Infinity && 
          input[3] === -Infinity) {
        // Return a valid empty extent in the target projection
        const result = output || [Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity];
        result[0] = Infinity;
        result[1] = Infinity;
        result[2] = -Infinity;
        result[3] = -Infinity;
        return result;
      }
      // Otherwise use the normal transform
      return transformFn(input, output, dimension);
    };
  }
  
  return transformFn;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds special handling for the EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857 transform when dealing with empty extents. When an empty extent is detected (identified by its characteristic values), it returns a new empty extent in the target projection instead of trying to transform the Infinity values, which would result in NaN.
