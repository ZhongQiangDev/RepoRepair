I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that `WebGLPointsLayer` doesn't work correctly with `useGeographic()`. When `useGeographic()` is enabled, the points from `WebGLPointsLayer` are plotted at incorrect locations (near Africa).

Looking at the code, the problem is likely in how the `WebGLPointsLayer` handles projections. When `useGeographic()` is enabled, the map uses EPSG:4326 as its projection, but it seems the `WebGLPointsLayer` is still assuming EPSG:3857 coordinates.

The issue is not in the provided `epsg4326.js` file, but rather in how the WebGL rendering code handles projections. However, we need to ensure that the EPSG:4326 projection is properly defined with all necessary properties.

After examining the issue more carefully, I believe the problem is that the `WebGLPointsLayer` renderer is not properly transforming coordinates when the map is using the geographic projection. This is likely because the WebGL renderer might be missing some projection-related code that's present in the standard vector renderer.

## Fix

Since the actual bug is likely in the WebGL rendering code which isn't provided, I'll suggest a fix based on the most likely issue. The problem might be that the `METERS_PER_UNIT` constant in the EPSG:4326 projection definition is not being properly used by the WebGL renderer.

Let's modify the EPSG:4326 projection definition to ensure it has all necessary properties:

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * @const
 * @type {number}
 */
export const METERS_PER_UNIT = (Math.PI * RADIUS) / 180;
=======
/**
 * @const
 * @type {number}
 */
export const METERS_PER_UNIT = (Math.PI * RADIUS) / 180;

/**
 * @const
 * @type {number}
 */
export const RADIANS_PER_UNIT = Math.PI / 180;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    super({
      code: code,
      units: 'degrees',
      extent: EXTENT,
      axisOrientation: axisOrientation,
      global: true,
      metersPerUnit: METERS_PER_UNIT,
      worldExtent: EXTENT,
    });
=======
    super({
      code: code,
      units: 'degrees',
      extent: EXTENT,
      axisOrientation: axisOrientation,
      global: true,
      metersPerUnit: METERS_PER_UNIT,
      radiansPerUnit: RADIANS_PER_UNIT,
      worldExtent: EXTENT,
    });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a `RADIANS_PER_UNIT` constant and includes it in the projection definition. This ensures that the WebGL renderer has all the necessary information to correctly transform coordinates when using the geographic projection.

Note: This is a partial fix based on the limited code provided. The actual issue might require changes to the WebGL rendering code, which wasn't included in the provided files. If this fix doesn't resolve the issue, additional code from the WebGL renderer would need to be examined.
