I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that `WebGLPointsLayer` doesn't work correctly with `useGeographic()`. When `useGeographic()` is enabled, the points are plotted at incorrect locations (near Africa).

Looking at the code, I notice that the `EPSG3857Projection` class is referenced in the `PROJECTIONS` array, but it's not defined in the file. This is likely causing issues with the projection system, particularly when using `WebGLPointsLayer` with geographic coordinates.

The bug is in the `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js` file where the `EPSG3857Projection` class is referenced but not defined before use.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * @classdesc
 * Projection object for web/spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).
 */


/**
 * Projections equal to EPSG:3857.
=======
/**
 * @classdesc
 * Projection object for web/spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).
 */
class EPSG3857Projection extends Projection {
  /**
   * @param {string} code Code.
   */
  constructor(code) {
    super({
      code: code,
      units: 'm',
      extent: EXTENT,
      global: true,
      worldExtent: WORLD_EXTENT,
      getPointResolution: function (resolution, point) {
        return resolution / Math.cosh(point[1] / RADIUS);
      },
    });
  }
}

/**
 * Projections equal to EPSG:3857.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the missing `EPSG3857Projection` class definition that was referenced but not defined in the file. The class extends `Projection` and includes the necessary configuration for the EPSG:3857 projection, including units, extent, and a method to calculate point resolution.

The issue was that without this class definition, the projection system couldn't properly handle the conversion between geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326) and web mercator (EPSG:3857) when using `WebGLPointsLayer`, causing the points to be displayed at incorrect locations.
