I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue states that the `setOpacity` function for feature styles is not working in OpenLayers 6.2.0, specifically for image styles. The feature should blink (change opacity) but it doesn't.

Looking at the provided code for `Icon.js`, I notice that while the `opacity` property is passed to the parent `ImageStyle` constructor, there's no implementation to update the opacity after the style is created. The `Icon` class extends `ImageStyle`, but it doesn't override or implement the `setOpacity` method to update the underlying image opacity.

The issue is that when `setOpacity` is called on an Icon instance, it updates the opacity property in the parent class, but this change is not propagated to the actual rendered image.

## Fix

We need to add a `setOpacity` method to the `Icon` class that will update the opacity and trigger a redraw. Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/style/Icon.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  unlistenImageChange(listener) {
    this.iconImage_.removeEventListener(EventType.CHANGE, listener);
  }
}

=======
  unlistenImageChange(listener) {
    this.iconImage_.removeEventListener(EventType.CHANGE, listener);
  }

  /**
   * Set the opacity.
   *
   * @param {number} opacity Opacity.
   * @api
   */
  setOpacity(opacity) {
    super.setOpacity(opacity);
    this.iconImage_.setOpacity(opacity);
  }
}

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a `setOpacity` method to the `Icon` class that:
1. Calls the parent class's `setOpacity` method to update the opacity property
2. Updates the opacity on the underlying `iconImage_` object, which will affect the rendered image

This ensures that when opacity is changed on an Icon style, the visual appearance of the icon will update accordingly, allowing the blinking effect to work as expected.
