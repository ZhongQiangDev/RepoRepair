I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is related to the `ratio` parameter in the `ImageArcGISRest` source class. According to the issue description:

1. The default value of `ratio` is 1.5, which causes problems when the computer's zoom/scaling is not 100%.
2. When using a ratio value other than 1, there can be misalignment between the layer and the map, especially after map rotation.
3. The workaround is to set the ratio to 1.

Looking at the code, I can see that the `ratio_` property is indeed initialized with a default value of 1.5 in the constructor:

```javascript
this.ratio_ = options.ratio !== undefined ? options.ratio : 1.5;
```

## Fix

The solution is to change the default value of the `ratio` parameter from 1.5 to 1, which will prevent the layer-map mismatch issues described in the bug report.

Here's the search/replace edit:

```javascript
### src/ol/source/ImageArcGISRest.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
   * @property {import("../proj.js").ProjectionLike} [projection] Projection. Default is the view projection.
   * The projection code must contain a numeric end portion separated by :
   * or the entire code must form a valid ArcGIS SpatialReference definition.
   * @property {number} [ratio=1.5] Ratio. `1` means image requests are the size of the map viewport,
   * `2` means twice the size of the map viewport, and so on.
   * @property {Array<number>} [resolutions] Resolutions. If specified, requests will be made for
   * these resolutions only.

    this.ratio_ = options.ratio !== undefined ? options.ratio : 1.5;

    /**
     * @private
     * @type {number}
     */
    this.ratio_ = options.ratio !== undefined ? options.ratio : 1;

```

These changes will set the default ratio to 1 instead of 1.5, which should resolve the layer-map mismatch issues described in the bug report, particularly when the computer's zoom/scaling is not at 100% or when the map is rotated.
