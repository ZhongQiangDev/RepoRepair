I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is related to OpenLayers not working properly with proj4js version 2.6.1 and above. The problem appears to be related to axis order interpretation. In proj4js 2.6.1, they "Fixed interpretation of axis order" according to the release notes.

Looking at the screenshots:
1. With proj4js 2.6.0, everything works correctly
2. With proj4js 2.6.1, layers are rotated when using different projections

The issue is likely in how OpenLayers handles the axis orientation information from projections. When proj4js updated its axis order handling in 2.6.1, it exposed a problem in OpenLayers' code.

Looking at the `Projection` class, I can see that it stores the axis orientation but doesn't seem to properly handle the changes introduced in proj4js 2.6.1.

## Fix

The fix needs to ensure that OpenLayers correctly interprets the axis orientation from proj4js 2.6.1+. The issue is that OpenLayers needs to adapt to the new axis order interpretation in proj4js.

```javascript
### src/ol/proj/Projection.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Get the axis orientation of this projection.
   * Example values are:
   * enu - the default easting, northing, elevation.
   * neu - northing, easting, up - useful for "lat/long" geographic coordinates,
   *     or south orientated transverse mercator.
   * wnu - westing, northing, up - some planetary coordinate systems have
   *     "west positive" coordinate systems
   * @return {string} Axis orientation.
   * @api
   */
  getAxisOrientation() {
    return this.axisOrientation_;
  }

   */
  getAxisOrientation() {
    return this.axisOrientation_;
  }

  /**
   * Is the axis order the same as Proj4's, taking into account Proj4 version?
   * @return {boolean} Whether the axis order is the same as Proj4's.
   */
  isAxisOrderSameAsProj4() {
    return this.axisOrientation_.substr(0, 2) === 'en';
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a new method `isAxisOrderSameAsProj4()` to the Projection class that checks if the axis order is the same as what Proj4 expects. This will allow OpenLayers to correctly handle the axis order changes in proj4js 2.6.1+.

The method checks if the first two characters of the axis orientation are 'en' (easting, northing), which is the default order in OpenLayers. If the projection uses a different order (like 'ne' for northing, easting), OpenLayers can now detect this and handle it appropriately when interacting with proj4js.

Note: This is a partial fix that adds the necessary method to detect axis order differences. The complete fix would also require changes to the code that uses this method to properly handle the axis order when transforming coordinates. However, without seeing those files, I've focused on adding the detection method that would be needed by those transformation functions.
