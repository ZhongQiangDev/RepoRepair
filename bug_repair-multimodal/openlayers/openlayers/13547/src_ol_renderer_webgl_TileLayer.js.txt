I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about extending the "gutter" option to more tile sources beyond just TileWMS. Currently, when rendering with WebGL, the gutter is removed before creating the texture, which doesn't prevent edge effects. The issue specifically mentions that this functionality should be available to more tile sources like XYZ and DataTile.

Looking at the code, I can see that in the `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class, the gutter is passed to the `TileTexture` constructor, but it's only obtained from the tile source using `getGutterForProjection()`. The problem is that not all tile sources implement this method, and the gutter handling needs to be improved to prevent edge effects.

## Solution

I need to modify the code to:

1. Make sure the gutter option is properly handled for all tile sources
2. Ensure the gutter is properly used when creating textures in WebGL rendering

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const tilePixelRatio = tileSource.getTilePixelRatio(frameState.pixelRatio);
    const gutter = tileSource.getGutterForProjection(viewState.projection);
=======
    const tilePixelRatio = tileSource.getTilePixelRatio(frameState.pixelRatio);
    let gutter = 0;
    if (tileSource.getGutterForProjection) {
      gutter = tileSource.getGutterForProjection(viewState.projection);
    } else if ('getGutter' in tileSource) {
      gutter = tileSource.getGutter();
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that we check for both `getGutterForProjection` and a simpler `getGutter` method that could be implemented by other tile sources like XYZ and DataTile. If neither method exists, we default to 0 (no gutter).

Now let's make sure the gutter is properly used when creating textures:

```javascript
### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
              tileTexture = new TileTexture({
                tile: tile,
                grid: tileGrid,
                helper: this.helper,
                tilePixelRatio: tilePixelRatio,
                gutter: gutter,
              });
=======
              tileTexture = new TileTexture({
                tile: tile,
                grid: tileGrid,
                helper: this.helper,
                tilePixelRatio: tilePixelRatio,
                gutter: gutter,
              });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The code for creating the TileTexture already passes the gutter parameter correctly, so no change is needed here. The issue is with how we get the gutter value, which we fixed in the previous edit.

With these changes, the gutter option will be available to more tile sources, and the edge effects should be reduced when rendering with WebGL.
