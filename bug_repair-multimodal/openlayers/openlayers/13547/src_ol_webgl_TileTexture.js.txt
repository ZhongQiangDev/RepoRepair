I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about extending the "gutter" option to more tile sources beyond TileWMS. Currently, the gutter option is supported in the TileTexture class, but there's a problem with how it's handled for WebGL tile layers. The gutter is being removed before creating the texture, which doesn't prevent edge effects.

Looking at the code, I can see that in the `uploadTile_` method, there's special handling for the gutter when dealing with ImageTile or ReprojTile, but not for DataTile. This is causing the edge effects mentioned in the issue.

## Fix

We need to modify the `uploadTile_` method to handle the gutter for DataTile as well. Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const pixelSize = [
      this.size[0] * this.tilePixelRatio_,
      this.size[1] * this.tilePixelRatio_,
    ];
    const data = tile.getData();
=======
    let data = tile.getData();
    const gutter = this.tilePixelRatio_ * this.gutter_;
    const pixelSize = [
      this.size[0] * this.tilePixelRatio_,
      this.size[1] * this.tilePixelRatio_,
    ];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to update the `getPixelData` method to properly handle the gutter for DataTile:

```javascript
### src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (this.tile instanceof DataTile) {
      const data = this.tile.getData();
      const pixelsPerRow = Math.floor(this.tilePixelRatio_ * this.size[0]);
=======
    if (this.tile instanceof DataTile) {
      const data = this.tile.getData();
      const pixelsPerRow = Math.floor(this.tilePixelRatio_ * this.size[0]);
      const gutter = Math.round(this.tilePixelRatio_ * this.gutter_);
      col += gutter;
      row += gutter;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the gutter option is properly handled for DataTile sources, which will help prevent the edge effects shown in the issue.
