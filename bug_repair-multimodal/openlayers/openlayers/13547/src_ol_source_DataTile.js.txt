I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about adding a "gutter" option to more tile sources, specifically to the `DataTileSource` class. The gutter is a buffer around tiles that helps avoid edge effects when interpolating between tiles. Currently, this option is only available for TileWMS sources, but it should be extended to other sources like XYZ and DataTile.

Looking at the provided code for `DataTileSource`, I can see that it doesn't have a gutter option in its constructor parameters or in the options it passes to the parent class. We need to add this functionality.

## Solution

I'll add the gutter option to the `DataTileSource` class by:

1. Adding a `gutter` property to the `Options` typedef
2. Passing the gutter option to the parent class constructor
3. Ensuring the gutter is properly handled in the tile creation process

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/source/DataTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
 * @property {number} [tilePixelRatio] Tile pixel ratio.
 * @property {boolean} [wrapX=false] Render tiles beyond the antimeridian.
 * @property {number} [transition] Transition time when fading in new tiles (in miliseconds).
 * @property {number} [bandCount=4] Number of bands represented in the data.
 * @property {boolean} [interpolate=false] Use interpolated values when resampling.  By default,
 * the nearest neighbor is used when resampling.

### src/ol/source/DataTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      tilePixelRatio: options.tilePixelRatio,
      wrapX: options.wrapX,
      transition: options.transition,
      interpolate: options.interpolate,

      tilePixelRatio: options.tilePixelRatio,
      wrapX: options.wrapX,
      transition: options.transition,
      interpolate: options.interpolate,
      gutter: options.gutter,

```

```javascript
### src/ol/source/DataTile.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const tile = new DataTile(
      assign({tileCoord: [z, x, y], loader: loader}, this.tileOptions)
    );
=======
    const tile = new DataTile(
      assign({
        tileCoord: [z, x, y], 
        loader: loader,
        gutter: this.getGutter()
      }, this.tileOptions)
    );
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes add the gutter option to the DataTileSource class, making it available for use with this tile source type. The gutter parameter is passed to the parent class constructor and also to each DataTile instance created by the source.

Note that this is just part of the solution. The issue also mentions revising how the gutter is handled for WebGL tile layers, but that would require changes to other files that aren't provided in the code segments. The changes I've made address the first part of the issue by making the gutter option available to the DataTileSource class.
