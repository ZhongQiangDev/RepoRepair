I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the error message "Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length" and the context provided, the issue appears to be in the `deflateMultiCoordinatesArray` function in `src/ol/geom/flat/deflate.js`. 

The problem is likely occurring when processing GeoJSON data with complex geometries. The function is trying to access an array element that doesn't exist when it calls `deflateCoordinatesArray` with `endss[i]` as the last parameter. If `endss[i]` is undefined (which happens when `i` is greater than or equal to the initial length of `endss`), the function should create a new array instead of trying to use an undefined value.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/ol/geom/flat/deflate.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  for (let j = 0, jj = coordinatesss.length; j < jj; ++j) {
    const ends = deflateCoordinatesArray(
      flatCoordinates,
      offset,
      coordinatesss[j],
      stride,
      endss[i]
    );
    endss[i++] = ends;
=======
  for (let j = 0, jj = coordinatesss.length; j < jj; ++j) {
    const ends = deflateCoordinatesArray(
      flatCoordinates,
      offset,
      coordinatesss[j],
      stride,
      endss[i] || undefined
    );
    endss[i++] = ends;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that we're not passing an out-of-bounds array element to `deflateCoordinatesArray`. By using `endss[i] || undefined`, we explicitly pass `undefined` when `endss[i]` doesn't exist, which allows the called function to handle it properly by creating a new array as needed.
