I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about iframes and data URIs being incorrectly considered as critical requests in the Critical Request Chains (CRC) computation. According to the issue:

1. iframes should not be considered critical requests because they are not render-blocking, even though they are fetched at Highest priority.
2. Data URIs should also be removed from CRC as they aren't actual network requests.

Looking at the code, we need to modify the `isCritical` method in `critical-request-chains.js` to exclude iframes and data URIs from being considered critical.

## Solution

We need to:
1. Add iframe resource type to the `nonCriticalResourceTypes` array
2. Add a check to exclude data URIs (which start with "data:")

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // XHRs are fetched at High priority, but we exclude them, as they are unlikely to be critical
    // Images are also non-critical.
    // Treat any images missed by category, primarily favicons, as non-critical resources
    const nonCriticalResourceTypes = [
      WebInspector.resourceTypes.Image._category,
      WebInspector.resourceTypes.XHR._category,
    ];
    if (nonCriticalResourceTypes.includes(resourceTypeCategory) ||
        request.mimeType && request.mimeType.startsWith('image/')) {
      return false;
    }
=======
    // XHRs are fetched at High priority, but we exclude them, as they are unlikely to be critical
    // Images are also non-critical.
    // iframes are not render-blocking even though they're high priority
    // Treat any images missed by category, primarily favicons, as non-critical resources
    const nonCriticalResourceTypes = [
      WebInspector.resourceTypes.Image._category,
      WebInspector.resourceTypes.XHR._category,
      WebInspector.resourceTypes.Document._category,
    ];
    if (nonCriticalResourceTypes.includes(resourceTypeCategory) ||
        request.mimeType && request.mimeType.startsWith('image/') ||
        request.url.startsWith('data:')) {
      return false;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds `WebInspector.resourceTypes.Document._category` to the `nonCriticalResourceTypes` array, which includes iframes
2. Adds a check for data URIs by testing if the URL starts with "data:"
3. Updates the comment to explain why iframes are excluded

The fix ensures that both iframes and data URIs are no longer considered critical requests in the Critical Request Chains computation.
