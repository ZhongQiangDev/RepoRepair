I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description and screenshot, there's a problem with the library detector when it tries to access the `version.match` function. The error message "version.match is not a function" suggests that `version` is not a string in some cases, which is causing the error when the library detector tries to use string methods on it.

Looking at the code in `lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js`, I can see that the `version` property from the library detector result is being passed directly to the output. The issue likely occurs when the library detector returns a version that's not a string (possibly an object or another non-string type).

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /** @type {JSLibrary[]} */
  const jsLibraries = await passContext.driver.evaluateAsync(expression);

  return jsLibraries.map(lib => ({
    detector: /** @type {'js'} */ ('js'),
    id: lib.id,
    name: lib.name,
    version: lib.version || undefined,
    npm: lib.npm || undefined,
  }));
=======
  /** @type {JSLibrary[]} */
  const jsLibraries = await passContext.driver.evaluateAsync(expression);

  return jsLibraries.map(lib => ({
    detector: /** @type {'js'} */ ('js'),
    id: lib.id,
    name: lib.name,
    version: typeof lib.version === 'string' ? lib.version : undefined,
    npm: lib.npm || undefined,
  }));
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that the `version` property is only used if it's a string. If it's not a string (like an object or another type), it will be set to `undefined` instead, preventing the "version.match is not a function" error.
