I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that the offline pass doesn't always correctly detect offline status. According to the issue description:

1. When running Lighthouse on bhphotovideo.com, it reports that the start URL doesn't load offline but the current page does.
2. During the offline pass, the desktop version of the page is loaded, and network requests show `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` flags as `false`.
3. This shouldn't be possible when offline - if truly offline, the page should either fail to load or be served from the service worker/cache.

Looking at the code in `start-url.js`, the issue is in the `_attemptStartURLFetch` method. The current implementation only considers a request successful if it's served by a service worker (`response.fromServiceWorker`). However, in offline mode, content can also be served from the browser cache (`response.fromDiskCache`), which is a valid offline response.

## Fix

We need to modify the `_attemptStartURLFetch` method to consider responses from disk cache as valid offline responses as well:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (!response.fromServiceWorker) {
          return resolve({
            statusCode: -1,
            explanation: 'Unable to fetch start URL via service worker.',
          });
        }
        // Successful SW-served fetch of the start_URL
=======
        if (!response.fromServiceWorker && !response.fromDiskCache) {
          return resolve({
            statusCode: -1,
            explanation: 'Unable to fetch start URL via service worker or cache.',
          });
        }
        // Successful SW-served or cache-served fetch of the start_URL
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will make the test pass if the start URL is served either from a service worker or from disk cache, both of which are valid ways to serve content when offline.
