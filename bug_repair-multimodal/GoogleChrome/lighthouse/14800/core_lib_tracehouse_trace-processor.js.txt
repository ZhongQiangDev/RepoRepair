I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when processing trace events, the code fails with the error "Unable to determine tid for renderer process". This happens because in some cases, the `FrameCommittedInBrowser` event has a `processPseudoId` instead of a `processId`, causing the `mainFramePids` array to contain `undefined` values.

Looking at the code in `findMainFramePidTids`, it's extracting the process IDs from `FrameCommittedInBrowser` events using `e?.args?.data?.processId`. However, according to the issue, sometimes the event has `processPseudoId` instead of `processId`. We need to modify the code to check for both fields.

## Fix

```javascript
### core/lib/tracehouse/trace-processor.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const mainFramePids = frameCommittedEvts.length
      ? frameCommittedEvts.map(e => e?.args?.data?.processId)
      // …But old traces and some timespan traces may not. In these situations, we'll assume the
      // primary process ID remains constant (as there were no navigations).
      : [mainFrameInfo.startingPid];
=======
    const mainFramePids = frameCommittedEvts.length
      ? frameCommittedEvts.map(e => e?.args?.data?.processId || e?.args?.data?.processPseudoId)
      // …But old traces and some timespan traces may not. In these situations, we'll assume the
      // primary process ID remains constant (as there were no navigations).
      : [mainFrameInfo.startingPid];
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the code to check for both `processId` and `processPseudoId` in the `FrameCommittedInBrowser` events. If `processId` is not available, it will fall back to using `processPseudoId`. This should prevent the `mainFramePids` array from containing `undefined` values, which was causing the error "Unable to determine tid for renderer process".
