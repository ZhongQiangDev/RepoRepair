I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Looking at the issue, the report page is blank when running the tool. The screenshot shows that the page loads but no content is displayed.

After examining the code, I found the issue. In the `generateReportHtml` method, there's a problem with how the JavaScript is being sanitized. The code is replacing all instances of `</` with `\\u003c/` in the JavaScript, which would break any closing HTML tags in the JavaScript code. This is likely causing script errors that prevent the report from rendering properly.

The sanitization should only be applied to the JSON data, not to the JavaScript code. Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  generateReportHtml(reportAsJson) {
    const sanitizedJson = JSON.stringify(reportAsJson).replace(/</g, '\\u003c');
    const sanitizedJavascript = REPORT_JAVASCRIPT.replace(/<\//g, '\\u003c/');

    return ReportGeneratorV2.replaceStrings(REPORT_TEMPLATE, [
      {search: '%%LIGHTHOUSE_JSON%%', replacement: sanitizedJson},
      {search: '%%LIGHTHOUSE_JAVASCRIPT%%', replacement: sanitizedJavascript},
=======
  generateReportHtml(reportAsJson) {
    const sanitizedJson = JSON.stringify(reportAsJson).replace(/</g, '\\u003c');

    return ReportGeneratorV2.replaceStrings(REPORT_TEMPLATE, [
      {search: '%%LIGHTHOUSE_JSON%%', replacement: sanitizedJson},
      {search: '%%LIGHTHOUSE_JAVASCRIPT%%', replacement: REPORT_JAVASCRIPT},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The issue is that the JavaScript code is being unnecessarily sanitized, which is breaking the functionality. By removing the sanitization of the JavaScript code and using the original `REPORT_JAVASCRIPT` directly, the report should render correctly.
