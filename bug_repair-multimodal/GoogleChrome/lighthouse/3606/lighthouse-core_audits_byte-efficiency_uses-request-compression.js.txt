I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that the audit is incorrectly reporting that compression should be enabled, even though gzip compression is already enabled on the resource. Looking at the screenshot and the curl output, we can see that the server is indeed sending the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header.

The problem is in the `uses-request-compression.js` file. The audit is checking for uncompressed responses, but it's not properly filtering out responses that are already compressed.

The issue is likely in how the `ResponseCompression` artifact is being processed. The audit is assuming that all responses in the `uncompressedResponses` array are actually uncompressed, but it seems that some compressed responses are being included in this array.

## Fix

We need to modify the code to check if a response is already compressed by looking for the `Content-Encoding` header before considering it for the audit:

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  static audit_(artifacts) {
    const uncompressedResponses = artifacts.ResponseCompression;

    const results = [];
    uncompressedResponses.forEach(record => {
=======
  static audit_(artifacts) {
    const uncompressedResponses = artifacts.ResponseCompression;

    const results = [];
    uncompressedResponses.forEach(record => {
      // Skip responses that are already compressed
      if (record.isContentEncoded) {
        return;
      }
      
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix assumes that the `ResponseCompression` artifact includes an `isContentEncoded` property that indicates whether the response has a `Content-Encoding` header. If this property doesn't exist, we would need to modify the artifact gathering code as well, but based on the issue description, it seems like the information about compression is available but not being used correctly.
