I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about Lighthouse reporting that an image (`spritesheet2.png`) could potentially save 53KB, even though the total size of the image is only 54KB. This suggests there's a bug in how the "Properly Size Images" audit calculates potential savings.

Looking at the code in `uses-responsive-images.js`, the issue appears to be in the `computeWaste` function. The function calculates waste based on the ratio of displayed pixels to actual pixels, but it doesn't account for cases where this calculation might result in nearly 100% waste (which would be impossible if the image is actually being used).

The problem is that the calculation doesn't have an upper bound on the waste percentage. If an image is displayed at a much smaller size than its natural dimensions, the calculation could suggest that almost all of the image's bytes are wasted, which isn't realistic.

## Solution

We need to modify the `computeWaste` function to ensure that the calculated waste doesn't exceed a reasonable percentage of the total image size. Since the image is actually being used on the page, it's unreasonable to suggest that nearly 100% of its bytes could be saved.

```javascript
### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const wastedRatio = 1 - (usedPixels / actualPixels);
    const totalBytes = image.resourceSize;
    const wastedBytes = Math.round(totalBytes * wastedRatio);

    // If the image has 0 dimensions, it's probably hidden/offscreen, so let the offscreen-images
    // audit handle it instead.
    if (!usedPixels) {
      return null;
    }
=======
    const wastedRatio = 1 - (usedPixels / actualPixels);
    const totalBytes = image.resourceSize;
    // Cap waste at 85% of the resource size to avoid suggesting impossible savings
    // This prevents cases where an image is technically very oversized but is still needed
    const cappedWastedRatio = Math.min(wastedRatio, 0.85);
    const wastedBytes = Math.round(totalBytes * cappedWastedRatio);

    // If the image has 0 dimensions, it's probably hidden/offscreen, so let the offscreen-images
    // audit handle it instead.
    if (!usedPixels) {
      return null;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change caps the waste ratio at 85%, which means that no matter how much an image is resized, the audit will never suggest that more than 85% of the image's bytes could be saved. This is a reasonable limit since any image being used on the page will need some minimum amount of data to be displayed properly.

The 85% cap is a reasonable value that allows the audit to still flag significantly oversized images while avoiding the unrealistic suggestion that nearly 100% of an image's bytes could be saved.
