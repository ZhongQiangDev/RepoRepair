I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that lines with only spaces are being removed in code blocks, which is problematic for certain programming languages and real-time editing scenarios. This happens because of the line:

```javascript
src = src.replace(/^ +$/gm, '');
```

at the beginning of the `blockTokens` method in `src/Lexer.js`. This regex is removing lines that contain only spaces.

The fix is to modify this line to only apply this replacement when not inside code blocks. However, since the `blockTokens` method is also used recursively for processing nested elements, we need to be careful.

Looking at the issue, the best approach is to remove this line entirely from the `blockTokens` method, as it's causing the undesired behavior and doesn't seem to be necessary for proper markdown parsing (as evidenced by CommonMark's behavior).

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/Lexer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  blockTokens(src, tokens = [], top = true) {
    src = src.replace(/^ +$/gm, '');
    let token, i, l, lastToken;
=======
  blockTokens(src, tokens = [], top = true) {
    let token, i, l, lastToken;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the problematic line that was stripping out lines containing only spaces, which will preserve those spaces in code blocks and other contexts.
