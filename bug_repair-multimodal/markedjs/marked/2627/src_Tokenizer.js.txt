I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about the "Strong" transform (bold text) not being recognized when there's an escaped square open bracket inside the bold text and a closing bracket after the bold text markers.

Looking at the example:
`**strong text\[**\]`

Expected behavior: The text "strong text[" should be rendered as bold, followed by a "]" character.
Current behavior: The bold formatting is not being applied correctly.

The issue is likely in the parsing logic for strong/bold text in the Tokenizer.js file. However, the provided code snippet doesn't include the relevant part that handles strong text formatting.

Since we don't see the specific code for handling strong text in the provided snippet, I'll need to infer where the issue might be. The problem is likely related to how escaped characters are handled within strong text markers.

Based on the issue description, the problem occurs when there's an escaped square bracket `\[` inside bold text. This suggests that the regex pattern used to identify strong text boundaries might not be correctly handling escaped characters.

## Fix Proposal

Since the specific code for handling strong text isn't provided in the snippet, I'll need to make an educated guess about where the issue might be. The most likely place is in a method that handles strong text formatting in the Tokenizer class.

```javascript
### src/Tokenizer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  strong(src) {
    const cap = this.rules.inline.strong.exec(src);
    if (cap) {
      return {
        type: 'strong',
        raw: cap[0],
        text: cap[4] || cap[3] || cap[2] || cap[1],
        tokens: this.lexer.inlineTokens(cap[4] || cap[3] || cap[2] || cap[1])
      };
    }
  }
=======
  strong(src) {
    const cap = this.rules.inline.strong.exec(src);
    if (cap) {
      const text = cap[4] || cap[3] || cap[2] || cap[1];
      return {
        type: 'strong',
        raw: cap[0],
        text: text.replace(/\\([\[\]])/g, '$1'),
        tokens: this.lexer.inlineTokens(text.replace(/\\([\[\]])/g, '$1'))
      };
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a replacement for escaped square brackets in the strong text, similar to how it's done in the `outputLink` function. The `replace(/\\([\[\]])/g, '$1')` pattern will convert escaped brackets `\[` and `\]` to their literal characters `[` and `]` within the strong text.

Note: Without seeing the complete code, this is my best guess at the fix. The actual implementation might require adjustments based on the full context of the Tokenizer class and how it handles strong text formatting.
