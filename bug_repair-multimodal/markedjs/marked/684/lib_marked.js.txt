I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about how Markdown lists are rendered. Specifically:
- When a bulleted list is immediately followed by a numbered list (without any blank lines between them), they're rendered as a single list
- Adding one blank line between them still doesn't separate them properly
- Only adding two blank lines between the lists renders them correctly as separate lists

Looking at the screenshots:
1. First screenshot: Lists are merged incorrectly
2. Second screenshot: Lists are still merged incorrectly with one blank line
3. Third screenshot: Lists are correctly separated with two blank lines

This suggests that the Markdown parser isn't correctly identifying the end of one list and the beginning of another when they're adjacent or separated by just one newline.

## Bug Localization

The issue is in the list parsing logic in `lib/marked.js`. The problem is likely in how the parser identifies the end of a list. Looking at the code, the `list` regex in the `block` object is responsible for determining where a list ends.

The current regex pattern for `list` is:
```javascript
list: /^( *)(bull) [\s\S]+?(?:hr|def|\n{2,}(?! )(?!\1bull )\n*|\s*$)/
```

This pattern is looking for a list to end with either:
- A horizontal rule (`hr`)
- A definition (`def`)
- Two or more newlines (`\n{2,}`) not followed by a space or another list item with the same indentation
- End of string (`\s*$`)

The issue is that it requires at least two newlines (`\n{2,}`) to recognize the end of a list when another list follows. This explains why two blank lines are needed to separate lists.

## Fix

We need to modify the `list` regex to recognize a new list as the end of the previous list, even if there's only one newline between them. The key is to detect when a new list with a different marker type (bullet vs. number) starts.

```javascript
### lib/marked.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
block.list = edit(block.list)
  .replace(/bull/g, block.bullet)
  .replace('hr', '\\n+(?=\\1?(?:(?:- *){3,}|(?:_ *){3,}|(?:\\* *){3,})(?:\\n+|$))')
  .replace('def', '\\n+(?=' + block.def.source + ')')
  .getRegex();
=======
block.list = edit(block.list)
  .replace(/bull/g, block.bullet)
  .replace('hr', '\\n+(?=\\1?(?:(?:- *){3,}|(?:_ *){3,}|(?:\\* *){3,})(?:\\n+|$))')
  .replace('def', '\\n+(?=' + block.def.source + ')')
  .getRegex();

// Fix to allow different list types to be recognized as separate lists
// even when there's only one newline between them
block.list = new RegExp(
  block.list.source.replace('\\n{2,}', '\\n{1,}(?=\\s*(?:[*+-]|\\d+\\.)[^\\n]*\\n)\\n*|\\n{2,}')
);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the list regex after it's initially created. It replaces the `\n{2,}` pattern (which requires at least two newlines) with a pattern that can match either:
1. One or more newlines followed by a new list item with a different marker type, or
2. Two or more newlines (preserving the original behavior for other cases)

This change allows the parser to recognize a new list starting after just one blank line when the list marker type changes (from bullets to numbers or vice versa), which should fix the issue described.
