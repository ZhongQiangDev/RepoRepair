I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is about a table rendering error in Markdown. Looking at the screenshot and expected output, it appears that the pipe character (`|`) in the table cell content is causing problems with the table parsing. Specifically, in the cell containing `string|ReactNode`, the pipe character is being interpreted as a table cell separator rather than part of the content.

The problem is in the `splitCells` function in `lib/marked.js`. The current implementation is using a regular expression that doesn't properly handle escaped pipe characters within table cells.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/marked.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function splitCells(tableRow, count) {
  var cells = tableRow.replace(/([^\\])\|/g, '$1 |').split(/ +\| */),
      i = 0;

  if (cells.length > count) {
    cells.splice(count);
  } else {
    while (cells.length < count) cells.push('');
  }

  for (; i < cells.length; i++) {
    cells[i] = cells[i].replace(/\\\|/g, '|');
  }
  return cells;
}
=======
function splitCells(tableRow, count) {
  // First, handle escaped pipes
  var row = tableRow.replace(/\\\|/g, '\u0000');
  
  // Split on unescaped pipes
  var cells = row.split(/\|/);
  
  // Trim whitespace from cell contents
  for (var i = 0; i < cells.length; i++) {
    cells[i] = cells[i].trim().replace(/\u0000/g, '|');
  }
  
  // Handle spanning cells
  if (cells.length > count) {
    cells.splice(count);
  } else {
    while (cells.length < count) cells.push('');
  }
  
  return cells;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Replaces escaped pipes (`\|`) with a temporary placeholder character (`\u0000`)
2. Splits the row on pipe characters
3. Trims whitespace from each cell
4. Restores the escaped pipes by replacing the placeholder with actual pipe characters
5. Handles the cell count as before

This approach properly preserves escaped pipe characters within table cells, which fixes the rendering issue with `string\|ReactNode` in the table.
