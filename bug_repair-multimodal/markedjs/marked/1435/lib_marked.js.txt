I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about having to escape parentheses in Markdown links. According to the screenshot and description, users need to add a backslash before parentheses in link text, otherwise the parser doesn't handle it correctly.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `inline._label` regular expression which is used for parsing link labels. The current implementation doesn't properly handle parentheses in link text.

The issue is that when a user writes something like `[text with (parentheses)](url)`, the parser gets confused about which parentheses are part of the link text and which ones are delimiting the URL.

## Fix

We need to modify the `inline._label` regular expression to properly handle parentheses in link text. The current implementation allows escaping square brackets but doesn't handle parentheses properly.

```javascript
### lib/marked.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
block._label = /(?!\s*\])(?:\\[\[\]]|[^\[\]])+/;
=======
block._label = /(?!\s*\])(?:\\[\[\]]|\\[\(\)]|[^\[\]])+/;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### lib/marked.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
inline._label = /(?:\[[^\[\]]*\]|\\[\[\]]?|`[^`]*`|`(?!`)|[^\[\]\\`])*?/;
=======
inline._label = /(?:\[[^\[\]]*\]|\\[\[\]]?|\\[\(\)]?|`[^`]*`|`(?!`)|[^\[\]\\`])*?/;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes allow for escaped parentheses in link labels by adding `\\[\(\)]` to the pattern, which matches escaped parentheses like `\(` and `\)`. This way, when users write `[text with \(parentheses\)](url)`, the parser will correctly interpret the escaped parentheses as part of the link text rather than as URL delimiters.
