I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about Markdown image links not rendering correctly when the alt text contains escaped square brackets. Looking at the example:

```md
[![\[Manny Pacquiao\]](https://img.youtube.com/vi/s6bCmZmy9aQ/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/s6bCmZmy9aQ)
```

The problem is in the `outputLink` function in `src/Tokenizer.js`. When processing an image link (starting with `!`), the function is escaping the alt text (`cap[1]`) using the `escape` function. This is causing already escaped characters like `\[` and `\]` to be double-escaped, breaking the rendering.

For image alt text, we shouldn't escape the content that's already properly formatted in Markdown.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/Tokenizer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  } else {
    return {
      type: 'image',
      raw,
      text: escape(cap[1]),
      href,
      title
    };
  }
=======
  } else {
    return {
      type: 'image',
      raw,
      text: cap[1],
      href,
      title
    };
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the `escape()` function call on `cap[1]` for image alt text. Since the alt text is already properly formatted in Markdown, we don't need to escape it again. This will prevent double-escaping of characters like `\[` and `\]`, allowing the image links to render correctly.
