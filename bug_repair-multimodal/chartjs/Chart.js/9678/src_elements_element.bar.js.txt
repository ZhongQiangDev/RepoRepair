I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that since version 3.5.0, the border thickness of charts has increased, making it appear bolder than in previous versions. The user wants to maintain the previous border thickness without affecting the legend border.

Looking at the code, I can see that in the `draw` method of the `BarElement` class, there's an `inflateAmount` constant set to `0.33`. This value is used to inflate the rectangles when drawing the borders, which could be causing the thicker borders observed in the newer versions.

## Solution

The solution is to reduce the `inflateAmount` value to make the borders appear thinner, similar to how they looked in version 3.4.1. This will affect only the chart borders and not the legend borders.

```javascript
### src/elements/element.bar.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const inflateAmount = 0.33;
=======
    const inflateAmount = 0.2;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change reduces the inflation amount from 0.33 to 0.2, which should make the borders appear thinner, closer to how they looked in version 3.4.1. The value 0.2 is chosen as a reasonable middle ground that should provide a border thickness similar to the previous version without making it too thin.

This fix targets only the chart borders and won't affect the legend borders, which is what the user wanted.
