I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the RTL regression in Chart.js v3.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about RTL (right-to-left) support in the legend component of Chart.js v3. In v2, when `rtl: true` was set, the legend would properly display with the box to the right of the text. In v3, the text goes off-screen or isn't rendered at all.

Looking at the code, I can see that the issue is in the `_textX` function usage in the `draw` method of the Legend class. The issue description mentions that `_textX` should be updated to be RTL-aware.

The problem is in this line:
```javascript
x = _textX(textAlign, x + boxWidth + halfFontSize, me.right);
```

This function doesn't properly handle RTL text alignment. When RTL is enabled, the text position calculation needs to be adjusted.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      const realX = rtlHelper.x(x);

      drawLegendBox(realX, y, legendItem);

      x = _textX(textAlign, x + boxWidth + halfFontSize, me.right);

      // Fill the actual label
      fillText(rtlHelper.x(x), y, legendItem);
=======
      const realX = rtlHelper.x(x);

      drawLegendBox(realX, y, legendItem);

      // For RTL the text position needs to be adjusted differently
      const textX = rtlHelper.x(
        textAlign === 'start' ? x + boxWidth + halfFontSize : 
        textAlign === 'end' ? x - halfFontSize : 
        x + boxWidth / 2
      );

      // Fill the actual label
      fillText(textX, y, legendItem);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix changes how the text position is calculated when rendering the legend items. Instead of using the `_textX` helper function which doesn't properly handle RTL, we now use the `rtlHelper.x` function directly with appropriate positioning based on the text alignment.

The new code:
1. Calculates the text position based on the text alignment
2. For 'start' alignment, positions the text after the box (plus half font size)
3. For 'end' alignment, positions the text before the box (minus half font size)
4. For center alignment (default), positions the text at the center of the box
5. Uses the rtlHelper to properly handle RTL text direction

This should fix the RTL regression and ensure that legend text is properly positioned in RTL mode, with the box appearing to the right of the text as expected.
