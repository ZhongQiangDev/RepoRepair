I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue occurs when a pie chart has a specific value (385) while other values are 0, and the `hoverOffset` option is used. When hovering over the chart, the border of the initial circle appears incorrectly.

Looking at the code, the problem is likely in the `drawArc` function. When a pie chart has only one non-zero value, it essentially becomes a full circle. The issue appears to be related to how the arc is drawn when the circumference is close to or equal to a full circle (TAU).

The bug is in the `drawArc` function where it handles full circles. When the circumference is exactly TAU (a full circle), the endAngle calculation can cause rendering issues.

## Fix

```typescript
### src/elements/element.arc.ts
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function drawArc(
  ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D,
  element: ArcElement,
  offset: number,
  spacing: number,
  circular: boolean,
) {
  const {fullCircles, startAngle, circumference} = element;
  let endAngle = element.endAngle;
  if (fullCircles) {
    pathArc(ctx, element, offset, spacing, startAngle + TAU, circular);

    for (let i = 0; i < fullCircles; ++i) {
      ctx.fill();
    }

    if (!isNaN(circumference)) {
      endAngle = startAngle + circumference % TAU;
      if (circumference % TAU === 0) {
        endAngle += TAU;
      }
    }
  }
  pathArc(ctx, element, offset, spacing, endAngle, circular);
  ctx.fill();
  return endAngle;
}

      if (circumference % TAU === 0) {
        endAngle += TAU;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Skip drawing if it's a full circle with no remainder
  if (!(fullCircles && circumference % TAU === 0)) {
    pathArc(ctx, element, offset, spacing, endAngle, circular);
    ctx.fill();
  }
  
  return endAngle;
}

```

This fix addresses the issue by skipping the second drawing operation when we have a full circle with no remainder. In the case of a single value of 385 with other values being 0, the chart is essentially a full circle. The bug occurs because the code was drawing the arc twice in this case - once for the full circle and once for the remainder, even though there was no remainder.

By adding the condition to skip the second drawing when we have a full circle with no remainder, we prevent the visual glitch that occurs when hovering with `hoverOffset` enabled.
