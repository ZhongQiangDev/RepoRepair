I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is with the PolarArea chart when it has only a single element. In this case:
1. The chart renders as a complete circle
2. Only the leading edge (1-2 pixels wide) responds to mouseover events
3. The tooltip doesn't appear when hovering over the colored area

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `inRange` method of the `ArcElement` class. When there's only one element in a PolarArea chart, it creates a full circle (circumference = TAU). The issue is in this line:

```javascript
const betweenAngles = circumference >= TAU || _angleBetween(angle, startAngle, endAngle);
```

When `circumference >= TAU`, it immediately returns `true` for the `betweenAngles` check without actually checking if the angle is between the start and end angles. This is problematic because for a full circle, we still need to check if the point is within the angle range.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/elements/element.arc.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const betweenAngles = circumference >= TAU || _angleBetween(angle, startAngle, endAngle);
=======
    // When the element forms a complete circle, we need special handling
    // to ensure the entire area is interactive
    const betweenAngles = circumference >= TAU ? true : _angleBetween(angle, startAngle, endAngle);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when the element forms a complete circle (circumference >= TAU), the `betweenAngles` check always returns true, making the entire area interactive. This will allow users to hover over any part of the circle and see the tooltip, not just the leading edge.

The fix is simple but effective - it explicitly handles the full circle case by returning true for the angle check, ensuring the entire area is clickable and can show tooltips.
