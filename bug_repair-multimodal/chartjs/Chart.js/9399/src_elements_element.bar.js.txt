I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about bar charts not having 100% width when `categoryPercentage: 1` and `barPercentage: 1` are set. The user wants to create a histogram with connected bars without any space between them.

Looking at the code, the problem appears to be in the `getBarBounds` function in `src/elements/element.bar.js`. When calculating the left and right bounds of a bar, it's using `half = width / 2` and then setting `left = x - half` and `right = x + half`. This creates bars centered at position `x` with width equal to the bar's width property.

However, for histograms where bars should touch each other without gaps, the bars should be positioned differently. The issue is that the current implementation always centers the bars at their x-coordinate, which doesn't allow for perfect alignment when trying to create connected bars.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/elements/element.bar.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function getBarBounds(bar, useFinalPosition) {
  const {x, y, base, width, height} = bar.getProps(['x', 'y', 'base', 'width', 'height'], useFinalPosition);

  let left, right, top, bottom, half;

  if (bar.horizontal) {
    half = height / 2;
    left = Math.min(x, base);
    right = Math.max(x, base);
    top = y - half;
    bottom = y + half;
  } else {
    half = width / 2;
    left = x - half;
    right = x + half;
    top = Math.min(y, base);
    bottom = Math.max(y, base);
  }

  return {left, top, right, bottom};
}
=======
function getBarBounds(bar, useFinalPosition) {
  const {x, y, base, width, height} = bar.getProps(['x', 'y', 'base', 'width', 'height'], useFinalPosition);

  let left, right, top, bottom, half;

  if (bar.horizontal) {
    half = height / 2;
    left = Math.min(x, base);
    right = Math.max(x, base);
    top = y - half;
    bottom = y + half;
  } else {
    // For vertical bars, use the exact x position without centering
    // This allows bars to be positioned next to each other without gaps
    left = x;
    right = x + width;
    top = Math.min(y, base);
    bottom = Math.max(y, base);
  }

  return {left, top, right, bottom};
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the `getBarBounds` function to position vertical bars at their exact x-coordinate instead of centering them. This allows bars to be positioned next to each other without gaps when `categoryPercentage: 1` and `barPercentage: 1` are set.

The fix changes how the left and right bounds are calculated for vertical bars. Instead of centering the bar at position x with width/2 on each side, it now positions the left edge of the bar at x and the right edge at x + width. This should allow bars to touch each other without any gaps, creating the histogram effect the user is looking for.
