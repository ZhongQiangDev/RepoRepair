I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when `includeBounds=false` and `min` and `max` axis limits are defined, sometimes a tick is rendered outside the defined axis limits. This happens especially with small axis limits.

Looking at the code in `src/scales/scale.linearbase.js`, the problem appears to be in the `generateTicks` function. When `maxDefined` is true but `includeBounds` is false, the code still adds the `niceMax` value as a tick at the end of the function:

```javascript
else if (!maxDefined || niceMax === max) {
  ticks.push({value: niceMax});
}
```

This is incorrect because when `includeBounds` is false and `maxDefined` is true, we shouldn't add the `niceMax` value as a tick if it's equal to the max value.

## Fix

```javascript
### src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  } else if (!maxDefined || niceMax === max) {
    ticks.push({value: niceMax});
=======
  } else if (!maxDefined || (niceMax === max && includeBounds)) {
    ticks.push({value: niceMax});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when `includeBounds` is false and `niceMax` equals `max`, we don't add the `niceMax` value as a tick. This matches the proposed fix in the issue, which checks the `includeBounds` flag before adding the final tick.

The fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue. It maintains the existing behavior for all other cases while fixing the edge case where `includeBounds=false` and the max value would be incorrectly included as a tick.
