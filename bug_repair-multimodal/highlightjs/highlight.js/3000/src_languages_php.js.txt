I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that PHP arrow functions (introduced in PHP 7.4) with the syntax `fn($x) => $x + $y` are not being highlighted correctly. The highlighter is treating the variable after the arrow as a title, which is incorrect. This happens because the current implementation doesn't properly handle the arrow function syntax.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the function definition section. The current implementation has a rule for functions that includes both traditional functions and arrow functions, but it doesn't properly handle the case where an arrow function doesn't have a block (curly braces).

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/php.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      {
        className: 'function',
        relevance: 0,
        beginKeywords: 'fn function', end: /[;{]/, excludeEnd: true,
        illegal: '[$%\\[]',
        contains: [
          hljs.UNDERSCORE_TITLE_MODE,
          {
            begin: '=>' // No markup, just a relevance booster
          },
=======
      {
        className: 'function',
        relevance: 0,
        beginKeywords: 'fn function', end: /[;{]/, excludeEnd: true,
        illegal: '[$%\\[]',
        contains: [
          {
            // For arrow functions, only highlight the function keyword, not the name
            className: 'title',
            begin: /[a-zA-Z_]\w*/,
            starts: {
              // Don't include the title in the function if it's an arrow function
              endsWithParent: true,
              excludeEnd: true,
              contains: [
                {
                  begin: '=>',
                  relevance: 10
                }
              ]
            },
            relevance: 0,
            variants: [
              { begin: 'fn(?=\\s*\\()', relevance: 0 }, // Don't match title for arrow functions
              { begin: 'function' }
            ]
          },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix changes how function titles are handled. For traditional functions, it still highlights the function name as a title. For arrow functions (starting with `fn`), it doesn't treat the following code as a title, which prevents the incorrect highlighting of variables after the arrow (`=>`) as titles.
