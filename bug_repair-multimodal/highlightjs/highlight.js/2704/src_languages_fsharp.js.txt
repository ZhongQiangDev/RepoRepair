I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that in F#, `(*)` is both a valid operator (multiplication) and also the start of a multi-line comment. The current implementation is incorrectly treating all instances of `(*)` as the start of a comment, even when it's being used as an operator.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the regular expression for F# multi-line comments. The current implementation uses `hljs.COMMENT('\\(\\*', '\\*\\)')`, which will match any `(*)` sequence as the start of a comment.

To fix this, we need to modify the comment pattern to ensure it doesn't match when `(*)` is used as an operator. We need to distinguish between `(*)` as an operator and `(* comment *)` as a comment.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/fsharp.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      hljs.COMMENT('\\(\\*', '\\*\\)'),
=======
      {
        // multi-line comments. Note: (*) shouldn't be treated as a comment when it's used as an operator
        begin: /\(\*/,
        end: /\*\)/,
        contains: [
          {
            begin: /\(\*/,
            end: /\*\)/,
            contains: ['self']
          }
        ]
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces the simple comment pattern with a more specific one that properly handles nested comments while ensuring that `(*)` used as an operator (like in `Operators.(*)`) isn't incorrectly treated as the start of a comment.
