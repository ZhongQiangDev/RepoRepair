I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that `0` and numbers starting with `0` (like `0123` or `0.3`) are not being properly highlighted as numbers in Elixir code. Looking at the code, the problem is in the NUMBER regex pattern which doesn't account for numbers starting with `0` unless they're explicitly binary, octal, or hexadecimal.

The current regex pattern for numbers is:
```
(\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\b[1-9][0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)'
```

Notice that the decimal integer part starts with `[1-9]`, which excludes `0`. We need to modify this to include `0` as a valid starting digit.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/elixir.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const NUMBER = {
    className: 'number',
    begin: '(\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\b[1-9][0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',
    relevance: 0
  };
=======
  const NUMBER = {
    className: 'number',
    begin: '(\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\b[0-9][0-9_]*(\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',
    relevance: 0
  };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key change is replacing `[1-9]` with `[0-9]` in the decimal integer pattern, which allows `0` to be recognized as a valid starting digit for numbers. This will properly highlight `0` on its own, as well as numbers starting with `0` like `0123` and `0.3`.
