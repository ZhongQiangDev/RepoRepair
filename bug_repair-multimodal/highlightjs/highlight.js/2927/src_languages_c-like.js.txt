I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that when using the `LL` suffix for integer literals in C/C++ code, only the first `L` is being highlighted. This is happening because the regular expression pattern in the `NUMBERS` section doesn't properly handle the `LL` suffix.

Looking at the code, I can see that the number regex pattern in the `NUMBERS` object needs to be updated to properly handle the `LL` suffix. Currently, it's using `(u|U|l|L|ul|UL|f|F|b|B)` which only matches single `L` characters, not the `LL` suffix.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/c-like.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      {
        begin: '(-?)\\b([\\d\']+(\\.[\\d\']*)?|\\.[\\d\']+)(u|U|l|L|ul|UL|f|F|b|B)'
      },
=======
      {
        begin: '(-?)\\b([\\d\']+(\\.[\\d\']*)?|\\.[\\d\']+)(u|U|l|L|ul|UL|ll|LL|f|F|b|B)'
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the `ll` and `LL` suffixes to the list of recognized integer literal suffixes, which will ensure that both L's in the `LL` suffix are properly highlighted.
