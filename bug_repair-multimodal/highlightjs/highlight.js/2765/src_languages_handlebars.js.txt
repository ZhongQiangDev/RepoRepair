I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

The issue is with the Handlebars syntax highlighting for block `if` statements and `else if` conditions. Looking at the screenshot and description, the problem appears to be that the `else if` part is not being properly recognized and highlighted.

The current implementation has a rule for `else` but not for `else if`. When an `else if` appears in the template, only the `else` part is recognized as a keyword, and the rest is treated differently, leading to inconsistent highlighting.

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/handlebars.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      {
        className: 'template-tag',
        begin: /\{\{(?=else\}\})/,
        end: /\}\}/,
        keywords: 'else'
      },
=======
      {
        className: 'template-tag',
        begin: /\{\{(?=else)/,
        end: /\}\}/,
        contains: [
          {
            begin: /else\s+if|else/,
            keywords: 'else if',
            className: 'name'
          },
          HELPER_PARAMETERS
        ]
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the rule for the `else` tag to:
1. Match any tag that starts with `else` (not just exactly `else}}`)
2. Include proper handling for both `else` and `else if` keywords
3. Add support for parameters after the `else if` condition
4. Apply consistent highlighting by using the same className and parameter handling as other blocks

This will ensure that `else if` statements are properly highlighted with the same styling as other Handlebars control structures, and that the parameters following them are also correctly highlighted.
