I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that the LaTeX magic comments should be case insensitive, but currently the regex in the `MAGIC_COMMENT` rule only matches when "TeX" is written exactly as "TeX" (with uppercase T and lowercase e and x). This is why in the example, the second line with "TEX" (uppercase E) is not being highlighted.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `MAGIC_COMMENT` definition:

```javascript
const MAGIC_COMMENT = {
  className: 'meta',
  begin: '% !TeX',
  end: '$',
  relevance: 10
};
```

The fix is to make the regex case insensitive for the "TeX" part. Here's the search/replace edit:

```javascript
### src/languages/latex.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const MAGIC_COMMENT = {
    className: 'meta',
    begin: '% !TeX',
    end: '$',
    relevance: 10
  };
=======
  const MAGIC_COMMENT = {
    className: 'meta',
    begin: /% ![tT][eE][xX]/,
    end: '$',
    relevance: 10
  };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces the string literal with a regular expression that matches "TeX" in any case combination (tEX, TEX, Tex, etc.), which will solve the issue described in the ticket.
