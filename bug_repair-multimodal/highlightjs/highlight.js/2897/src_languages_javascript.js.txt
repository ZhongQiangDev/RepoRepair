I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that empty block comments (`/**/`) in JavaScript are breaking the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code. Looking at the example, when there's an empty block comment like `/**/console.log("Hello, World!")/**/`, the highlighting stops working after the first empty comment.

The problem is in the JavaScript language definition, specifically in how block comments are handled. The current implementation doesn't properly handle empty block comments.

Let's look at the COMMENT definition in the JavaScript language file. The issue is likely in the C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE that's being used.

After examining the code, I can see that the issue is related to how block comments are matched. The standard C-style block comment mode might not be handling empty comments correctly. We need to modify the comment handling to ensure empty block comments are properly recognized.

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/javascript.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const COMMENT = {
    className: "comment",
    variants: [
      JSDOC_COMMENT,
      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE
    ]
  };
=======
  const COMMENT = {
    className: "comment",
    variants: [
      JSDOC_COMMENT,
      {
        begin: '/\\*',
        end: '\\*/',
        contains: ['self']
      },
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE
    ]
  };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix replaces the standard `hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE` with a custom block comment definition that explicitly defines the begin and end patterns for block comments (`/\*` and `\*/`). The addition of `contains: ['self']` allows for nested comments.

The key difference is that our custom implementation will properly handle empty block comments (`/**/`) because it's explicitly looking for the start and end patterns without any assumptions about content in between.
