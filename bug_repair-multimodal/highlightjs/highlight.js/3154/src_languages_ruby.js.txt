I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is about Ruby heredocs without interpolation not being highlighted correctly. In Ruby, a heredoc without interpolation is denoted by single quotes around the delimiter, like `<<-'MESSAGE'`. The current implementation doesn't properly handle this syntax.

Looking at the code, the heredoc handling is in the STRING section, specifically in the variants array. The current implementation only handles standard heredocs but doesn't account for the non-interpolating variant with single quotes.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/ruby.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      { // heredocs
        begin: /<<[-~]?'?(\w+)\n(?:[^\n]*\n)*?\s*\1\b/,
        returnBegin: true,
        contains: [
          {
            begin: /<<[-~]?'?/
          },
          hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({
            begin: /(\w+)/,
            end: /(\w+)/,
            contains: [
              hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,
              SUBST
            ]
          })
        ]
      }
=======
      { // heredocs
        begin: /<<[-~]?'?(\w+)\n(?:[^\n]*\n)*?\s*\1\b/,
        returnBegin: true,
        contains: [
          {
            begin: /<<[-~]?'?/
          },
          hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({
            begin: /(\w+)/,
            end: /(\w+)/,
            contains: [
              hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,
              SUBST
            ]
          })
        ]
      },
      { // heredocs without interpolation (single quotes around delimiter)
        begin: /<<[-~]?'(\w+)'\n(?:[^\n]*\n)*?\s*\1\b/,
        returnBegin: true,
        contains: [
          {
            begin: /<<[-~]?'/
          },
          hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({
            begin: /(\w+)/,
            end: /(\w+)/,
            contains: [
              hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE
              // No SUBST here since there's no interpolation
            ]
          })
        ]
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a new variant specifically for heredocs with single quotes around the delimiter, which indicates no interpolation. The key differences are:
1. The regex pattern now explicitly looks for single quotes around the delimiter
2. The `contains` array for this variant doesn't include `SUBST` since interpolation isn't allowed in this type of heredoc

This should properly highlight the entire heredoc as a string, including the ending delimiter.
