I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that Perl's regex match operator `m` can use arbitrary delimiters, not just slashes. The current implementation only recognizes `m/pattern/` but not other forms like `m(pattern)`, `m{pattern}`, etc.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the regexp definition that handles the `m` operator. Currently, it only matches patterns that start with `(m|qr)?/` which means it only recognizes slash as a delimiter after the `m` operator.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/perl.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        {
          className: 'regexp',
          begin: /(m|qr)?\//,
          end: regex.concat(
            /\//,
            REGEX_MODIFIERS
          ),
          contains: [ hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE ],
          relevance: 0 // allows empty "//" which is a common comment delimiter in other languages
        }

        {
          className: 'regexp',
          // m{...}, m(...), etc.
          begin: regex.concat(
            /(m|qr)(?![a-zA-Z0-9])/,
            /(.)/
          ),
          end: regex.concat(
            /\2/,
            REGEX_MODIFIERS
          ),
          contains: [ hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE ],
          relevance: 0
        },
        {
          className: 'regexp',
          begin: /(m|qr)?\//,
          end: regex.concat(
            /\//,
            REGEX_MODIFIERS
          ),
          contains: [ hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE ],
          relevance: 0 // allows empty "//" which is a common comment delimiter in other languages
        }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a new regexp rule that handles the `m` operator with arbitrary delimiters. The pattern works as follows:

1. It matches `m` or `qr` that is not followed by a letter or number (to avoid matching keywords like "map")
2. It captures the next character as the delimiter
3. It uses the captured delimiter as the end pattern
4. It applies the regex modifiers after the closing delimiter

The original rule for slash-delimited patterns is kept for backward compatibility and because it's a common case.
