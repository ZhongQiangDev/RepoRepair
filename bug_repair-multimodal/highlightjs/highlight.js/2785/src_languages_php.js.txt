I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that PHP variables are not being highlighted properly in code snippets. Looking at the code, I can see that the `VARIABLE` object is defined correctly, but it's missing the `className` property which is needed to apply the proper CSS class for highlighting.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/php.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  var VARIABLE = {
    begin: '\\$+[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*'
  };
=======
  var VARIABLE = {
    className: 'variable',
    begin: '\\$+[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*'
  };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the `className: 'variable'` property to the `VARIABLE` object, which will ensure that PHP variables are properly highlighted with the 'variable' CSS class. This matches the expected behavior shown in the issue's "Expected behavior" screenshot.
