I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that when a comment appears on the same line as a decorator in Python code, the entire line gets the `hljs-meta` class instead of having the comment part properly formatted with the `hljs-comment` class.

Looking at the code, I can see that the decorator is defined in the `contains` array with:

```javascript
{
  className: 'meta',
  begin: /^[\t ]*@/, end: /$/
}
```

The problem is that the `end: /$/` pattern means the decorator's meta styling extends to the end of the line, including any comments. We need to modify this to stop the meta styling when a comment starts.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/python.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      {
        className: 'meta',
        begin: /^[\t ]*@/, end: /$/
      },
=======
      {
        className: 'meta',
        begin: /^[\t ]*@/, end: /(?=#)|$/
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the `end` pattern to stop either when it encounters a `#` character (which starts a comment) or at the end of the line (`$`). The `(?=#)` is a positive lookahead that matches a position right before a `#` character without consuming it, allowing the comment highlighting to take over.
