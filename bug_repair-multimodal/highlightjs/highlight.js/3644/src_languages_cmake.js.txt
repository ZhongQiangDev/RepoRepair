I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the CMake multi-line comment support.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that CMake multi-line comments starting with `#[[` and ending with `]]` are not being properly highlighted. Currently, the code only supports single-line comments using `hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE`, which matches lines starting with `#` but doesn't handle the multi-line comment syntax specific to CMake.

## Solution

We need to add support for CMake's multi-line comment syntax by adding a rule that matches text starting with `#[[` and ending with `]]`. This should be added to the `contains` array in the language definition.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/cmake.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    contains: [
      {
        className: 'variable',
        begin: /\$\{/,
        end: /\}/
      },
      hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.QUOTE_STRING_MODE,
      hljs.NUMBER_MODE
    ]
=======
    contains: [
      {
        className: 'variable',
        begin: /\$\{/,
        end: /\}/
      },
      {
        className: 'comment',
        begin: /#\[\[/,
        end: /\]\]/,
        contains: [hljs.PHRASAL_WORDS_MODE]
      },
      hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.QUOTE_STRING_MODE,
      hljs.NUMBER_MODE
    ]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new rule that specifically handles CMake's multi-line comment syntax. The rule:
1. Uses the `comment` class for proper styling
2. Matches text starting with `#[[` and ending with `]]`
3. Includes `hljs.PHRASAL_WORDS_MODE` to support highlighting of common phrases within comments
4. Keeps the existing single-line comment support via `hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE`

This will ensure that multi-line comments in CMake are properly highlighted as comments.
