I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that empty block comments (`/**/`) in Dart code break syntax highlighting for the rest of the file. Looking at the code, I can see that the problem is in how the C-style block comments are defined in the language definition.

The current implementation uses `hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE` which doesn't properly handle empty block comments. When an empty block comment is encountered, the highlighting stops working for the rest of the file.

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/dart.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE,
      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,
=======
      hljs.C_LINE_COMMENT_MODE,
      {
        className: 'comment',
        begin: /\/\*/,
        end: /\*\//,
        contains: [
          {
            begin: /\*/,
            relevance: 0
          }
        ]
      },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix replaces the standard C block comment mode with a custom implementation that properly handles empty block comments. The custom implementation defines a block comment that:
1. Starts with `/*`
2. Ends with `*/`
3. Can contain any characters including nested `*` characters
4. Properly handles the empty case `/**/`

This should fix the issue where empty block comments break the highlighting for the rest of the file.
