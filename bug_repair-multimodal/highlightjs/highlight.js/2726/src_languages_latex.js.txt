I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix. The problem is that LaTeX code inside braces (`{...}`) is being treated as string literals rather than being properly parsed and highlighted as LaTeX code.

Looking at the code, I can see that in the `COMMAND` definition, when a LaTeX command is encountered, it creates a structure where the content inside braces is treated as a string (with className: 'string'). This is incorrect behavior since the content inside braces should be parsed as regular LaTeX code.

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### src/languages/latex.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            {
              className: 'string', // because it looks like attributes in HTML tags
              variants: [
                {begin: /\[/, end: /\]/},
                {begin: /\{/, end: /\}/}
              ]
            },
=======
            {
              className: 'string', // because it looks like attributes in HTML tags
              variants: [
                {begin: /\[/, end: /\]/}
              ]
            },
            {
              begin: /\{/, end: /\}/,
              contains: ['self']
            },
=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Removes the `{begin: /\{/, end: /\}/}` variant from the 'string' class
2. Creates a new block for braces that contains 'self', which allows recursive parsing of the content inside braces as regular LaTeX code

The 'self' reference allows the parser to recursively apply the same language rules to the content inside braces, which will properly highlight commands, formulas, and other LaTeX elements inside braces.
