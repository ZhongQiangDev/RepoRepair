I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that there's a button inside a button in the multiselect component, which violates the W3C HTML5 spec that states "there must be no interactive content descendant" for a button element. This happens when a user selects one or more items in the multiselect component.

Looking at the code, I can see that in `ListBoxSelection.js`, there are two main rendering paths:

1. When `selectionCount` is truthy (multiple selections), it renders a tag with a close icon that has `role="button"` inside it
2. When `selectionCount` is falsy (single selection), it renders a div with `role="button"`

The problem is that when the component is used within another button element, this creates nested interactive elements, which is not allowed by the HTML5 spec and causes accessibility issues.

## Fix

The solution is to change the `role="button"` to something non-interactive when used for the inner elements. We should use a more appropriate role or no role at all, and handle the click and keyboard events without making it an interactive element.

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      <div
        role="button"
        tabIndex={disabled ? -1 : 0}
        className={`${prefix}--tag__close-icon`}
        onClick={handleOnClick}
        onKeyDown={handleOnKeyDown}
        disabled={disabled}
        aria-label={t('clear.all')}
        title={description}>
        <Close16 />
      </div>
=======
      <div
        className={`${prefix}--tag__close-icon`}
        onClick={handleOnClick}
        onKeyDown={handleOnKeyDown}
        disabled={disabled}
        aria-label={t('clear.all')}
        title={description}>
        <Close16 />
      </div>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    <div
      role="button"
      className={className}
      tabIndex={disabled ? -1 : 0}
      onClick={handleOnClick}
      onKeyDown={handleOnKeyDown}
      aria-label={description}
      title={description}>
      {selectionCount}
      <Close16 />
    </div>
=======
    <div
      className={className}
      onClick={handleOnClick}
      onKeyDown={handleOnKeyDown}
      aria-label={description}
      title={description}>
      {selectionCount}
      <Close16 />
    </div>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the `role="button"` and `tabIndex` attributes from both rendering paths, which will prevent the nested interactive content issue. The parent component that contains this `ListBoxSelection` should already be interactive (likely a button), so we don't need to make these inner elements interactive as well.

Note: We're keeping the click and keyboard event handlers so the functionality still works, but we're removing the attributes that make these elements be treated as interactive controls by assistive technologies.
