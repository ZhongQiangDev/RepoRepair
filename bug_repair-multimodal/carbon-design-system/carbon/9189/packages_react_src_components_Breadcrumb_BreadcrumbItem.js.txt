I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is related to the BreadcrumbItem component in the Carbon Design System. When a BreadcrumbItem contains an OverflowMenu, it should display with a "shark fin" appearance and proper positioning. However, this isn't working correctly.

Looking at the code, the problem is in this condition:
```javascript
if (
  children.type &&
  children.type.displayName !== undefined &&
  children.type.displayName === 'OverflowMenu'
) {
```

The issue description mentions that `createComponentToggle` is causing the problem. This likely means that the OverflowMenu component is being wrapped by a higher-order component that doesn't properly forward the `displayName` property.

The fix would be to modify the condition to be more robust in detecting an OverflowMenu component, even when it's wrapped by another component.

## Fix

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/BreadcrumbItem.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (
    children.type &&
    children.type.displayName !== undefined &&
    children.type.displayName === 'OverflowMenu'
  ) {
=======
  if (
    children.type &&
    (children.type.displayName === 'OverflowMenu' ||
     (children.props && children.props.className && 
      children.props.className.includes(`${prefix}--overflow-menu`)))
  ) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the condition to check not only for the displayName property but also for the presence of the overflow-menu class in the component's className prop. This provides a fallback detection method when the displayName isn't properly set due to component wrapping.

The solution checks if:
1. The original condition is met (displayName is 'OverflowMenu'), OR
2. The component has props with a className that includes the overflow-menu class

This should ensure that the overflow menu is properly styled with the shark fin and correct positioning, even when wrapped by other components like those created with `createComponentToggle`.
