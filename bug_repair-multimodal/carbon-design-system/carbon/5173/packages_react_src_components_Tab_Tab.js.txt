I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that VoiceOver is not announcing the correct tab position (e.g., "tab 2 of 4"). Instead, it always announces "1 of 1" for each tab. This is an accessibility issue that makes it difficult for screen reader users to understand their position within a tab group.

Looking at the code, I can see that the Tab component is missing the `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` attributes, which are needed to properly communicate the tab's position within the set to screen readers.

## Fix

We need to add these ARIA attributes to the tab anchor element. The `index` prop already provides the position information, and we need to add a new prop to pass in the total number of tabs.

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * The index of your Tab in your Tabs. Reserved for usage in Tabs
     */
    index: PropTypes.number,
=======
    /**
     * The index of your Tab in your Tabs. Reserved for usage in Tabs
     */
    index: PropTypes.number,

    /**
     * The total number of Tabs in the Tabs component. Reserved for usage in Tabs
     */
    tabCount: PropTypes.number,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now let's update the component to use this prop:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const {
      id,
      className,
      handleTabClick,
      handleTabKeyDown,
      disabled,
      href,
      index,
      label,
      selected,
      tabIndex,
      onClick,
      onKeyDown,
      renderAnchor,
      renderContent, // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
      ...other
    } = this.props;
=======
    const {
      id,
      className,
      handleTabClick,
      handleTabKeyDown,
      disabled,
      href,
      index,
      tabCount,
      label,
      selected,
      tabIndex,
      onClick,
      onKeyDown,
      renderAnchor,
      renderContent, // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars
      ...other
    } = this.props;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, let's add the ARIA attributes to the anchor element:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const anchorProps = {
      id,
      className: `${prefix}--tabs__nav-link`,
      href,
      role: 'tab',
      tabIndex: !disabled ? tabIndex : -1,
      ['aria-selected']: selected,
      ['aria-disabled']: disabled,
      ['aria-controls']: id && `${id}__panel`,
      ref: e => {
        this.tabAnchor = e;
      },
    };
=======
    const anchorProps = {
      id,
      className: `${prefix}--tabs__nav-link`,
      href,
      role: 'tab',
      tabIndex: !disabled ? tabIndex : -1,
      ['aria-selected']: selected,
      ['aria-disabled']: disabled,
      ['aria-controls']: id && `${id}__panel`,
      ['aria-posinset']: index !== undefined ? index + 1 : undefined,
      ['aria-setsize']: tabCount,
      ref: e => {
        this.tabAnchor = e;
      },
    };
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that VoiceOver correctly announces the tab position (e.g., "tab 2 of 4") when navigating through tabs. The `aria-posinset` attribute indicates the position of the tab within the set, and `aria-setsize` indicates the total number of tabs in the set.

Note that I've added `index + 1` for `aria-posinset` because array indices are typically 0-based, but ARIA positions are 1-based. I've also added a check to only set this attribute if the index is defined.
