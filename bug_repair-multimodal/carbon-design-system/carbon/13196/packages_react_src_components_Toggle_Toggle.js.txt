I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

The bug is related to the `hideLabel` prop in the Toggle component. According to the issue:

1. The documentation for `hideLabel` is unclear
2. Currently, `hideLabel` only fully hides the label when used in conjunction with `aria-labelledby`
3. The behavior is confusing - setting `hideLabel={true}` moves the label to the side rather than hiding it completely

Looking at the code, I can see that:
- The `renderSideLabel` variable is only false when both `hideLabel` and `ariaLabelledby` are true
- The `labelText` prop is missing its PropTypes documentation
- The documentation for `hideLabel` could be clearer about its behavior

Here are the fixes:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * If true, the side labels (props.labelA and props.labelB) will be replaced by
   * props.labelText, so that the toggle doesn't render a top label. In order to fully
   * hide any labels, you can use props['aria-labelledby'] to refer to another element
   * that labels the toggle. props.labelText would no longer be required in that case
   * and can therefore be omitted.
   */
  hideLabel: PropTypes.bool,
=======
  /**
   * If true, the side labels (props.labelA and props.labelB) will be replaced by
   * props.labelText, and the top label will be visually hidden.
   * 
   * Note: To completely hide all labels (including the side label), you must:
   * 1. Set hideLabel={true}
   * 2. Provide an aria-labelledby prop that references another element
   * 
   * Without aria-labelledby, the labelText will still appear as a side label
   * for accessibility reasons.
   */
  hideLabel: PropTypes.bool,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Provide the text that will be read by a screen reader when visiting this
   * control. This is required unless 'aria-labelledby' is provided instead
   */

=======
  /**
   * Provide the text that will be read by a screen reader when visiting this
   * control. This is required unless 'aria-labelledby' is provided instead.
   * When hideLabel is true, this text will appear as a side label unless
   * aria-labelledby is also provided.
   */
  labelText: PropTypes.node,

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const renderSideLabel = !(hideLabel && ariaLabelledby);
=======
  // Only completely hide the side label when both hideLabel and ariaLabelledby are provided
  const renderSideLabel = !(hideLabel && ariaLabelledby);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes:
1. Improve the documentation for the `hideLabel` prop to clearly explain its behavior and requirements
2. Add the missing PropTypes documentation for the `labelText` prop
3. Add a clarifying comment about the side label rendering logic

The changes maintain the current functionality while making the behavior more transparent to developers through improved documentation.
