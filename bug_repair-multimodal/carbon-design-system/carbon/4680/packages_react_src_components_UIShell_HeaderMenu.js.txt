I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that the `HeaderMenu` component is created using `React.forwardRef()` but doesn't have a `displayName` set. This causes it to appear as "Anonymous" in React DevTools, making debugging more difficult.

According to the issue description and screenshots, both `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components have this problem. The code snippet only shows the `HeaderMenu` component, so I'll focus on fixing that one.

## Solution

I need to add a `displayName` property to the forwarded ref component. This should be done after the component is defined using `React.forwardRef()`.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export default React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <HeaderMenu {...props} focusRef={ref} />;
});
=======
const HeaderMenuForwardRef = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <HeaderMenu {...props} focusRef={ref} />;
});

HeaderMenuForwardRef.displayName = 'HeaderMenu';

export default HeaderMenuForwardRef;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Assigns the forwarded ref component to a variable (`HeaderMenuForwardRef`)
2. Sets the `displayName` property to 'HeaderMenu'
3. Exports the named component

With this change, the component will appear as "HeaderMenu" in React DevTools instead of "Anonymous", making debugging easier.

Note: The same pattern should be applied to the `SideNavMenu` component, but since that code wasn't provided in the snippets, I can't create a specific fix for it.
