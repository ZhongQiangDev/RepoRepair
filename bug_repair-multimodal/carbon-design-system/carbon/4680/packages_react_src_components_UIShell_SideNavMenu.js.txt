I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that the `SideNavMenu` component is created using `React.forwardRef()` but doesn't have a `displayName` set. This causes it to appear as "Anonymous" in React DevTools, making debugging more difficult.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export default React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <SideNavMenu {...props} buttonRef={ref} />;
});
=======
const ForwardRefSideNavMenu = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <SideNavMenu {...props} buttonRef={ref} />;
});

ForwardRefSideNavMenu.displayName = 'SideNavMenu';

export default ForwardRefSideNavMenu;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Assigns the forwarded ref component to a variable (`ForwardRefSideNavMenu`)
2. Sets the `displayName` property to "SideNavMenu"
3. Exports the named component

This will ensure the component appears with its proper name in React DevTools instead of showing as "Anonymous".

Note: The issue also mentions `HeaderMenu` having the same problem, but that file wasn't provided in the code segments. A similar fix would be needed for that component as well.
