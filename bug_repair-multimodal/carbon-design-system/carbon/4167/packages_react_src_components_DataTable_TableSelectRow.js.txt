I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that the `TableSelectRow` component in React is not applying the CSS class `bx--table-column-checkbox` to the table cell (`<td>`) that contains the checkbox. This is causing a height discrepancy between the Carbon Design System example (48px) and the React implementation (52px).

Looking at the code, we can see that the `TableSelectRow` component renders a `<td>` element with a custom `className` prop, but it doesn't include the required `bx--table-column-checkbox` class by default.

## Fix

We need to modify the `TableSelectRow.js` file to ensure the `bx--table-column-checkbox` class is always applied to the table cell, while still allowing custom classes to be added.

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectRow.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  return (
    <td className={className}>
      <InlineInputComponent
=======
  return (
    <td className={`bx--table-column-checkbox ${className || ''}`}>
      <InlineInputComponent
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the required `bx--table-column-checkbox` class to the `<td>` element while preserving any custom classes passed through the `className` prop. The `|| ''` ensures that if no `className` is provided, we don't end up with "undefined" in the class string.

This fix will ensure that the row height matches the 48px height shown in the Carbon Design System example.
