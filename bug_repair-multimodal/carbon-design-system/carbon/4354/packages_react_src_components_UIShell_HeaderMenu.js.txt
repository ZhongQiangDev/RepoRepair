I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is in the `HeaderMenu.js` file where the component uses `href="javascript:void(0)"` in an anchor tag. React is warning that this type of JavaScript URL will be blocked in future versions of React for security reasons. The issue suggests replacing it with `href="#"` to resolve the warning.

The problematic line is in the render method of the HeaderMenu component, where the anchor tag is defined with `href="javascript:void(0)"`.

## Fix

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
          className={`${prefix}--header__menu-item ${prefix}--header__menu-title`}
          href="javascript:void(0)"
          onKeyDown={this.handleOnKeyDown}
=======
          className={`${prefix}--header__menu-item ${prefix}--header__menu-title`}
          href="#"
          onKeyDown={this.handleOnKeyDown}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces the JavaScript URL with a simple hash URL (`#`), which will prevent the React warning while maintaining similar behavior. The hash URL will still allow the component to handle the click event without navigating away from the current page.
