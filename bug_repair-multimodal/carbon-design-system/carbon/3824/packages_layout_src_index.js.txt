I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, there's a discrepancy between the documentation/design specs and the actual code implementation. According to the documentation and Sketch files, the margin for the "max" breakpoint should be 24px, but in the code, it's set to 16px.

Looking at the code in `packages/layout/src/index.js`, I can see that in the `breakpoints` object, the `max` breakpoint has a margin of `rem(16)`, which needs to be changed to `rem(24)` to match the documentation.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### packages/layout/src/index.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  max: {
    width: rem(1584),
    columns: 16,
    margin: rem(16),
  },
=======
  max: {
    width: rem(1584),
    columns: 16,
    margin: rem(24),
  },
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the margin for the max breakpoint from 16px to 24px, which aligns with the documentation and design specs shown in the issue.
