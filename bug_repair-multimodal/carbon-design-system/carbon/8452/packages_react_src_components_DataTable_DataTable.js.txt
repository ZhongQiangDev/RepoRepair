I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is requesting to add a 40px (`md`) row height option to the DataTable component. Currently, the component has size options of 'compact', 'short', 'normal', and 'tall', but it's missing the 'md' size that's available in other components.

Looking at the code, I need to:

1. Add 'md' to the PropTypes for the `size` prop
2. Ensure the default value is still 'normal'

## Solution

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    /**
     * `normal` Change the row height of table
     */
    size: PropTypes.oneOf(['compact', 'short', 'normal', 'tall']),
=======
    /**
     * `normal` Change the row height of table
     */
    size: PropTypes.oneOf(['compact', 'short', 'normal', 'md', 'tall']),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the 'md' option to the size prop types, which will allow users to specify a 40px row height for the DataTable component. The default value will remain 'normal' as it's already set in the defaultProps object.

The implementation follows the pattern shown in the issue, where 'md' is added as an option alongside the existing size variants. This matches the approach used in other components that offer size variants, as mentioned in the issue description.
