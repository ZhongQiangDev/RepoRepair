I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the DAP (Digital Accessibility Platform) violations in the ListBoxField component.

Looking at the screenshots from the issue, there are accessibility violations related to the dropdown component. The main issue appears to be with the ARIA attributes in the ListBoxField component.

The specific problems I can identify:
1. The component is using `role="combobox"` but is missing required ARIA attributes for this role
2. There are issues with the aria-controls and aria-owns attributes

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxField.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  <div
    role={rest['aria-expanded'] ? 'combobox' : rest.role || 'combobox'}
    aria-owns={(rest['aria-expanded'] && `${id}__menu`) || null}
    aria-controls={(rest['aria-expanded'] && `${id}__menu`) || null}
    className={`${prefix}--list-box__field`}
    tabIndex={(!disabled && tabIndex) || -1}
    {...rest}
    aria-label={rest['aria-expanded'] ? t('close.menu') : t('open.menu')}>
=======
  <div
    role="button"
    aria-haspopup="listbox"
    aria-expanded={rest['aria-expanded'] || false}
    aria-owns={rest['aria-expanded'] ? `${id}__menu` : null}
    aria-controls={rest['aria-expanded'] ? `${id}__menu` : null}
    className={`${prefix}--list-box__field`}
    tabIndex={(!disabled && tabIndex) || -1}
    {...rest}
    aria-label={rest['aria-expanded'] ? t('close.menu') : t('open.menu')}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix addresses the DAP violations by:

1. Changing the role from "combobox" to "button" with aria-haspopup="listbox" - this is a more appropriate pattern for a dropdown trigger
2. Explicitly setting aria-expanded to either the provided value or false (rather than omitting it)
3. Maintaining the aria-owns and aria-controls attributes but ensuring they're properly set based on the expanded state
4. Keeping the existing aria-label that changes based on the expanded state

This approach follows ARIA best practices for dropdown menus and should resolve the accessibility violations shown in the screenshots.
