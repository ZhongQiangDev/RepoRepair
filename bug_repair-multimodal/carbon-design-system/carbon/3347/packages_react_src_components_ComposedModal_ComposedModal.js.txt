I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is in the `ModalFooter` component of the `ComposedModal`. When the `danger` property is set to `true`, the secondary button (left button) is being styled with `kind="tertiary"` (gray) instead of `kind="secondary"` (black) as expected.

Looking at the screenshots provided in the issue:
1. In the Modal component, the left button is black when danger=true
2. In the ComposedModal component, the left button is gray when danger=true

The issue is in this line of the `ModalFooter` component:
```javascript
kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}
```

This is causing the secondary button to be styled as tertiary (gray) when danger=true, but it should be styled as secondary (black) to match the Modal component's behavior.

## Fix

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}>
=======
            kind="secondary">
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the secondary button (left button) in the ComposedModal will always have `kind="secondary"` (black), regardless of whether the danger property is true or false. This matches the behavior of the Modal component as shown in the first screenshot.
