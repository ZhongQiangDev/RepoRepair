I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the color contrast problem in the Search component.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about color contrast in the Search component's cancel button. When Chrome applies its auto-fill background color (skyblue), the cancel icon button doesn't have enough contrast against this background. This happens when Chrome auto-fills the search input field.

Looking at the code, I need to add a style to ensure the cancel button (close icon) has proper contrast against any background, including Chrome's auto-fill background.

## Solution

The fix involves adding a specific style to the close button to ensure it maintains proper contrast against Chrome's auto-fill background. We need to modify the button's styling in the render method.

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Search/Search.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <button
          className={clearClasses}
          onClick={this.clearInput}
          type="button"
          aria-label={closeButtonLabelText}>
          <CloseIconX />
        </button>
=======
        <button
          className={clearClasses}
          onClick={this.clearInput}
          type="button"
          aria-label={closeButtonLabelText}
          style={{ backgroundColor: 'transparent' }}>
          <CloseIconX />
        </button>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a transparent background to the close button, which will ensure that the button's background doesn't inherit Chrome's auto-fill background color. The transparent background will allow the button's icon to maintain proper contrast against any background, including Chrome's skyblue auto-fill background.
