I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when `pagesUnknown` is set to `true`, the pagination component shows redundant information. Specifically, the page number appears twice:
1. Once in the select dropdown (which is correct)
2. Again in the text that follows the dropdown (which is redundant)

Looking at the code, I can see that when `pagesUnknown` is true, the component renders:
```jsx
<span className={`${prefix}--pagination__text`}>
  {pagesUnknown ? pageText(page) : pageRangeText(page, totalPages)}
</span>
```

The `pageText` function is defined as:
```jsx
pageText = (page) => `page ${page}`
```

This is what's causing the redundancy. When `pagesUnknown` is true, it shows "page X" right after the dropdown that already shows the page number.

## Fix

The fix is to modify the component to not display redundant information when `pagesUnknown` is true. We should either:
1. Not show any text after the dropdown when `pagesUnknown` is true, or
2. Show a different text that doesn't repeat the page number

Let's implement option 1 since it's cleaner:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <span className={`${prefix}--pagination__text`}>
          {pagesUnknown ? pageText(page) : pageRangeText(page, totalPages)}
        </span>
=======
        {!pagesUnknown && (
          <span className={`${prefix}--pagination__text`}>
            {pageRangeText(page, totalPages)}
          </span>
        )}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the redundant text when `pagesUnknown` is true, while maintaining the original behavior when `pagesUnknown` is false. When `pagesUnknown` is true, only the dropdown with the page number will be shown, without the additional text that repeats the page number.
