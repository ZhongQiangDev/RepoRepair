I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the accessibility violation in the FileUploaderDropContainer component.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that the component has nested interactive controls, which violates WCAG accessibility guidelines. Specifically:

1. There's a `<div>` with `role="button"` that contains an `<input type="file">` element
2. This nesting of interactive elements causes the axe-core accessibility test to fail
3. The violation is related to WCAG 2.1 checkpoint 4.1.2

Looking at the code, the problem is in the JSX structure:
- The component renders a `<label>` element
- Inside the label is a `<div>` with `role="button"`
- Inside that div is an `<input type="file">` element

This creates nested interactive controls, which is problematic for accessibility.

## Solution

The fix is to remove the `role="button"` from the div that contains the input element. The label element already provides the interactive functionality needed, and it's properly associated with the input through the `htmlFor` attribute.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderDropContainer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <div className={dropareaClasses} role={role || 'button'}>
=======
        <div className={dropareaClasses}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the redundant `role="button"` from the div, which eliminates the nested interactive controls issue while maintaining the component's functionality. The label element already provides the interactive behavior needed for accessibility.
