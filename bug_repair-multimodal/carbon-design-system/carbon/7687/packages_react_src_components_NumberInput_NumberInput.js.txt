I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about exploring other control options for the NumberInput component besides the up/down carets. Based on the issue reference and the final decision link, it appears that the team wants to update the control UI for the NumberInput component.

Looking at the code, I can see that the NumberInput component currently uses `CaretUpGlyph` and `CaretDownGlyph` icons for the increment and decrement buttons. The issue suggests exploring alternatives to these carets.

## Solution

I need to update the icons used in the NumberInput component. Based on the Carbon Design System standards, we should replace the caret icons with more appropriate icons for increment and decrement operations.

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import {
  WarningFilled16,
  WarningAltFilled16,
  CaretDownGlyph,
  CaretUpGlyph,
} from '@carbon/icons-react';
=======
import {
  WarningFilled16,
  WarningAltFilled16,
  Add16,
  Subtract16,
} from '@carbon/icons-react';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                      <CaretDownGlyph className="down-icon" />
=======
                      <Subtract16 className="down-icon" />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                      <CaretUpGlyph className="up-icon" />
=======
                      <Add16 className="up-icon" />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                      <CaretUpGlyph className="up-icon" />
=======
                      <Add16 className="up-icon" />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                      <CaretDownGlyph className="down-icon" />
=======
                      <Subtract16 className="down-icon" />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces the caret icons with more appropriate icons for increment and decrement operations:
1. `CaretUpGlyph` is replaced with `Add16` (a plus icon)
2. `CaretDownGlyph` is replaced with `Subtract16` (a minus icon)

These icons better represent the actions of incrementing and decrementing a number value, making the UI more intuitive for users. This aligns with the issue's goal of exploring better control options for the NumberInput component.
