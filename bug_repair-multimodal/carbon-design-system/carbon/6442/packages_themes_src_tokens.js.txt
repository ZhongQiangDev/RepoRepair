I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue states that the `ContentSwitcher` component doesn't contrast well on `ui-01` backgrounds. The suggestion is to either adjust the tokens or add a `light` prop/variant similar to what exists in the `TextInput` component.

Looking at the provided code, I can see this is from the tokens.js file which defines all the color tokens used in the Carbon Design System. The issue is likely that the ContentSwitcher component is using tokens that don't provide enough contrast when placed on a ui-01 background.

## Solution

To address this issue, we need to add a new token specifically for the ContentSwitcher component when it's used on light backgrounds. This would be similar to how other components handle light variants.

I'll add a new token called `contentSwitcherLight` to the colors array, which will be used when the ContentSwitcher is on a light background.

```javascript
### packages/themes/src/tokens.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  'interactive01',
  'interactive02',
  'interactive03',
  'interactive04',

  'uiBackground',
=======
  'interactive01',
  'interactive02',
  'interactive03',
  'interactive04',

  'contentSwitcherLight',

  'uiBackground',
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

We also need to add this new token to the meta information so it's properly documented and categorized:

```javascript
### packages/themes/src/tokens.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        'interactive01',
        'interactive02',
        'interactive03',
        'interactive04',
        'brand01',
=======
        'interactive01',
        'interactive02',
        'interactive03',
        'interactive04',
        'contentSwitcherLight',
        'brand01',
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

With these changes, theme implementers can define a specific color for the ContentSwitcher when it's used on light backgrounds, and the ContentSwitcher component can be updated to use this token when a `light` prop is provided.

Note: This is just the first part of the solution. After adding these tokens, the ContentSwitcher component would need to be updated to use the new token when a `light` prop is provided. However, since the ContentSwitcher component code wasn't provided in the issue, I'm focusing on adding the necessary token that would enable such functionality.
