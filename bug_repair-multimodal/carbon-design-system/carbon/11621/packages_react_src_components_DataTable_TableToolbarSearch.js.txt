I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description and screenshots, there's a misalignment with the search icon in the DataTable selection variant. The issue occurs when hovering over the search icon button.

Looking at the code, the problem is likely in the `TableToolbarSearch.js` file. The issue appears to be related to styling classes. The search icon misalignment happens because the component doesn't have proper styling for the expandable search container.

Let's fix this issue:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarSearch.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const searchClasses = cx(className, {
    [searchContainerClass]: searchContainerClass,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-active`]: expanded,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-disabled`]: disabled,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-expandable`]: !persistent,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-persistent`]: persistent,
  });
=======
  const searchClasses = cx(className, {
    [searchContainerClass]: searchContainerClass,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-active`]: expanded,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-disabled`]: disabled,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-expandable`]: !persistent,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container-persistent`]: persistent,
    [`${prefix}--toolbar-search-container`]: true,
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the base class `${prefix}--toolbar-search-container` to the search component, which ensures proper styling and alignment of the search icon, especially during hover states. The issue was that this base class was missing, causing the icon to be misaligned when hovering over the search button.
