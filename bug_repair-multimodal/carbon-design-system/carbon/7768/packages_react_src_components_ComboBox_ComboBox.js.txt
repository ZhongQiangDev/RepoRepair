I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that VoiceOver on Mac is reading dropdown items twice when navigating through them. This is a common accessibility issue that occurs when elements have redundant or duplicate accessibility information.

Looking at the code, I can see that in the `ComboBox.js` file, when rendering the menu items, there are potentially duplicate accessibility attributes that could cause screen readers to announce items twice:

1. The `aria-current` and `aria-selected` attributes are both being used on menu items
2. The `title` attribute is being set, which can cause additional announcements
3. The content is being rendered both as a title and as content

## Solution

The main fix is to remove the redundant `title` attribute from the `ListBox.MenuItem` component. This attribute is causing VoiceOver to read the item twice - once for the title and once for the content.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                              isHighlighted={
                                highlightedIndex === index ||
                                (selectedItem && selectedItem.id === item.id) ||
                                false
                              }
                              title={
                                itemToElement ? item.text : itemToString(item)
                              }
                              {...itemProps}>
=======
                              isHighlighted={
                                highlightedIndex === index ||
                                (selectedItem && selectedItem.id === item.id) ||
                                false
                              }
                              {...itemProps}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change removes the redundant `title` attribute from the menu items. The screen reader will now only read the content of the menu item once, which is provided by either the `ItemToElement` component or the `itemToString` function.

The content itself is already accessible to screen readers, and adding a title attribute creates redundancy that causes VoiceOver to read the same information twice.
