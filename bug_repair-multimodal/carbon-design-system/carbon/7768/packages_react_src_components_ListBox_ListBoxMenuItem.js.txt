I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that VoiceOver on Mac is reading dropdown items twice when navigating through them. This is likely because the `ListBoxMenuItem` component is missing its actual implementation, which should include proper ARIA attributes to prevent screen readers from announcing items twice.

Looking at the code, I notice that the `ListBoxMenuItem` component is defined with PropTypes and defaultProps, but the actual component implementation is missing. This is a critical bug as it means the component isn't properly rendering with the necessary accessibility attributes.

## Fix

I need to add the actual implementation of the `ListBoxMenuItem` component with proper ARIA attributes:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * `ListBoxMenuItem` is a helper component for managing the container class
 * name, alongside any classes for any corresponding states, for a generic list
 * box menu item.
 */


=======
/**
 * `ListBoxMenuItem` is a helper component for managing the container class
 * name, alongside any classes for any corresponding states, for a generic list
 * box menu item.
 */
const ListBoxMenuItem = ({
  children,
  isActive,
  isHighlighted,
  ...rest
}) => {
  const className = cx(
    `${prefix}--list-box__menu-item`,
    {
      [`${prefix}--list-box__menu-item--active`]: isActive,
      [`${prefix}--list-box__menu-item--highlighted`]: isHighlighted,
    }
  );

  return (
    <div
      className={className}
      role="option"
      aria-selected={isActive}
      {...rest}>
      <div className={`${prefix}--list-box__menu-item__option`}>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the actual component implementation that was missing. The key accessibility improvements are:

1. Adding `role="option"` to properly identify the element as an option in a list
2. Adding `aria-selected` attribute to indicate selection state
3. Properly structuring the component with appropriate class names

These changes will prevent VoiceOver from reading the items twice because the screen reader will now have the proper semantic information about the component's role and state.
