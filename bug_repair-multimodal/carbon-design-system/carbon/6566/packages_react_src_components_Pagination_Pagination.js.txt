I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that the pagination component overflows its container on smaller viewports (but above 42rem). Looking at the screenshots, we can see that the pagination controls extend beyond the container's width, causing a horizontal overflow.

The problem is that the pagination component doesn't have proper styling to handle overflow in smaller viewports. When the container is too small, the pagination controls should either wrap or become scrollable within the container.

## Solution

We need to modify the Pagination component to handle overflow properly. The best approach is to add CSS that allows the pagination component to handle smaller viewports by making it responsive.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const classNames = classnames(`${prefix}--pagination`, className);
=======
    const classNames = classnames(`${prefix}--pagination`, className, {
      [`${prefix}--pagination--mobile`]: true,
    });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a mobile-specific class to the pagination component, which will allow us to target it with responsive CSS. The Carbon Design System likely already has styles for this class that will handle the overflow properly.

If this doesn't fully resolve the issue, we might need to add additional CSS to the component or its container to ensure proper overflow handling, such as:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      <div className={classNames} {...other}>
=======
      <div className={classNames} style={{ overflowX: 'auto' }} {...other}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This second change adds an inline style to make the pagination container horizontally scrollable when content overflows, which would prevent the overflow issue shown in the screenshots.
