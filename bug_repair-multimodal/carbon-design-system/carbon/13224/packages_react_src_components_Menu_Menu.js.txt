I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, the problem is related to a "combo button" or "contextual menu" component. The issue shows a screenshot of a command menu and mentions that there are three actions a user can take, but displaying all three by default would take up too much space in the navigation.

Looking at the provided code, I can see this is a Menu component implementation. The bug appears to be in the `calculatePosition` function where the position is reset when the menu is closed. The current implementation sets the position to `[-1, -1]` but then tries to use these values as separate arguments in `setPosition(-1, -1)` instead of as an array.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    } else {
      // reset position when menu is closed in order for the --shown
      // modifier to be applied correctly
      setPosition(-1, -1);
    }
=======
    } else {
      // reset position when menu is closed in order for the --shown
      // modifier to be applied correctly
      setPosition([-1, -1]);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when the menu is closed, the position state is properly reset as an array `[-1, -1]` rather than trying to pass two separate arguments to the `setPosition` function, which expects a single array argument.
