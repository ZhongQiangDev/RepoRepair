I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the React ComboBox component.

## Issue Analysis

Based on the issue description and screenshots:

1. The ComboBox selection element is showing multiselect styles when it shouldn't
2. The invalid state selection icon is positioned incorrectly

Looking at the code, I can see that the issue is in the `render` method of the ComboBox component. The problem appears to be with the `ListBox.Selection` component that's being rendered when there's an input value. This component is likely styled for multiselect functionality, but in this case, it should be styled for single selection.

## Fix

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
              {inputValue && (
                <ListBox.Selection
                  clearSelection={clearSelection}
                  translateWithId={translateWithId}
                />
              )}
=======
              {inputValue && (
                <ListBox.Selection
                  clearSelection={clearSelection}
                  translateWithId={translateWithId}
                  disabled={disabled}
                  selectionCount={1}
                />
              )}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds two important props to the `ListBox.Selection` component:

1. `disabled={disabled}` - This ensures the disabled state is properly passed to the selection component
2. `selectionCount={1}` - This explicitly tells the component that it's dealing with a single selection, not multiple selections, which should fix the styling issues

The invalid icon positioning issue should also be resolved with this change, as the selection component will now render with the correct styles for a single selection.
