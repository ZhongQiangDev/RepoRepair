I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the React ComboBox selection element styles.

## Bug Analysis

Based on the issue description and screenshots:

1. The ComboBox selection element is incorrectly showing multiselect styles when it shouldn't
2. The invalid state selection icon is positioned incorrectly

Looking at the code, I can see the issue is in the `ListBoxSelection.js` file. The component is always applying the `${prefix}--tag--filter` class, which is causing the multiselect styling to appear even for single selections. Additionally, the conditional class for multi-selection is not being applied correctly.

## Fix

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxSelection.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  const className = cx(
    `${prefix}--tag--filter`,
    `${prefix}--list-box__selection`,
    {
      [`${prefix}--list-box__selection--multi`]: selectionCount,
    }
  );
=======
  const className = cx(`${prefix}--list-box__selection`, {
    [`${prefix}--tag--filter`]: selectionCount,
    [`${prefix}--list-box__selection--multi`]: selectionCount,
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix:
1. Removes the unconditional application of the `${prefix}--tag--filter` class
2. Makes the `${prefix}--tag--filter` class conditional on having a `selectionCount`
3. Keeps the multi-selection class conditional on having a `selectionCount`

This will ensure that the tag filter styles (which include the rounded appearance and badge-like styling) are only applied when there are multiple selections, fixing both the visual appearance of the selection element and the positioning of the icon.
