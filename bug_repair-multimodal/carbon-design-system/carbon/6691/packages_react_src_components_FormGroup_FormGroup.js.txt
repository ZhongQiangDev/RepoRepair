I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Bug Localization

The issue is in the `FormGroup` component's PropTypes definition. Currently, the `legendText` prop is defined as `PropTypes.string.isRequired`, which means it only accepts string values. However, the user wants to pass a React element (specifically a `Tooltip` component) as the `legendText` prop, which is causing the PropType warning.

The solution is to update the PropTypes definition to accept both strings and React nodes for the `legendText` prop, similar to how it's implemented in other components like `TextInput`.

## Fix

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Provide the text to be rendered inside of the fieldset <legend>
   */
  legendText: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
=======
  /**
   * Provide the content to be rendered inside of the fieldset <legend>
   */
  legendText: PropTypes.oneOfType([PropTypes.string, PropTypes.node]).isRequired,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change modifies the PropTypes definition for the `legendText` prop to accept either a string or a React node, which will allow users to pass components like `Tooltip` as the `legendText`. I've also updated the JSDoc comment to reflect that it can now be any content, not just text.
