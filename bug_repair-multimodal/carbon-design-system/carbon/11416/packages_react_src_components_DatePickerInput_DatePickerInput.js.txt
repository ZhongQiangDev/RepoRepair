I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the error message and issue description, the problem occurs when `datePickerType="single"` is used with the DatePicker component. The error specifically mentions:

```
TypeError: start.addEventListener is not a function. (In 'start.addEventListener('keydown', handleArrowDown)', 'start.addEventListener' is undefined)
```

Looking at the code, I notice that the `datePickerType` prop is defined in the `DatePickerInput` component, but it's not being used correctly. The issue is likely that the DatePicker component is trying to access DOM elements that don't exist when the type is "single".

However, the issue is not in the `DatePickerInput.js` file you provided. The error is occurring in the `DatePicker.js` file at line 316, where it's trying to add an event listener to an element that doesn't exist.

Since you haven't provided the `DatePicker.js` file, I can't provide a direct fix for that file. However, based on the error message and common patterns, I can suggest a likely fix:

The issue is probably that when `datePickerType="single"` is used, the code is trying to add event listeners to DOM elements that don't exist yet or are not properly initialized. The fix would involve checking if the element exists before adding event listeners.

Without seeing the actual `DatePicker.js` file, I can only provide a general suggestion for what the fix might look like:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
start.addEventListener('keydown', handleArrowDown);
=======
if (start && typeof start.addEventListener === 'function') {
  start.addEventListener('keydown', handleArrowDown);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This is a common pattern to fix this type of error - checking if the element exists and has the expected method before calling it.

If you could provide the `DatePicker.js` file, particularly around line 316, I could give you a more precise fix.
