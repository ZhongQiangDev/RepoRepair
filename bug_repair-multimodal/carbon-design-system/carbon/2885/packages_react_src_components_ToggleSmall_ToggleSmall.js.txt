I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that VoiceOver doesn't announce the On/Off labels for the toggle component. According to the issue description, this is because `aria-hidden="true"` was recently added to the toggle component, which prevents screen readers from accessing the label content.

Looking at the code, I can see that the toggle component has an SVG element inside the toggle appearance span, but there's no explicit `aria-hidden="true"` attribute in the code shown. However, the issue mentions that removing this attribute fixes the problem.

The key issue appears to be with how the accessibility information is structured. The component has:
1. An input with `aria-label`
2. A label with a visual appearance
3. An assistive text span that contains the `ariaLabel` value

The problem is likely that screen readers can't properly access the label information.

## Fix

I'll modify the code to ensure the label is properly announced by VoiceOver:

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ToggleSmall/ToggleSmall.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <span className={`${prefix}--toggle__appearance`}>
          <svg
            className={`${prefix}--toggle__check`}
            width="6px"
            height="5px"
            viewBox="0 0 6 5">
            <path d="M2.2403 2.7299L4.9245 0 6 1.1117 2.2384 5 0 2.6863 1.0612 1.511z" />
          </svg>
        </span>
        <span className={`${prefix}--assistive-text`}>{ariaLabel}</span>
=======
        <span className={`${prefix}--toggle__appearance`}>
          <svg
            className={`${prefix}--toggle__check`}
            width="6px"
            height="5px"
            viewBox="0 0 6 5"
            aria-hidden="true">
            <path d="M2.2403 2.7299L4.9245 0 6 1.1117 2.2384 5 0 2.6863 1.0612 1.511z" />
          </svg>
        </span>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix removes the assistive text span and adds `aria-hidden="true"` to the SVG element. This might seem counterintuitive since the issue mentioned removing `aria-hidden`, but the problem is likely that the assistive text was being hidden from screen readers. By removing the separate assistive text span and relying on the `aria-label` attribute on the input element, VoiceOver should properly announce the toggle state.

Let me revise my solution after reconsidering the issue description more carefully.

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/ToggleSmall/ToggleSmall.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <span className={`${prefix}--toggle__appearance`}>
          <svg
            className={`${prefix}--toggle__check`}
            width="6px"
            height="5px"
            viewBox="0 0 6 5">
            <path d="M2.2403 2.7299L4.9245 0 6 1.1117 2.2384 5 0 2.6863 1.0612 1.511z" />
          </svg>
        </span>
        <span className={`${prefix}--assistive-text`}>{ariaLabel}</span>
=======
        <span className={`${prefix}--toggle__appearance`}>
          <svg
            className={`${prefix}--toggle__check`}
            width="6px"
            height="5px"
            viewBox="0 0 6 5">
            <path d="M2.2403 2.7299L4.9245 0 6 1.1117 2.2384 5 0 2.6863 1.0612 1.511z" />
          </svg>
        </span>
        {ariaLabel && <span className={`${prefix}--assistive-text`}>{ariaLabel}</span>}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that the assistive text is present and not hidden from screen readers. The issue mentioned that removing `aria-hidden` fixed the problem, which suggests that something in the component was incorrectly hidden from screen readers.
