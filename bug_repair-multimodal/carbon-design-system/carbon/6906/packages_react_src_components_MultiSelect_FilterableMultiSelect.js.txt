I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue shows a DAP (Deque Accessibility Platform) error with the MultiSelect.Filterable component. Looking at the screenshot, it appears to be an accessibility issue.

The problem is likely related to the `aria-controls` attribute in the input element. The error message in the screenshot indicates that the input has an `aria-controls` attribute that references an element ID that doesn't exist or isn't properly formatted.

Looking at the code, I can see that the input has:
```javascript
aria-controls={`${id}__menu`}
```

But the menu element has:
```javascript
id={`${id}-menu`}
```

There's a mismatch between the ID referenced in `aria-controls` (`${id}__menu`) and the actual ID of the menu element (`${id}-menu`). The input is using double underscores while the menu is using a hyphen.

## Fix

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    <input
                      className={inputClasses}
                      aria-controls={`${id}__menu`}
                      aria-autocomplete="list"
                      ref={(el) => (this.inputNode = el)}
                      {...getInputProps({
                        disabled,
                        id,
                        placeholder,
                        onKeyDown: this.handleOnInputKeyDown,
                      })}
                    />
=======
                    <input
                      className={inputClasses}
                      aria-controls={`${id}-menu`}
                      aria-autocomplete="list"
                      ref={(el) => (this.inputNode = el)}
                      {...getInputProps({
                        disabled,
                        id,
                        placeholder,
                        onKeyDown: this.handleOnInputKeyDown,
                      })}
                    />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that the `aria-controls` attribute in the input element correctly references the ID of the menu element, which is `${id}-menu`. This will resolve the DAP accessibility error by making sure the input properly controls the menu it's associated with.
