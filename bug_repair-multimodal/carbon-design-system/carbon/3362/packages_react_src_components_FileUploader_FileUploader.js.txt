I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is a Digital Accessibility Platform (DAP) violation in the `FileUploaderButton` component. According to the issue description, the problem is that the `<label>` element has a `role` attribute that needs to be removed.

Looking at the code, I can see that in the `render()` method of the `FileUploaderButton` component, the `<label>` element has two role attributes:

1. A hardcoded `role="button"` attribute
2. A dynamic `role={role}` attribute that comes from props

This is causing a DAP violation. The issue specifically mentions to "remove 'role' from the label" to fix it.

## Fix

I'll create a SEARCH/REPLACE edit to remove the duplicate role attribute (the one coming from props) while keeping the hardcoded `role="button"` which is likely needed for proper accessibility.

```javascript
### packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        <label
          role="button"
          tabIndex={tabIndex || 0}
          className={classes}
          onKeyDown={evt => {
            if (evt.which === 13 || evt.which === 32) {
              this.input.click();
            }
          }}
          htmlFor={this.uid}
          role={role}
          {...other}>
=======
        <label
          role="button"
          tabIndex={tabIndex || 0}
          className={classes}
          onKeyDown={evt => {
            if (evt.which === 13 || evt.which === 32) {
              this.input.click();
            }
          }}
          htmlFor={this.uid}
          {...other}>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix removes the `role={role}` attribute from the label element, which will resolve the DAP violation while maintaining the intended functionality. The hardcoded `role="button"` is kept to ensure the label behaves like a button for accessibility purposes.
