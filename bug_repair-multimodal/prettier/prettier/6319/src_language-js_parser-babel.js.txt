I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, the problem is that Prettier only supports the "minimal" proposal for the pipeline operator, but the user wants it to also support the "Smart" and "F#" proposals. The error occurs when trying to use the Smart pipeline operator syntax with `#` in the code.

Looking at the code, I can see that in the `babelOptions` function, there's a configuration for the pipeline operator plugin that only specifies the "minimal" proposal:

```javascript
["pipelineOperator", { proposal: "minimal" }],
```

To fix this issue, we need to update the configuration to support the other proposals as well.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/language-js/parser-babel.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      ["pipelineOperator", { proposal: "minimal" }],
=======
      ["pipelineOperator", { proposal: "smart" }],
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the pipeline operator configuration to use the "smart" proposal, which will allow the syntax shown in the issue example (`5 |> # * 2`). The "smart" proposal is a superset of the "minimal" proposal, so this change will maintain backward compatibility while adding support for the new syntax.

Note: If we wanted to support the F# proposal as well, we would need to add additional configuration or make the parser configurable. However, since the immediate issue is about supporting the Smart proposal (which is what the example code is using), this change addresses the current problem.
