I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, there's a bug in the TypeScript formatting where an empty array `[]` in a generic type is incorrectly formatted with a comma when certain conditions are met (specifically with print-width 120 and identifiers of a certain length).

Looking at the code, the issue is likely in the `printTupleType` function in `src/language-js/print/type-annotation.js`. The function is adding a comma in empty arrays when it shouldn't.

The problem is that the function is adding a comma based on the `shouldPrintComma` option, but it's not checking if the array is empty. It's only checking if there's a rest element.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/language-js/print/type-annotation.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  return group([
    "[",
    indent([softline, printArrayItems(path, options, typesField, print)]),
    ifBreak(shouldPrintComma(options, "all") && !hasRest ? "," : ""),
    printDanglingComments(path, options, /* sameIndent */ true),
    softline,
    "]",
  ]);
=======
  const isEmpty = node[typesField].length === 0;
  return group([
    "[",
    indent([softline, printArrayItems(path, options, typesField, print)]),
    ifBreak(shouldPrintComma(options, "all") && !hasRest && !isEmpty ? "," : ""),
    printDanglingComments(path, options, /* sameIndent */ true),
    softline,
    "]",
  ]);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a check for empty arrays (`isEmpty`) and only adds a trailing comma if the array is not empty, there's no rest element, and the comma option is enabled.
