I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is about inconsistent formatting of comments in `switch` statements. Specifically, when a comment follows a `case:` statement on the same line, it stays on that line, but when a comment follows a `default:` statement, it gets moved to the next line.

Looking at the code, the issue is likely in the `SwitchCase` handling in the `printer-estree.js` file. Let's examine how comments are handled in switch cases.

After reviewing the code, I found that the issue is in how the `default:` case is handled differently from regular `case` statements. The problem is in the `printPathNoParens` function, specifically in the `SwitchCase` case handling.

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### src/language-js/printer-estree.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    case "SwitchCase": {
      if (node.test) {
        parts.push("case ", print("test"), ":");
      } else {
        parts.push("default:");
      }

      const consequent = node.consequent.filter(
        (node) => node.type !== "EmptyStatement"
      );

      if (consequent.length > 0) {
        const cons = printSwitchCaseConsequent(path, options, print);

        parts.push(
          consequent.length === 1 && consequent[0].type === "BlockStatement"
            ? [" ", cons]
            : indent([hardline, cons])
        );
      }

      return parts;
=======
    case "SwitchCase": {
      if (node.test) {
        parts.push("case ", print("test"), ":");
      } else {
        parts.push("default:");
      }

      const consequent = node.consequent.filter(
        (node) => node.type !== "EmptyStatement"
      );

      if (consequent.length > 0) {
        const cons = printSwitchCaseConsequent(path, options, print);

        parts.push(
          consequent.length === 1 && consequent[0].type === "BlockStatement"
            ? [" ", cons]
            : indent([hardline, cons])
        );
      }

      return parts;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After examining the code more carefully, I see that the issue is not directly in the `SwitchCase` handling but likely in how trailing comments are processed. The issue is probably in the `printSwitchCaseConsequent` function which is imported from `./print/statement.js`. Since that file isn't provided in the code segments, I'll need to make an educated guess about the fix.

Let me provide a more targeted fix:

```javascript
### src/language-js/printer-estree.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    case "SwitchCase": {
      if (node.test) {
        parts.push("case ", print("test"), ":");
      } else {
        parts.push("default:");
      }
=======
    case "SwitchCase": {
      if (node.test) {
        parts.push("case ", print("test"), ":");
      } else {
        parts.push("default:", hasComment(node, CommentCheckFlags.Trailing) ? " " : "");
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a space after `default:` when there's a trailing comment, which should keep the comment on the same line, similar to how it works for `case` statements.
