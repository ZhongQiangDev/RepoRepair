I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The problem is that when using the multi-diagram plugin together with the deep linking feature for subprocesses, the deep linking overlay for subprocesses disappears when navigating between diagrams.

Looking at the GIF in the issue, we can see that:
1. The user navigates to a subprocess using deep linking (the overlay appears)
2. Then they navigate to another diagram using the multi-diagram plugin
3. When they return, the deep linking overlay for the subprocess is gone

The issue is likely in the `DrilldownUtil.js` file, specifically in the `getPlaneIdFromShape` function. This function only handles subprocesses but doesn't account for the multi-diagram plugin's "global subprocesses" which are separate diagrams.

## Solution

The problem is that the `getPlaneIdFromShape` function only checks if the element is a subprocess, but it doesn't handle the case when the element is a different type that should also have a plane suffix. We need to modify this function to be more inclusive of other element types that might need plane IDs.

```javascript
### lib/util/DrilldownUtil.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * Get plane ID for a primary shape.
 *
 * @param  {djs.model.Base|ModdleElement} element
 *
 * @returns {String}
 */
export function getPlaneIdFromShape(element) {
  var id = element.id;

  if (is(element, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
    return addPlaneSuffix(id);
  }

  return id;
}
=======
/**
 * Get plane ID for a primary shape.
 *
 * @param  {djs.model.Base|ModdleElement} element
 *
 * @returns {String}
 */
export function getPlaneIdFromShape(element) {
  var id = element.id;

  // Check if the element already has a plane suffix to avoid adding it twice
  if (id.endsWith(planeSuffix)) {
    return id;
  }

  // Add plane suffix for SubProcess elements and any element that might be drillable
  if (is(element, 'bpmn:SubProcess') || element.businessObject?.get('isMultiDiagram')) {
    return addPlaneSuffix(id);
  }

  return id;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change does two important things:

1. It checks if the ID already has a plane suffix to avoid adding it twice
2. It adds support for elements that have the `isMultiDiagram` property set by the multi-diagram plugin

This should allow the deep linking overlay to persist when navigating between diagrams in the multi-diagram plugin, as it will properly maintain the plane IDs for both regular subprocesses and the multi-diagram elements.
