I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when pasting elements with a task in the first position, direct editing is automatically activated for that task. According to the issue description, this happens even though there was a previous fix (issue #1152) that attempted to solve this by selecting all elements after pasting.

Looking at the provided code, I don't see the direct cause of the issue in the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file. The issue is likely related to how elements are handled after pasting. The problem is that when a task element is pasted in the first position, it's being automatically put into direct editing mode.

Since the code for handling the selection after paste isn't shown in the provided file, I need to make an educated guess about what might be causing this issue.

## Proposed Fix

The issue is likely in the code that handles the paste operation and element selection. Based on the issue description, there was a previous attempt to fix this by selecting all elements after pasting, but it's not working correctly when a task is in the first position.

Since I don't see the exact code that's causing the issue in the provided file, I'll suggest a fix that would likely address the problem. The fix would involve ensuring that direct editing is not activated after pasting, especially for task elements.

```javascript
### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElements', function() {
    references = {};
  });
=======
  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElements', function(context) {
    references = {};
    
    // Ensure direct editing is not activated after paste
    if (context.elements && context.elements.length) {
      // By setting a property on the context, we can signal to other components
      // that this paste operation should not trigger direct editing
      context.preventDirectEdit = true;
    }
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a flag to the paste context that can be used by other components to determine whether direct editing should be activated. However, without seeing the code that actually handles the direct editing activation, this is a best guess.

If the above fix doesn't work, we would need to see the code that handles the selection and direct editing activation after paste operations to provide a more targeted fix.
