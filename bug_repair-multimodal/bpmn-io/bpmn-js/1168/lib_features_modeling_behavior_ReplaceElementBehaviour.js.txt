I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The bug occurs when pasting elements with a task in the first position, which automatically activates direct editing for that task. According to the issue description, this happens despite a previous fix (issue #1152) that attempted to solve it by selecting all elements after pasting.

Looking at the provided code, I don't see the paste handling logic in the `ReplaceElementBehaviour.js` file. The issue is likely in the code that handles the paste operation and element selection.

Since the issue mentions that a previous fix attempted to solve this by selecting all elements after pasting, the bug is probably related to how selection and direct editing are triggered after a paste operation.

## Solution

Since the relevant code isn't in the provided file, I'll need to make an educated guess about where the bug might be. The issue is likely in a file that handles clipboard operations or direct editing activation.

The problem seems to be that when pasting elements with a task in the first position, direct editing is automatically activated for that task. To fix this, we need to ensure that direct editing is not triggered after a paste operation.

Without seeing the actual paste handling code, I can suggest a conceptual fix:

1. After pasting, ensure that direct editing is not automatically activated
2. Make sure the selection behavior works correctly (selecting all pasted elements)

Since I don't have the actual file where the bug is located, I can't provide a specific search/replace edit. However, if you can provide the clipboard/paste handling code or the direct editing activation code, I can give a more specific solution.
