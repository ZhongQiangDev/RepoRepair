I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

The issue is about implementing the ability to toggle `isCollection = true` on data objects, inputs, and outputs in BPMN diagrams. This is a feature request to support the BPMN 2.0 specification's "isCollection" marker.

Looking at the provided code, I don't see any implementation for handling the `isCollection` property. The `BpmnFactory.js` file is responsible for creating BPMN elements, but it doesn't have specific logic for setting the `isCollection` property on data objects.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `BpmnFactory.js` file to handle the `isCollection` property when creating data objects. Here's my proposed solution:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnFactory.prototype.create = function(type, attrs) {
  var element = this._model.create(type, attrs || {});

  this._ensureId(element);

  return element;
};
=======
BpmnFactory.prototype.create = function(type, attrs) {
  var element = this._model.create(type, attrs || {});

  this._ensureId(element);

  // Handle isCollection property for data objects, data inputs, and data outputs
  if (isAny(element, [
    'bpmn:DataObject',
    'bpmn:DataInput',
    'bpmn:DataOutput'
  ]) && attrs && attrs.isCollection) {
    element.isCollection = attrs.isCollection;
  }

  return element;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a check for data objects, data inputs, and data outputs, and sets the `isCollection` property if it's provided in the attributes. This allows the property to be toggled on these elements, which is what the issue is requesting.
