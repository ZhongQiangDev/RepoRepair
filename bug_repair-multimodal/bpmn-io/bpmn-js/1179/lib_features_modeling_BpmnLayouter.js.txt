I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue shows that when dropping an element onto a sequence flow, the layout breaks. The new incoming sequence flow is always docked at the top left corner of the element instead of properly connecting to it.

Looking at the code, the problem appears to be in the `getConnectionDocking` function. When a new element is dropped onto a sequence flow, the function should determine the proper docking point, but it's not handling this case correctly.

The current implementation:
```javascript
function getConnectionDocking(point, shape) {
  return point ? (point.original || point) : getMid(shape);
}
```

This function returns either the original point (if it exists) or the middle of the shape. However, when dropping an element onto a sequence flow, the docking point needs to be properly calculated based on the shape's geometry, not just defaulting to the top-left corner.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function getConnectionDocking(point, shape) {
  return point ? (point.original || point) : getMid(shape);
}
=======
function getConnectionDocking(point, shape) {
  return point ? (point.original || point) : getMid(shape);
}
=======
function getConnectionDocking(point, shape) {
  if (point) {
    return point.original || point;
  }
  
  return getMid(shape);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the function looks correct already. Let me look more carefully at the issue.

After further analysis, I believe the problem is that when a new element is dropped onto a sequence flow, the waypoints aren't being properly calculated. The issue might be in how the connection start and end points are determined.

Let's modify the layoutConnection function to ensure proper docking points:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (!start) {
    start = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[0], source);
  }

  if (!end) {
    end = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[waypoints.length - 1], target);
  }
=======
  if (!start) {
    start = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[0], source);
  }

  if (!end) {
    end = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[waypoints.length - 1], target);
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The code looks correct here too. Let me look at the entire function more carefully.

After reviewing the code more thoroughly, I believe the issue is that when a new element is dropped onto a sequence flow, the original waypoints are being used without proper adjustment. Let's modify the layoutConnection function to ensure proper handling of this case:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnLayouter.prototype.layoutConnection = function(connection, hints) {
  hints = hints || {};

  var source = hints.source || connection.source,
      target = hints.target || connection.target,
      waypoints = connection.waypoints,
      start = hints.connectionStart,
      end = hints.connectionEnd;

  var manhattanOptions,
      updatedWaypoints;

  if (!start) {
    start = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[0], source);
  }

  if (!end) {
    end = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[waypoints.length - 1], target);
  }
=======
BpmnLayouter.prototype.layoutConnection = function(connection, hints) {
  hints = hints || {};

  var source = hints.source || connection.source,
      target = hints.target || connection.target,
      waypoints = connection.waypoints,
      start = hints.connectionStart,
      end = hints.connectionEnd;

  var manhattanOptions,
      updatedWaypoints;

  // When a connection is being created or reconnected, ensure we use proper docking points
  if (hints.connectionStart || hints.connectionEnd) {
    start = hints.connectionStart || getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[0], source);
    end = hints.connectionEnd || getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[waypoints.length - 1], target);
  } else {
    if (!start) {
      start = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[0], source);
    }

    if (!end) {
      end = getConnectionDocking(waypoints && waypoints[waypoints.length - 1], target);
    }
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

After further analysis, I believe the issue is related to how the connection docking points are determined when an element is dropped onto a sequence flow. Let's try a different approach:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function getConnectionDocking(point, shape) {
  return point ? (point.original || point) : getMid(shape);
}
=======
function getConnectionDocking(point, shape) {
  // If we have a point, use it or its original
  if (point) {
    return point.original || point;
  }
  
  // Otherwise calculate the center of the shape
  return getMid(shape);
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
