I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the vertical pool/lane label rendering problem.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about vertical pools not being rendered correctly. When a pool is marked as vertical (`isHorizontal="false"` in the BPMN XML), the labels are still positioned as if the pool were horizontal, resulting in misplaced labels.

Looking at the code, I can see that the `BpmnImporter` class handles importing BPMN elements, including their labels. However, it doesn't account for the orientation of pools when positioning labels.

The bug is in the `addLabel` method of `BpmnImporter.js`. When getting the external label bounds, it doesn't consider whether the element is a vertical pool or lane.

## Fix

We need to modify the `addLabel` method to check if the element is a pool or lane and if it's vertical (not horizontal), and adjust the label positioning accordingly.

```javascript
### lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnImporter.prototype.addLabel = function(semantic, di, element) {
  var bounds,
      text,
      label;

  bounds = getExternalLabelBounds(di, element);

  text = getLabel(element);

  if (text) {

    // get corrected bounds from actual layouted text
    bounds = this._textRenderer.getExternalLabelBounds(bounds, text);
  }

  label = this._elementFactory.createLabel(elementData(semantic, di, {
    id: semantic.id + '_label',
    labelTarget: element,
    type: 'label',
    hidden: element.hidden || !getLabel(element),
    x: Math.round(bounds.x),
    y: Math.round(bounds.y),
    width: Math.round(bounds.width),
    height: Math.round(bounds.height)
  }));

  return this._canvas.addShape(label, element.parent);
};

  if (text) {

    // get corrected bounds from actual layouted text
    bounds = this._textRenderer.getExternalLabelBounds(bounds, text);
  }

  // Check if the element is a vertical pool or lane
  var isVertical = false;
  if ((is(semantic, 'bpmn:Participant') || is(semantic, 'bpmn:Lane')) && di && di.isHorizontal === false) {
    isVertical = true;
  }

  label = this._elementFactory.createLabel(elementData(semantic, di, {
    id: semantic.id + '_label',
    labelTarget: element,
    type: 'label',
    hidden: element.hidden || !getLabel(element),
    x: Math.round(bounds.x),
    y: Math.round(bounds.y),
    width: Math.round(bounds.width),
    height: Math.round(bounds.height),
    isVertical: isVertical
  }));

  return this._canvas.addShape(label, element.parent);
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a check for vertical pools and lanes by examining the `isHorizontal` property of the DI element. If the element is a participant or lane and `isHorizontal` is explicitly set to `false`, we mark the label as vertical by adding an `isVertical` property to the label data.

Note that this is only part of the solution. The rendering code that uses this information would also need to be updated to properly position the label based on the `isVertical` flag. However, that code is not included in the provided file segments, so I'm focusing on the part we can see.
