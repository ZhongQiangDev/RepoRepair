I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about connecting message flows to pool boundaries. When a pool has had more than one lane in the past (even if it now has only one lane), it becomes difficult to connect a message flow to the pool's body - it only works when connecting to the pool's header.

Looking at the provided code, the issue is likely in the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file. However, this file doesn't directly handle the connection of message flows to pools. The issue is probably related to how the system determines valid connection points after a lane has been added and then removed.

The problem is that the code doesn't properly check if a point is inside a shape's bounds. The function `isPointInsideBBox` is referenced but not defined in the provided code. This function is crucial for determining if a connection point is valid.

## Fix

I need to add the missing `isPointInsideBBox` function to properly check if a point is inside a shape's bounding box. This function should check if a point is within the boundaries of a shape.

      }

      // if first waypointAfter is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point
      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsAfter[0])) {
        waypointsAfter.unshift(copy(dockingPoint));
      }

      }

      // if first waypointAfter is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point
      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsAfter[0])) {
        waypointsAfter.unshift(copy(dockingPoint));
      }

// helpers //////////////////////

function isPointInsideBBox(shape, point) {
  var bbox = asTRBL(shape);
  
  return point.x >= bbox.left &&
         point.x <= bbox.right &&
         point.y >= bbox.top &&
         point.y <= bbox.bottom;
}

function copy(obj) {
  return assign({}, obj);
}

function getMid(shape) {
  return {
    x: shape.x + shape.width / 2,
    y: shape.y + shape.height / 2
  };
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix adds:
1. Import for `asTRBL` from LayoutUtil to help with bounding box calculations
2. Implementation of the missing `isPointInsideBBox` function that checks if a point is inside a shape's bounding box
3. Implementation of the missing `copy` and `getMid` helper functions that were referenced but not defined

These changes should fix the issue by properly determining when a point is inside a shape's bounds, which is crucial for connecting message flows to pool boundaries, especially after lane modifications.
