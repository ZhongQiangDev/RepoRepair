I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The problem is that with the introduction of grid snapping, it's no longer easy to connect tasks center-to-center. The issue shows that in the old behavior, connecting two tasks center-to-center worked fine, but with the new behavior, it's difficult to achieve this connection.

Looking at the `BpmnGridSnapping.js` file, I can see that it's setting up grid snapping for certain BPMN elements (Participant, SubProcess, TextAnnotation) to snap from their top-left corner. However, the issue is that this doesn't include regular tasks, which should also have a snapping behavior defined to allow for center-to-center connections.

## Fix

The solution is to extend the list of elements that have a specific snapping behavior to include Task elements. However, instead of making tasks snap from their top-left corner, we should make them snap from their center to facilitate center-to-center connections.

```javascript
### lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import { isAny } from '../modeling/util/ModelingUtil';

export default function BpmnGridSnapping(eventBus) {
  eventBus.on([
    'create.init',
    'shape.move.init'
  ], function(event) {
    var context = event.context,
        shape = event.shape;

    if (isAny(shape, [
      'bpmn:Participant',
      'bpmn:SubProcess',
      'bpmn:TextAnnotation'
    ])) {
      if (!context.gridSnappingContext) {
        context.gridSnappingContext = {};
      }

      context.gridSnappingContext.snapLocation = 'top-left';
    }
  });
}

import { isAny } from '../modeling/util/ModelingUtil';

export default function BpmnGridSnapping(eventBus) {
  eventBus.on([
    'create.init',
    'shape.move.init'
  ], function(event) {
    var context = event.context,
        shape = event.shape;

    if (!context.gridSnappingContext) {
      context.gridSnappingContext = {};
    }

    if (isAny(shape, [
      'bpmn:Participant',
      'bpmn:SubProcess',
      'bpmn:TextAnnotation'
    ])) {
      context.gridSnappingContext.snapLocation = 'top-left';
    } else if (isAny(shape, [
      'bpmn:Task',
      'bpmn:Activity'
    ])) {
      context.gridSnappingContext.snapLocation = 'center';
    }
  });
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Moves the initialization of `gridSnappingContext` outside the first condition so it's always created
2. Adds a new condition to check if the shape is a Task or Activity
3. Sets the `snapLocation` to 'center' for Tasks and Activities, which will facilitate center-to-center connections

This should restore the ability to easily connect tasks center-to-center while maintaining the top-left snapping for larger elements like Participants and SubProcesses.
