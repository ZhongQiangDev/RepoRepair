I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about how colors are applied to external labels. According to the issue:
1. When setting the color of elements with external labels, the external label is set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color
2. This is inconsistent with embedded labels, which use the stroke color
3. The fill color is too light, causing UX concerns

However, I don't see the code that handles the color setting in the provided file. The `LabelUtil.js` file only contains utility functions for working with labels, but not the actual color setting logic.

Since the issue mentions `modeling.setColor` API, we need to find where this is implemented. The bug is likely in the code that determines which color (fill or stroke) to apply to external labels.

## Missing Information

I don't see the actual implementation of the `setColor` function in the provided code. To properly fix this issue, I would need to see:

1. The implementation of the `modeling.setColor` API
2. The code that determines which color to apply to labels

Without seeing the actual code that handles color setting, I can't provide a specific fix. However, I can make an educated guess based on the issue description.

The issue likely exists in a file that handles the color setting logic, where it's using the fill color for external labels instead of the stroke color. The fix would involve modifying that logic to use the stroke color for external labels, just like it does for embedded labels.

If you can provide the implementation of the `modeling.setColor` API or the file that handles color setting for labels, I can provide a more specific fix.
