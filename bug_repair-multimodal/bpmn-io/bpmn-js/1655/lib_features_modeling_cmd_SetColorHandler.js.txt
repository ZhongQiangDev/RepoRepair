I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, the problem is that when setting the color of elements with external labels, the external label is set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color. This is happening in the `SetColorHandler.prototype.postExecute` method where the label color is being set to `di['background-color']` instead of `di['border-color']`.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/SetColorHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      self._commandStack.execute('element.updateModdleProperties', {
        element: element,
        moddleElement: getDi(element).label,
        properties: {
          color: di['background-color']
        }
      });
=======
      self._commandStack.execute('element.updateModdleProperties', {
        element: element,
        moddleElement: getDi(element).label,
        properties: {
          color: di['border-color']
        }
      });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that external labels use the stroke color (border-color) instead of the fill color (background-color), which matches the expected behavior described in the issue and makes it consistent with embedded labels.
