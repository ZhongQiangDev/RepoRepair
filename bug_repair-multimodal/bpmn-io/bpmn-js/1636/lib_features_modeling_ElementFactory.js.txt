I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about morphing a call activity to an expanded subprocess. Currently, when a call activity is morphed into an expanded subprocess, it doesn't automatically add a start event, unlike when morphing from a task to an expanded subprocess.

Looking at the code, the issue is likely in the `ElementFactory.js` file. The problem is that when morphing a call activity to a subprocess, it doesn't automatically add a start event inside the subprocess.

The fix would need to be implemented in a different file that handles the morphing behavior, as the provided file doesn't contain the specific morphing logic. However, we can see that the `ElementFactory.js` file defines the default sizes and properties for different BPMN elements.

Since the complete morphing logic isn't provided in the shared code, I'll need to make an educated guess about where the fix should be applied. Based on the issue description and screenshots, I believe we need to modify the behavior when morphing from a call activity to an expanded subprocess to match the behavior when morphing from a task to an expanded subprocess.

## Fix

Since the specific morphing code isn't provided, I'll recommend a conceptual fix that would need to be implemented in the appropriate file:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnReplaceHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// This is a conceptual search - the actual code might differ
// We need to find the code that handles morphing a call activity to a subprocess
// and ensure it adds a start event, similar to how it's done for tasks
=======
// The fix would involve ensuring that when morphing from a call activity to an expanded subprocess,
// a start event is automatically added, similar to how it's done when morphing from a task.
// This would likely involve modifying the replace handler to detect when a call activity
// is being replaced with an expanded subprocess, and then adding a start event.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Without seeing the actual morphing code, I can't provide a precise fix. However, the issue is clear: when morphing a call activity to an expanded subprocess, a start event should be automatically added, just like when morphing from a task.

The fix would likely involve modifying the code that handles the morphing operation to ensure that when a call activity is morphed into an expanded subprocess, it adds a start event inside the subprocess.

If you could provide the code for the morphing/replacement functionality (likely in files like `BpmnReplace.js`, `BpmnReplaceHandler.js`, or similar), I could provide a more specific fix.
