I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about morphing behavior when converting a call activity to an expanded subprocess. Currently, when a call activity is morphed into an expanded subprocess, it doesn't automatically add a start event, unlike when morphing from a task to an expanded subprocess.

Looking at the provided code, I don't see the specific morphing logic in the `BpmnUpdater.js` file. The issue is likely in a different file that handles the morphing behavior. However, based on the issue description, we need to ensure that when morphing from a call activity to an expanded subprocess, a start event is added automatically.

Since the complete code isn't provided, I'll need to make an educated guess about where this functionality might be implemented. The most likely place would be in a file that handles morphing operations, possibly named something like `BpmnMorphing.js` or similar.

## Solution Approach

Without seeing the exact morphing code, I'll provide a general approach to fix this issue:

1. Find the code that handles morphing from a task to an expanded subprocess (which correctly adds a start event)
2. Ensure the same logic is applied when morphing from a call activity to an expanded subprocess

Let me search for this code in the repository. Since I don't have direct access to the repository, I'll provide a generic solution based on the likely structure of the code.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnMorphing.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
function replaceElement(element, target, hints) {

  hints = hints || {};

  var context = {
    hints: hints,
    oldElement: element,
    newElement: target
  };

  var newElement = this._modeling.replaceShape(element, target, hints);

  if (hints.select !== false) {
    this._selection.select(newElement);
  }

  var expansionAware = isExpanded(newElement) !== isExpanded(element);

  // morph task to expanded subprocess
  if (expansionAware && isExpanded(newElement) && is(newElement, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
    this._modeling.toggleCollapse(newElement);

    // add start event inside subprocess
    this._eventBus.fire('autoPlace', {
      source: newElement
    });
  }

  return newElement;
}
=======
function replaceElement(element, target, hints) {

  hints = hints || {};

  var context = {
    hints: hints,
    oldElement: element,
    newElement: target
  };

  var newElement = this._modeling.replaceShape(element, target, hints);

  if (hints.select !== false) {
    this._selection.select(newElement);
  }

  var expansionAware = isExpanded(newElement) !== isExpanded(element);

  // morph task or call activity to expanded subprocess
  if (expansionAware && isExpanded(newElement) && is(newElement, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
    this._modeling.toggleCollapse(newElement);

    // add start event inside subprocess
    this._eventBus.fire('autoPlace', {
      source: newElement
    });
  }

  return newElement;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Alternatively, if the issue is in a different file structure, the solution might look like this:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/MorphShapeHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
MorphShapeHandler.prototype.postExecute = function(context) {
  var oldElement = context.oldElement,
      newElement = context.newElement;

  var expansionAware = isExpanded(newElement) !== isExpanded(oldElement);

  // morph task to expanded subprocess
  if (expansionAware && isExpanded(newElement) && is(newElement, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
    this._modeling.toggleCollapse(newElement);

    // add start event inside subprocess
    this._eventBus.fire('autoPlace', {
      source: newElement
    });
  }
};
=======
MorphShapeHandler.prototype.postExecute = function(context) {
  var oldElement = context.oldElement,
      newElement = context.newElement;

  var expansionAware = isExpanded(newElement) !== isExpanded(oldElement);

  // morph task or call activity to expanded subprocess
  if (expansionAware && isExpanded(newElement) && is(newElement, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
    this._modeling.toggleCollapse(newElement);

    // add start event inside subprocess
    this._eventBus.fire('autoPlace', {
      source: newElement
    });
  }
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The key change in both examples is modifying the comment to explicitly include call activities, which makes it clear that the same behavior should apply to both tasks and call activities when morphing to expanded subprocesses. The actual code logic might not need to change if the issue is just that the condition isn't being triggered for call activities.

Without seeing the exact code that handles this morphing behavior, this is my best guess at the solution. The actual fix might require more specific changes depending on how the morphing logic is implemented in the codebase.
