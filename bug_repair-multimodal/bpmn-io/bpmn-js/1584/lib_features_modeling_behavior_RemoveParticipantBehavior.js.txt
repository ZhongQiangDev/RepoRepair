I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue has two related problems:
1. When redoing the addition of the first participant, the process ID changes unexpectedly
2. When deleting the last participant (not via undo), the process ID also changes

Looking at the code in `RemoveParticipantBehavior.js`, I can see that when the last participant is removed, the `modeling.makeProcess()` function is called. This function likely creates a new process with a new ID, which explains why the process ID changes when deleting the last participant.

The issue with redo is likely because the undo/redo system doesn't properly preserve the original process ID when redoing the addition of a participant.

## Fix

The solution is to modify the `RemoveParticipantBehavior.js` file to preserve the process ID when removing the last participant. We need to pass the original process ID to the `makeProcess()` function.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/RemoveParticipantBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  this.postExecute('shape.delete', function(context) {

    var collaborationRoot = context.collaborationRoot;

    if (collaborationRoot && !collaborationRoot.businessObject.participants.length) {

      // replace empty collaboration with process diagram
      modeling.makeProcess();
    }
  }, true);
=======
  this.postExecute('shape.delete', function(context) {

    var collaborationRoot = context.collaborationRoot;

    if (collaborationRoot && !collaborationRoot.businessObject.participants.length) {
      // get the original process ID before replacing
      var processId = collaborationRoot.businessObject.id;

      // replace empty collaboration with process diagram, preserving the ID
      modeling.makeProcess({ processId: processId });
    }
  }, true);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when the last participant is removed, the original process ID is preserved and passed to the `makeProcess()` function. This should fix both issues:

1. When redoing the addition of the first participant, the process ID will remain the same
2. When deleting the last participant, the process ID will also remain the same

The fix assumes that the `makeProcess()` function can accept an options object with a `processId` property. If the actual implementation is different, the fix might need to be adjusted accordingly.
