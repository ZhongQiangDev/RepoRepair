I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue has two related problems:

1. When adding a participant to a model, undoing, and then redoing, the process ID changes unexpectedly.
2. When copying and pasting a pool, the process ID is duplicated, causing XML validation issues.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file. When copying a participant with a process reference, the code creates a new process but doesn't ensure it has a unique ID. This is happening in the `moddleCopy.canCopyProperty` event handler.

The fix needs to ensure that when copying a process (either through redo or copy-paste), a new unique ID is generated for the process.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  eventBus.on('moddleCopy.canCopyProperty', function(context) {
    var parent = context.parent,
        property = context.property,
        propertyName = context.propertyName,
        bpmnProcess;

    if (
      propertyName === 'processRef' &&
      is(parent, 'bpmn:Participant') &&
      is(property, 'bpmn:Process')
    ) {
      bpmnProcess = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:Process');

      // return copy of process
      return moddleCopy.copyElement(property, bpmnProcess);
    }
  });
=======
  eventBus.on('moddleCopy.canCopyProperty', function(context) {
    var parent = context.parent,
        property = context.property,
        propertyName = context.propertyName,
        bpmnProcess;

    if (
      propertyName === 'processRef' &&
      is(parent, 'bpmn:Participant') &&
      is(property, 'bpmn:Process')
    ) {
      bpmnProcess = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:Process');
      
      // Ensure the new process has a unique ID
      bpmnProcess.id = bpmnFactory.createId();
      
      // return copy of process
      return moddleCopy.copyElement(property, bpmnProcess);
    }
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when a process is copied (either through redo or copy-paste), it gets a new unique ID generated by the bpmnFactory. This prevents duplicate IDs when copying pools and ensures consistent behavior when redoing the addition of a participant.

The root cause of both issues was that the process ID wasn't being explicitly regenerated during the copy operation, leading to inconsistent behavior and duplicate IDs.
