I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that the space tool is allowing empty pools to be resized vertically, which shouldn't happen according to the expected behavior. Empty pools should maintain a fixed height.

Looking at the code, the `BpmnSpaceTool` extends the base `SpaceTool` and currently only filters out text annotations from being resized. We need to also filter out empty pools from the resizing shapes.

In BPMN, an empty pool is a participant without any child lanes or elements. We need to modify the `calculateAdjustments` method to exclude empty pools from vertical resizing.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/space-tool/BpmnSpaceTool.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnSpaceTool.prototype.calculateAdjustments = function(elements, axis, delta, start) {
  var adjustments = SpaceTool.prototype.calculateAdjustments.call(this, elements, axis, delta, start);

  // do not resize text annotations
  adjustments.resizingShapes = adjustments.resizingShapes.filter(function(shape) {
    return !is(shape, 'bpmn:TextAnnotation');
  });

  return adjustments;
};
=======
BpmnSpaceTool.prototype.calculateAdjustments = function(elements, axis, delta, start) {
  var adjustments = SpaceTool.prototype.calculateAdjustments.call(this, elements, axis, delta, start);

  // do not resize text annotations and empty pools vertically
  adjustments.resizingShapes = adjustments.resizingShapes.filter(function(shape) {
    // don't resize text annotations
    if (is(shape, 'bpmn:TextAnnotation')) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // don't resize empty pools vertically
    if (is(shape, 'bpmn:Participant') && 
        (!shape.children || shape.children.length === 0) && 
        axis === 'y') {
      return false;
    }
    
    return true;
  });

  return adjustments;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the `calculateAdjustments` method to filter out empty pools from vertical resizing. It checks if:
1. The shape is a BPMN Participant
2. The participant has no children (empty pool)
3. The resize operation is happening on the y-axis (vertical)

If all these conditions are met, the shape is excluded from the resizing shapes, which will prevent empty pools from being resized vertically while still allowing horizontal resizing.
