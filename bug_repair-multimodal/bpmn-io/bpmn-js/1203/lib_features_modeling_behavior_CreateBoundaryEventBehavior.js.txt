I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, it loses its properties (like Async Continuations and Job Configurations). This happens because in the `CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js` file, when an Intermediate Event is attached to a shape, it's completely replaced with a new Boundary Event without preserving the original event's properties.

Looking at the code, in the `preExecute` handler for 'shape.create', a new business object is created from scratch using `bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:BoundaryEvent', attrs)` without copying over any properties from the original event.

## Fix

We need to modify the `CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js` file to preserve the properties of the original event when converting it to a Boundary Event. Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (host && is(shape, 'bpmn:IntermediateThrowEvent')) {
      attrs.attachedToRef = host.businessObject;

      businessObject = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:BoundaryEvent', attrs);

      boundaryEvent = {
        type: 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent',
        businessObject: businessObject
      };

      context.shape = elementFactory.createShape(boundaryEvent);
    }
=======
    if (host && is(shape, 'bpmn:IntermediateThrowEvent')) {
      attrs.attachedToRef = host.businessObject;
      
      // Copy properties from the original business object
      var originalBusinessObject = shape.businessObject;
      
      // Create new business object with the same properties
      businessObject = bpmnFactory.create('bpmn:BoundaryEvent', attrs);
      
      // Copy over the extensionElements if they exist
      if (originalBusinessObject.extensionElements) {
        businessObject.extensionElements = originalBusinessObject.extensionElements;
      }
      
      // Copy over any other relevant properties
      if (originalBusinessObject.eventDefinitions) {
        businessObject.eventDefinitions = originalBusinessObject.eventDefinitions;
      }
      
      boundaryEvent = {
        type: 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent',
        businessObject: businessObject
      };

      context.shape = elementFactory.createShape(boundaryEvent);
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix preserves the `extensionElements` (which typically contain Async Continuations and Job Configurations) and `eventDefinitions` from the original Intermediate Event when converting it to a Boundary Event. These are the key properties that need to be maintained during the conversion process.
