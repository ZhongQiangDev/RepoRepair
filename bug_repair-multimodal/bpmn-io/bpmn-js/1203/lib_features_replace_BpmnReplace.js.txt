I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, it loses its properties (specifically Async Continuations and Job Configurations fields). 

Looking at the code, the problem appears to be in the `replaceElement` function in `BpmnReplace.js`. When an element is converted from an Intermediate Event to a Boundary Event, the function doesn't properly copy all the necessary properties.

The issue occurs specifically when:
1. A non-boundary event is being converted to a boundary event
2. The properties that should be preserved (like async continuations) aren't being copied

The problem is in the conditional logic that handles boundary events. When a non-boundary event is converted to a boundary event, it sets the host property but doesn't ensure all the relevant properties are copied.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (
      target.host &&
      !is(oldBusinessObject, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent') &&
      is(newBusinessObject, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent')
    ) {
      newElement.host = target.host;
    }
=======
    if (
      target.host &&
      !is(oldBusinessObject, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent') &&
      is(newBusinessObject, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent')
    ) {
      newElement.host = target.host;
      
      // When converting to a boundary event, ensure we copy all properties
      // including async continuations and job configurations
      newBusinessObject = moddleCopy.copyElement(
        oldBusinessObject,
        newBusinessObject,
        properties
      );
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, I see a problem with my fix. The `moddleCopy.copyElement` is already called earlier in the function. The issue is that when converting to a boundary event, some properties might be filtered out by the `properties` array. Let me revise the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    var properties = filter(copyProps, function(propertyName) {

      // copying event definitions, unless we replace
      if (propertyName === 'eventDefinitions') {
        return hasEventDefinition(element, target.eventDefinitionType);
      }

      // retain loop characteristics if the target element
      // is not an event sub process
      if (propertyName === 'loopCharacteristics') {
        return !isEventSubProcess(newBusinessObject);
      }

      // so the applied properties from 'target' don't get lost
      if (newBusinessObject.hasOwnProperty(propertyName)) {
        return false;
      }

      if (propertyName === 'processRef' && target.isExpanded === false) {
        return false;
      }

      if (propertyName === 'triggeredByEvent') {
        return false;
      }

      return true;
    });
=======
    var properties = filter(copyProps, function(propertyName) {

      // copying event definitions, unless we replace
      if (propertyName === 'eventDefinitions') {
        return hasEventDefinition(element, target.eventDefinitionType);
      }

      // retain loop characteristics if the target element
      // is not an event sub process
      if (propertyName === 'loopCharacteristics') {
        return !isEventSubProcess(newBusinessObject);
      }

      // so the applied properties from 'target' don't get lost
      if (newBusinessObject.hasOwnProperty(propertyName)) {
        return false;
      }

      if (propertyName === 'processRef' && target.isExpanded === false) {
        return false;
      }

      if (propertyName === 'triggeredByEvent') {
        return false;
      }

      // Always preserve async continuations and job configurations
      // when converting between event types
      if (propertyName === 'asyncBefore' || 
          propertyName === 'asyncAfter' || 
          propertyName === 'jobPriority' ||
          propertyName.startsWith('camunda:') || 
          propertyName.startsWith('flowable:')) {
        return true;
      }

      return true;
    });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when filtering properties to copy, we always include the async continuations and job configurations properties, which are typically prefixed with vendor-specific namespaces like 'camunda:' or 'flowable:'. This should preserve these properties when copying an Intermediate Event and pasting it as a Boundary Event.
