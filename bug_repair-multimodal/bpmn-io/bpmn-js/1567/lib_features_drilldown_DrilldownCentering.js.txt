I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue occurs when trying to drill out (navigate back up) after changing the root element. The error message indicates that `rootElement` is required in the `Canvas.setRootElement` method, which is being called from `DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js`.

Looking at the provided code in `DrilldownCentering.js`, I notice a problem in the `positionMap` implementation. The error occurs when trying to remove an element from the map using `positionMap.remove(event.element)`, but the standard JavaScript Map API uses `delete` method, not `remove`. This is causing the map to not properly clear entries when roots are removed.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  eventBus.on('root.remove', function(event) {
    positionMap.remove(event.element);
  });
=======
  eventBus.on('root.remove', function(event) {
    positionMap.delete(event.element);
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix changes the incorrect `positionMap.remove()` call to the correct `positionMap.delete()` method, which is the standard way to remove entries from a JavaScript Map. This ensures that when a root element is removed, its entry in the position map is properly deleted, preventing issues when drilling out of a subprocess.
