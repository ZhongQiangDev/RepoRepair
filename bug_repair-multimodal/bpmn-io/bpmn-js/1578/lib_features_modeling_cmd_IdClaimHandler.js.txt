I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue occurs when copying a Pool element in a BPMN diagram. When a Pool is copied and pasted, it retains the same ID as the original Pool, which causes problems during export/import. The XML snippet in the issue shows two processes with the same ID (`Process_17iojvx`), which is invalid.

The problem is in the ID handling when elements are copied. The `IdClaimHandler` is responsible for claiming and unclaiming IDs in the moddle, but it doesn't appear to be generating new IDs for copied elements.

## Solution

The issue is not directly in the `IdClaimHandler.js` file shown, but rather in how copying elements works. When a Pool is copied, a new unique ID should be generated for the copied element.

Since we don't have access to the copying logic, we need to ensure that the ID claiming mechanism properly handles duplicate IDs. Let's modify the `IdClaimHandler` to check if an ID is already claimed before trying to claim it, and generate a new ID if needed.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/IdClaimHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
IdClaimHandler.prototype.execute = function(context) {
  var ids = this._moddle.ids,
      id = context.id,
      element = context.element,
      claiming = context.claiming;

  if (claiming) {
    ids.claim(id, element);
  } else {
    ids.unclaim(id);
  }
};
=======
IdClaimHandler.prototype.execute = function(context) {
  var ids = this._moddle.ids,
      id = context.id,
      element = context.element,
      claiming = context.claiming;

  if (claiming) {
    // Check if ID is already claimed
    if (ids.assigned(id) && ids.get(id) !== element) {
      // Generate a new unique ID if this one is already taken
      var newId = ids.nextPrefixed(id + '_', id);
      context.id = newId;
      ids.claim(newId, element);
      
      // Update the element's ID if it has an 'id' property
      if (element.id) {
        element.id = newId;
      }
    } else {
      ids.claim(id, element);
    }
  } else {
    ids.unclaim(id);
  }
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This modification checks if the ID is already assigned to a different element before claiming it. If it is, it generates a new unique ID with the original ID as a prefix, updates the context with the new ID, and claims that instead. It also updates the element's ID property if it exists.

Note: This solution assumes that the `ids` object has methods like `assigned()`, `get()`, and `nextPrefixed()`. If these methods don't exist, additional changes would be needed to the moddle IDs implementation.
