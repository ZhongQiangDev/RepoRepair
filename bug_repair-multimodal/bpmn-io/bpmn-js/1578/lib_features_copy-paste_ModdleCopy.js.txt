I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about duplicate Pool IDs when copying and pasting a Pool with a Task inside. The error occurs during export/import because the copied Pool has the same ID as the original Pool, as shown in the XML snippet:

```xml
<bpmn:process id="Process_17iojvx" isExecutable="false">
    <bpmn:task id="Activity_0mkgwx2" />
  </bpmn:process>
  <bpmn:process id="Process_17iojvx" isExecutable="false">
    <bpmn:task id="Activity_1xz8h8p" />
</bpmn:process>
```

Both processes have the same ID: `Process_17iojvx`.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `_copyId` method of the `ModdleCopy` class. When copying an element, the method checks if the ID is already assigned, but if it is, it simply returns undefined instead of generating a new unique ID. This causes the copied element to have no ID, which later defaults to the same ID as the original element.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
ModdleCopy.prototype._copyId = function(id, element) {

  // disallow if already taken
  if (this._moddle.ids.assigned(id)) {
    return;
  } else {

    this._moddle.ids.claim(id, element);
    return id;
  }
};
=======
ModdleCopy.prototype._copyId = function(id, element) {

  // disallow if already taken
  if (this._moddle.ids.assigned(id)) {
    // generate a new unique id instead of returning undefined
    id = this._bpmnFactory._model.ids.nextPrefixed(id + '_', element);
  }

  this._moddle.ids.claim(id, element);
  return id;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the `_copyId` method to generate a new unique ID when the original ID is already taken, instead of returning undefined. The new ID is created by appending an underscore and a unique number to the original ID. This ensures that copied elements always have unique IDs, preventing the issue with duplicate Pool IDs.
