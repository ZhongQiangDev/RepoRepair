I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about an Ad Hoc Collapsed Subprocess getting weird dimensions when:
1. A subprocess with a child element is created and expanded
2. The subprocess is collapsed
3. The subprocess is converted to an Ad Hoc subprocess

From the GIF in the issue, it appears that the subprocess is getting resized incorrectly when it's converted to an Ad Hoc subprocess. This suggests there might be a problem with how the dimensions are handled during this transformation.

Looking at the provided code, we're seeing the `ResizeLaneHandler.js` file, which handles resizing of lanes. While this file doesn't directly handle Ad Hoc subprocesses, the issue might be related to how space is calculated and adjusted when elements are resized.

The bug is likely in the `resizeSpace` method, specifically in how it calculates space adjustments. The issue shows that when converting to an Ad Hoc subprocess, the dimensions change unexpectedly, which could be due to incorrect space calculations.

## Fix

The problem appears to be in the `resizeSpace` method where the `spacePos` for horizontal resizing is calculated with a hardcoded value of `100` for the left direction, which seems inconsistent with the vertical resizing logic that uses `10` for both directions.

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    change = trblDiff.right || trblDiff.left;
    spacePos = shape.x + (trblDiff.right ? shape.width : 0) + (trblDiff.right ? -10 : 100);
    direction = trblDiff.right ? 'e' : 'w';
=======
    change = trblDiff.right || trblDiff.left;
    spacePos = shape.x + (trblDiff.right ? shape.width : 0) + (trblDiff.right ? -10 : 10);
    direction = trblDiff.right ? 'e' : 'w';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix makes the horizontal resizing logic consistent with the vertical resizing logic by using the same offset value (`10`) for both directions. The inconsistency in these values could be causing the weird dimensions when converting a subprocess to an Ad Hoc subprocess, as the space calculations would be different for horizontal vs. vertical adjustments.

The value `100` seems unusually large compared to the `-10` used for the right direction, and this inconsistency could be causing the unexpected resizing behavior seen in the issue.
