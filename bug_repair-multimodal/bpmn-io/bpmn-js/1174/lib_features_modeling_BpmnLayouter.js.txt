I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about broken connection layout when reconnecting to create a loop. When a connection with more than 2 waypoints is reconnected to form a loop (connecting back to the source), the layout is incorrect.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `BpmnLayouter.prototype.layoutConnection` method. When a connection is made from an element back to itself (a loop), the code sets `manhattanOptions` with a preferred layout of `'b:l'` (bottom to left). However, this doesn't take into account the existing waypoints of the connection when it's being reconnected to form a loop.

The issue is that when reconnecting an existing connection with multiple waypoints to form a loop, the layout algorithm doesn't properly handle the existing waypoints and forces a specific layout pattern.

## Fix

We need to modify the code to preserve the existing waypoints when reconnecting to form a loop, rather than forcing a specific layout:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (source === target) {
      manhattanOptions = {
        preferredLayouts: [ 'b:l' ]
      };
    } else
=======
    if (source === target) {
      // When reconnecting to create a loop and we have existing waypoints,
      // preserve them instead of forcing a specific layout
      if (waypoints && waypoints.length > 2) {
        return [].concat([ start ], waypoints.slice(1, -1), [ end ]);
      } else {
        manhattanOptions = {
          preferredLayouts: [ 'b:l' ]
        };
      }
    } else
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change checks if we're dealing with a loop (source === target) and if the connection already has more than 2 waypoints. If both conditions are true, it preserves the existing waypoints and just updates the start and end points. Otherwise, it applies the default loop layout (bottom to left).

This should fix the issue by maintaining the existing connection layout when reconnecting to form a loop, rather than forcing a new layout.
