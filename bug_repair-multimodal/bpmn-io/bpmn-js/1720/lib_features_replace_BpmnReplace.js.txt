I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when transforming a Call Activity into an expanded SubProcess, the shape doesn't resize properly. The resulting element visually looks like a task (too small for a subprocess) and the user can't transform it back to a call activity.

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `replaceElement` function in `BpmnReplace.js`. When transforming from a Call Activity to a SubProcess, the code doesn't properly handle the size adjustment. The issue is in the condition that determines when to copy the size from the old element to the new element.

Currently, the code only copies the size when:
1. The old element is expanded
2. The old element is not a Task
3. The new element is expanded

But when transforming from a Call Activity to a SubProcess, the Call Activity isn't considered a SubProcess by the `isSubProcess` check, so the size isn't properly copied.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
      // TODO: need also to respect min/max Size
      // copy size, from an expanded subprocess to an expanded alternative subprocess
      // except bpmn:Task, because Task is always expanded
      if ((isExpanded(element) && !is(oldBusinessObject, 'bpmn:Task')) && newElement.isExpanded) {
        newElement.width = element.width;
        newElement.height = element.height;
      }
=======
      // TODO: need also to respect min/max Size
      // copy size, from an expanded subprocess or call activity to an expanded alternative subprocess
      // except bpmn:Task, because Task is always expanded
      if ((isExpanded(element) && !is(oldBusinessObject, 'bpmn:Task') || is(oldBusinessObject, 'bpmn:CallActivity')) && newElement.isExpanded) {
        newElement.width = element.width;
        newElement.height = element.height;
      }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Additionally, we need to add the missing `isSubProcess` function that's used in the code but not defined in the provided snippet:

```javascript
### lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * Compute intersection between two arrays.
 */

=======
/**
 * Compute intersection between two arrays.
 */
function intersection(a, b) {
  return a.filter(function(e) {
    return b.indexOf(e) !== -1;
  });
}

/**
 * Check if element is a subprocess (expanded or collapsed).
 */
function isSubProcess(bo) {
  return is(bo, 'bpmn:SubProcess');
}

/**
 * Check if element has the given event definition type.
 */
function hasEventDefinition(element, type) {
  if (!isArray(element.eventDefinitions)) {
    return false;
  }

  return element.eventDefinitions.some(function(definition) {
    return is(definition, type);
  });
}

/**
 * Copy a collection of properties from source to target.
 */
function copyProperties(source, target, properties) {
  if (!source || !target) {
    return;
  }

  properties.forEach(function(property) {
    if (!isUndefined(source[property])) {
      target[property] = source[property];
    }
  });
}

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the condition to also copy the size when the old element is a Call Activity and the new element is an expanded SubProcess. This ensures that when transforming from a Call Activity to a SubProcess, the size is properly maintained, making the SubProcess visually distinct from a Task.
