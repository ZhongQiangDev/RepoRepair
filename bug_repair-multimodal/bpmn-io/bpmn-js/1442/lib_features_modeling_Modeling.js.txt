I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is about pasting multiple shapes onto a connection (sequence flow) resulting in unexpected connections. Based on the GIF in the issue, when multiple shapes are pasted onto a flow, they're not properly connected in sequence.

The problem is likely in the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file mentioned in the issue description, which handles the behavior when elements are dropped onto a flow. However, it seems this behavior doesn't properly handle multiple shapes being pasted at once.

Since we don't have direct access to the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file in the provided code segments, I need to look at the related functionality in the `Modeling.js` file. The issue is likely related to how connections are created when multiple elements are pasted onto a flow.

## Solution

The issue is that when multiple shapes are pasted onto a flow, the system needs to connect them in sequence. The current implementation in `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` probably only handles single shape drops.

Let's modify the `connect` method in `Modeling.js` to better handle this case:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
Modeling.prototype.connect = function(source, target, attrs, hints) {

  var bpmnRules = this._bpmnRules;

  if (!attrs) {
    attrs = bpmnRules.canConnect(source, target);
  }

  if (!attrs) {
    return;
  }

  return this.createConnection(source, target, attrs, source.parent, hints);
};
=======
Modeling.prototype.connect = function(source, target, attrs, hints) {

  var bpmnRules = this._bpmnRules;

  if (!attrs) {
    attrs = bpmnRules.canConnect(source, target);
  }

  if (!attrs) {
    return;
  }

  return this.createConnection(source, target, attrs, source.parent, hints);
};

/**
 * Create a connection between a source and target element.
 *
 * @param {Array<djs.model.Base>} sources
 * @param {Array<djs.model.Base>} targets
 * @param {Object|Object[]} attrs
 * @param {djs.model.Base} parent
 * @param {Object} hints
 *
 * @return {Array<djs.model.Connection>} the created connections
 */
Modeling.prototype.connectSequence = function(sources, targets, attrs, parent, hints) {
  if (!sources || !targets || !sources.length || !targets.length) {
    return [];
  }

  // If we have multiple sources and targets, connect them in sequence
  // This is used when pasting multiple shapes onto a connection
  var connections = [];
  var elements = sources.concat(targets);
  
  // Sort elements by their position to ensure proper sequence
  elements.sort(function(a, b) {
    return a.x - b.x;
  });
  
  // Connect elements in sequence
  for (var i = 0; i < elements.length - 1; i++) {
    var connection = this.connect(elements[i], elements[i + 1], attrs, hints);
    if (connection) {
      connections.push(connection);
    }
  }
  
  return connections;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adds a new `connectSequence` method that can handle connecting multiple elements in sequence. The method sorts the elements by their x-coordinate to ensure they're connected in the correct order from left to right.

However, this is only part of the solution. The actual issue is in the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file which needs to use this new method when multiple shapes are dropped on a flow. Since we don't have access to that file in the provided code segments, I'll provide guidance on what needs to be changed there:

In `DropOnFlowBehavior.js`, you would need to modify the code that handles dropping elements on a flow to use the new `connectSequence` method when multiple elements are being dropped. The existing code likely only handles a single element drop.
