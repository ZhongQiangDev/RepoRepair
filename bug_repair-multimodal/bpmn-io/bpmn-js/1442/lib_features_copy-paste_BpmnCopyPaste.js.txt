I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is about pasting multiple shapes onto a connection (sequence flow) resulting in unexpected connections. Based on the GIF in the issue, when multiple shapes are copied and pasted onto a sequence flow, they're not properly connected in a logical sequence.

The problem is in the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file. When multiple elements are pasted onto a connection, the `DropOnFlowBehavior` doesn't handle this case correctly. The current implementation doesn't have any special handling for pasting multiple shapes onto a connection.

The issue is that the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file doesn't emit any event or provide information that multiple elements are being pasted onto a connection. The `DropOnFlowBehavior` needs to know that multiple elements are being pasted to handle them properly.

## Fix

We need to modify the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file to add information about multiple elements being pasted. This will allow the `DropOnFlowBehavior` to handle this case correctly.

```javascript
### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElements', function() {
    references = {};
  });
=======
  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElements', function(context) {
    references = {};
    
    // Add information about multiple elements being pasted
    if (isArray(context.elements) && context.elements.length > 1) {
      context.hints = context.hints || {};
      context.hints.multipleElements = true;
    }
  });
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a hint to the context when multiple elements are being pasted. The `DropOnFlowBehavior` can then check for this hint and handle multiple elements appropriately.

However, this is only part of the solution. The `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file also needs to be modified to handle this case. Since that file wasn't provided in the code segments, I'll describe what needs to be changed:

In the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file, we need to add logic to check for the `multipleElements` hint and handle it by connecting the pasted elements in sequence. When multiple elements are pasted onto a flow, they should be connected in a logical sequence, with the first element connected to the source of the flow, the last element connected to the target of the flow, and all elements in between connected sequentially.

The fix I've provided adds the necessary information to the context, which is the first step in solving this issue. The complete solution would require modifications to the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file as well.
