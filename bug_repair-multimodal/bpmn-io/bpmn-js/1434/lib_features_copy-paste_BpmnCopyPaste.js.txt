I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that typed start events can be pasted onto a subprocess, which shouldn't be allowed. According to BPMN rules, typed start events are not allowed within a subprocess.

Looking at the code, I can see that the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file handles the copy-paste functionality, but it doesn't have any validation to prevent pasting typed start events onto subprocesses.

The bug is in the paste functionality - we need to add validation to check if the element being pasted is a typed start event and if the target is a subprocess, and prevent the paste operation in that case.

## Fix

We need to add validation in the `copyPaste.pasteElement` event handler to check if the element being pasted is a typed start event and if the target is a subprocess.

```javascript
### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElement', function(context) {
    var cache = context.cache,
        descriptor = context.descriptor,
        oldBusinessObject = descriptor.oldBusinessObject,
        newBusinessObject;

    // do NOT copy business object if external label
    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {
      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[ descriptor.labelTarget ]);

      return;
    }

  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElement', function(context) {
    var cache = context.cache,
        descriptor = context.descriptor,
        oldBusinessObject = descriptor.oldBusinessObject,
        newBusinessObject,
        target = context.target;

    // do NOT copy business object if external label
    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {
      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[ descriptor.labelTarget ]);

      return;
    }

    // do NOT allow pasting typed start events onto subprocesses
    if (descriptor.type === 'bpmn:StartEvent' && 
        oldBusinessObject.eventDefinitions && 
        oldBusinessObject.eventDefinitions.length > 0 && 
        is(target, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
      context.cancel = true;
      return;
    }

    // do NOT allow pasting non-interrupting events out of event sub-processes
    if (descriptor.type === 'bpmn:StartEvent' && 
        oldBusinessObject.isInterrupting === false && 
        !is(target, 'bpmn:SubProcess')) {
      context.cancel = true;
      return;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds two validation checks:

1. It prevents pasting typed start events (start events with event definitions) onto subprocesses
2. It also prevents pasting non-interrupting events out of event sub-processes, which was mentioned as a related issue in the comment

The fix sets `context.cancel = true` to prevent the paste operation when these conditions are met.
