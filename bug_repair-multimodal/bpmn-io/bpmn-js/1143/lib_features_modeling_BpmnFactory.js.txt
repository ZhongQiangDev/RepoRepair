I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

Based on the issue description and the error shown in the screenshots:

1. When a group is added to an empty diagram, and then trying to add other elements like a pool, the editor crashes.
2. The console shows errors related to "Cannot read property 'width' of undefined" and "Cannot read property 'height' of undefined".

Looking at the provided code snippet from `BpmnFactory.js`, I can see the `createDiShape` method which is responsible for creating diagram shapes. The issue likely occurs because when adding a group to an empty diagram, there might be no proper bounds handling for this specific scenario.

The error suggests that when trying to create a shape after adding a group, the bounds object is undefined or missing properties, causing the crash when trying to access `width` and `height`.

## Fix

We need to ensure that the `createDiBounds` method properly handles cases where bounds might be undefined or incomplete. Let's add a check to ensure bounds are properly initialized:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BpmnFactory.prototype.createDiShape = function(semantic, bounds, attrs) {

  return this.create('bpmndi:BPMNShape', assign({
    bpmnElement: semantic,
    bounds: this.createDiBounds(bounds)
  }, attrs));
};
=======
BpmnFactory.prototype.createDiShape = function(semantic, bounds, attrs) {
  // Ensure bounds is an object with required properties
  bounds = bounds || { x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 80 };

  return this.create('bpmndi:BPMNShape', assign({
    bpmnElement: semantic,
    bounds: this.createDiBounds(bounds)
  }, attrs));
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that even if bounds is undefined or missing properties, we provide default values to prevent the errors. The default values (x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 80) are reasonable defaults for a new shape, but these could be adjusted based on the application's requirements.
