I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when a label is cleared from a task, the `di` (diagram interchange) object still has a `label` property with a value of `null`. According to the expected behavior, the `label` property should not exist at all when the label is cleared.

This issue was introduced when support for embedded label DIs was added. The problem is in the `LabelEditingProvider.prototype.update` method, which is responsible for updating labels. When a label is cleared, it sets the label value to `null`, but it doesn't remove the property entirely from the diagram interchange object.

## Solution

We need to modify the `update` method to completely remove the `label` property from the diagram interchange object when the label is cleared, rather than just setting it to `null`.

```javascript
### lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (isEmptyText(newLabel)) {
    newLabel = null;
  }

  this._modeling.updateLabel(element, newLabel, newBounds);
=======
  if (isEmptyText(newLabel)) {
    newLabel = null;
  }

  this._modeling.updateLabel(element, newLabel, newBounds);

  // If the label was removed, also remove the label property from the DI
  if (newLabel === null && element.di && element.di.label) {
    delete element.di.label;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds code to check if the label was removed (set to null) and if the element has a diagram interchange object with a label property. If both conditions are true, it removes the label property from the diagram interchange object.
