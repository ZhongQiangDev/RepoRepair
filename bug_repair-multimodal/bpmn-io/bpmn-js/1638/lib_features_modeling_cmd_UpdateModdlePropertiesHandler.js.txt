I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when a label is cleared from a Task, the property `label` still exists in the DI (diagram interchange) object but with a value of `null`. This causes issues with linting tools. The expected behavior is that the `label` property should be completely removed when cleared.

This issue was introduced when support for embedded label DIs was added. The problem is likely in the `setModdleProperties` function which is used in the `UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler`. When a property is set to `null`, it's still being kept in the object instead of being deleted.

## Fix

We need to modify the `setModdleProperties` function to remove properties that are set to `null` instead of keeping them with a null value. However, this function is not shown in the provided code segment. 

Let's look for the implementation of `getModdleProperties` and `setModdleProperties` functions in the file, which should be defined somewhere in the same file. Since they're not visible in the provided code, I'll create a fix assuming they're defined at the end of the file:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateModdlePropertiesHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * Return visual references of given moddle element within the diagram.
 *
 * @param {ModdleElement} moddleElement
 *
 * @return {Array<djs.model.Element>}
 */











=======
/**
 * Return visual references of given moddle element within the diagram.
 *
 * @param {ModdleElement} moddleElement
 *
 * @return {Array<djs.model.Element>}
 */

/**
 * Get properties of given moddle element.
 *
 * @param {ModdleElement} moddleElement
 * @param {Array<string>} propertyNames
 *
 * @return {Object}
 */
function getModdleProperties(moddleElement, propertyNames) {
  return reduce(propertyNames, function(result, key) {
    result[key] = moddleElement.get(key);
    return result;
  }, {});
}

/**
 * Set properties of given moddle element.
 *
 * @param {ModdleElement} moddleElement
 * @param {Object} properties
 */
function setModdleProperties(moddleElement, properties) {
  forEach(properties, function(value, key) {
    if (value === null) {
      // Remove property completely when null
      moddleElement.$model.removeDescriptor(moddleElement, key);
      delete moddleElement[key];
    } else {
      moddleElement.set(key, value);
    }
  });
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the `setModdleProperties` function to completely remove properties when their value is set to `null`, rather than setting them to null. This should resolve the issue where the `label` property exists with a null value after clearing the label.

Note: Since I don't have the complete file, I'm making an educated guess about the implementation of these functions. The actual implementation might be different, but the principle of the fix remains the same: when a property is set to `null`, it should be completely removed from the object.
