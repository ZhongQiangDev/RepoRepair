I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, there are two related problems:
1. When selecting events or gateways, they become smaller or disappear
2. Completing direct editing with an empty label resizes elements to minimum bounds

Looking at the code, I notice that the `ResizeBehavior.js` file sets minimum dimensions for various BPMN elements, but it doesn't set minimum dimensions for events and gateways, which explains why they're shrinking or disappearing when selected.

The issue was introduced in commit e4e789bd3eecc47597d97d6c8f1e71b941dee066, which likely changed how element resizing works without properly handling events and gateways.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export var PARTICIPANT_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 300, height: 150 };

export var SUB_PROCESS_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 140, height: 120 };

export var TEXT_ANNOTATION_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 50, height: 30 };

=======
export var PARTICIPANT_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 300, height: 150 };

export var SUB_PROCESS_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 140, height: 120 };

export var TEXT_ANNOTATION_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 50, height: 30 };

export var EVENT_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 36, height: 36 };

export var GATEWAY_MIN_DIMENSIONS = { width: 50, height: 50 };

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if (is(shape, 'bpmn:TextAnnotation')) {
      context.minDimensions = TEXT_ANNOTATION_MIN_DIMENSIONS;
    }
=======
    if (is(shape, 'bpmn:TextAnnotation')) {
      context.minDimensions = TEXT_ANNOTATION_MIN_DIMENSIONS;
    }

    if (is(shape, 'bpmn:Event') || shape.type.indexOf('Event') !== -1) {
      context.minDimensions = EVENT_MIN_DIMENSIONS;
    }

    if (is(shape, 'bpmn:Gateway') || shape.type.indexOf('Gateway') !== -1) {
      context.minDimensions = GATEWAY_MIN_DIMENSIONS;
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds minimum dimensions for events and gateways, ensuring they maintain their proper size when selected or when their labels are edited. The check includes both the direct BPMN type and a string search in the type name to catch all event and gateway subtypes.
