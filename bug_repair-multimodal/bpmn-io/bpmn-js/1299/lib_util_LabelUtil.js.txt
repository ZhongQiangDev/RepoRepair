I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue has two related problems:

1. When selecting events or gateways, they become smaller or disappear
2. Completing direct editing with an empty label resizes elements to minimum bounds

Looking at the code and the issue description, the problem appears to be in the `getExternalLabelBounds` function in `lib/util/LabelUtil.js`. The issue was introduced in commit e4e789b, which likely changed how label sizes are calculated.

The problem occurs because when a label is empty, the code is not maintaining a minimum size for the label bounds, causing elements to shrink or disappear when selected.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/util/LabelUtil.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  if (label && label.bounds) {
    bounds = label.bounds;

    size = {
      width: Math.max(DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.width, bounds.width),
      height: bounds.height
    };

    mid = {
      x: bounds.x + bounds.width / 2,
      y: bounds.y + bounds.height / 2
    };
  } else {
=======
  if (label && label.bounds) {
    bounds = label.bounds;

    size = {
      width: Math.max(DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.width, bounds.width),
      height: Math.max(DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE.height, bounds.height)
    };

    mid = {
      x: bounds.x + bounds.width / 2,
      y: bounds.y + bounds.height / 2
    };
  } else {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that both the width AND height of the label have minimum values based on the `DEFAULT_LABEL_SIZE` constants. The original code was only enforcing a minimum width but not a minimum height, which caused elements to shrink or disappear when their labels were empty.

By enforcing a minimum height as well, we ensure that even when a label is empty, the element maintains a reasonable size and remains visible and clickable.
