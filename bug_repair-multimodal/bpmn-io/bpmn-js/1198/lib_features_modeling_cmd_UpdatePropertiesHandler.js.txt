I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event (or other catch events) is added to a non-default flow from an exclusive gateway, the `default` attribute on the gateway is being removed. This happens even though the default flow is still visually rendered as the default.

Looking at the code, the problem appears to be in the `UpdatePropertiesHandler.prototype.execute` method. When properties are updated, the code correctly handles visual changes for default flow updates, but when the `execute` method is called to update properties for other elements (like adding a catch event), it doesn't preserve the `default` attribute on related gateways.

The issue is likely in how properties are set on the business object. The `setProperties` function is updating all properties without preserving special references like the `default` flow.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
// update properties
  setProperties(businessObject, properties);

  // store old values
  context.oldProperties = oldProperties;
  context.changed = changed;
=======
  // update properties
  setProperties(businessObject, properties);

  // ensure default flow reference is not lost when updating properties
  // on sequence flows (e.g., when adding intermediate catch events)
  if (element.source && element.source.businessObject && 
      element.source.businessObject.default === businessObject) {
    element.source.businessObject.default = businessObject;
  }

  // store old values
  context.oldProperties = oldProperties;
  context.changed = changed;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a check to ensure that if the element being updated is a sequence flow that is set as the default flow of its source node (like an exclusive gateway), the default reference is preserved after updating the properties.

The solution works by checking if the current element's source has a business object with a default flow reference pointing to the current element's business object. If so, it explicitly reassigns this reference to ensure it's not lost during property updates.
