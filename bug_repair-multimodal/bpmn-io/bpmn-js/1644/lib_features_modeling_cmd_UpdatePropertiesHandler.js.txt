I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when changing a task from parallel multi-instance to sequential multi-instance (or vice versa), the multi-instance properties like loop cardinality are lost. This happens because the current implementation of the `UpdatePropertiesHandler` doesn't properly preserve these properties when switching between multi-instance types.

Looking at the code, the problem is likely in the `setProperties` function which is called in the `execute` method. The issue is that when changing the multi-instance type, the properties related to multi-instance behavior are not being preserved.

The bug is not directly visible in the provided code snippet, as the `setProperties` function implementation is not shown. However, based on the issue description, we need to modify the `UpdatePropertiesHandler` to preserve multi-instance properties when switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance types.

## Fix

We need to modify the `execute` method to preserve multi-instance properties when changing between parallel and sequential multi-instance types. Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  // update properties
  setProperties(element, properties);

  // store old values
  context.oldProperties = oldProperties;
  context.changed = changed;
=======
  // preserve multi-instance properties when switching between sequential and parallel
  if ('isSequential' in properties && businessObject.loopCharacteristics) {
    var loopCharacteristics = businessObject.loopCharacteristics;
    
    // store multi-instance properties before update
    var multiInstanceProps = {
      loopCardinality: loopCharacteristics.loopCardinality,
      loopDataInputRef: loopCharacteristics.loopDataInputRef,
      loopDataOutputRef: loopCharacteristics.loopDataOutputRef,
      inputDataItem: loopCharacteristics.inputDataItem,
      outputDataItem: loopCharacteristics.outputDataItem,
      completionCondition: loopCharacteristics.completionCondition
    };
    
    // update properties
    setProperties(element, properties);
    
    // restore multi-instance properties after update
    if (businessObject.loopCharacteristics) {
      forEach(multiInstanceProps, function(value, key) {
        if (value !== undefined) {
          businessObject.loopCharacteristics[key] = value;
        }
      });
    }
  } else {
    // update properties normally
    setProperties(element, properties);
  }

  // store old values
  context.oldProperties = oldProperties;
  context.changed = changed;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix identifies when the `isSequential` property is being changed (which happens when switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance). It then preserves the important multi-instance properties like loop cardinality, loop data references, data items, and completion condition before the update, and restores them after the update.

This ensures that when switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance types, the multi-instance properties are not lost.
