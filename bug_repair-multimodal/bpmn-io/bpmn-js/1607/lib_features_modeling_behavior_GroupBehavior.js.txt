I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that when a group is created inside a collapsed sub-process and the diagram is saved and re-imported, there's a warning about an unresolved reference to a CategoryValue. This suggests that the CategoryValue created for the group isn't being properly attached to the definitions.

Looking at the code, I can see that the problem is in the `getDefinitions()` function. When working with elements inside a collapsed sub-process, the root element's business object's parent might not be the definitions directly. We need to traverse up the parent chain until we find the definitions element.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/GroupBehavior.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  /**
   * Gets process definitions
   *
   * @return {ModdleElement} definitions
   */
  function getDefinitions() {
    var rootElement = canvas.getRootElement(),
        businessObject = getBusinessObject(rootElement);

    return businessObject.$parent;
  }
=======
  /**
   * Gets process definitions
   *
   * @return {ModdleElement} definitions
   */
  function getDefinitions() {
    var rootElement = canvas.getRootElement(),
        businessObject = getBusinessObject(rootElement);

    // traverse up the parent chain until we find the definitions
    var definitions = businessObject.$parent;
    
    while (definitions && definitions.$type !== 'bpmn:Definitions') {
      definitions = definitions.$parent;
    }

    return definitions;
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the `getDefinitions()` function to traverse up the parent chain until it finds an element with the type 'bpmn:Definitions', ensuring that we always get the correct definitions object regardless of how deeply nested the group is in the process hierarchy.
