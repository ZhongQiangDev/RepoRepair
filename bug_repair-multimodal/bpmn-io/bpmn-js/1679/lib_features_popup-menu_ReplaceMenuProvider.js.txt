I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description and the GIF, the problem occurs when toggling between parallel and sequential multi-instance markers. The XML label isn't being updated correctly when switching between these options.

Looking at the code in `ReplaceMenuProvider.js`, the issue is in the `toggleLoopEntry` function. When a user toggles from one multi-instance type to another, the code is not correctly updating the `isSequential` property on the existing loop characteristics object. Instead, it's checking if the entry is active and then either removing the loop characteristics entirely or creating a new one.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  function toggleLoopEntry(event, entry) {
    var loopCharacteristics = getBusinessObject(element).loopCharacteristics;

    if (entry.active) {
      loopCharacteristics = undefined;
    } else {
      if (isUndefined(entry.options.isSequential) || !loopCharacteristics) {
        loopCharacteristics = self._moddle.create(entry.options.loopCharacteristics);
      }

      loopCharacteristics.isSequential = entry.options.isSequential;
    }
    self._modeling.updateProperties(element, { loopCharacteristics: loopCharacteristics });
  }
=======
  function toggleLoopEntry(event, entry) {
    var loopCharacteristics = getBusinessObject(element).loopCharacteristics;

    if (entry.active) {
      loopCharacteristics = undefined;
    } else {
      if (!loopCharacteristics || loopCharacteristics.$type !== entry.options.loopCharacteristics) {
        loopCharacteristics = self._moddle.create(entry.options.loopCharacteristics);
      }

      if (!isUndefined(entry.options.isSequential)) {
        loopCharacteristics.isSequential = entry.options.isSequential;
      }
    }
    self._modeling.updateProperties(element, { loopCharacteristics: loopCharacteristics });
  }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

The fix makes two important changes:

1. It checks if the existing loop characteristics are of the same type as the one we're trying to set. If not, it creates a new one.
2. It only sets the `isSequential` property if it's defined in the options, which ensures we're not accidentally setting it to undefined when toggling the standard loop.

This will ensure that when switching between parallel and sequential multi-instance markers, the XML label is correctly updated with the `isSequential` attribute.
