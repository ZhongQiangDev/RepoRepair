I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that docking snapping functionality is broken in v4-beta. When moving elements that should snap to docking points, they no longer do so. Looking at the provided code, I notice a critical function is missing from the file.

The error is that the `sq()` function is referenced in the `getDistance()` function, but it's not defined in the code. There's a comment for the `sq()` function, but the actual implementation is missing. This would cause the distance calculation to fail, which would break the snapping functionality.

## Fix

```javascript
### lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LineAttachmentUtil.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * Calculate the square (power to two) of a number.
 *
 * @param {Number} n
 *
 * @return {Number}
 */


/**
 * Get distance between two points.
=======
/**
 * Calculate the square (power to two) of a number.
 *
 * @param {Number} n
 *
 * @return {Number}
 */
function sq(n) {
  return n * n;
}

/**
 * Get distance between two points.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the missing `sq()` function implementation that calculates the square of a number. The function is referenced in `getDistance()` but was not defined, which would cause errors when trying to calculate distances between points. This would break the docking snapping functionality since it relies on accurate distance calculations to determine where to snap elements.
