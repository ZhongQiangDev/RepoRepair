I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

Based on the issue description and the GIF, the problem is that when a user wraps a process in a pool, the diagram jumps or shifts in the viewport. The expected behavior is that the diagram should stay in the current viewport without jumping.

Looking at the code, the issue is likely related to how the diagram is rendered after modifications. The `BaseViewer.js` file contains the core functionality for rendering BPMN diagrams.

The problem appears to be in the viewport handling during diagram updates. When a process is wrapped in a pool, the diagram is re-rendered, but the viewport position isn't properly maintained.

## Fix

The issue is likely in the `importDefinitions` method in `BaseViewer.js`. When the diagram is updated (such as when wrapping a process in a pool), we need to ensure the viewport position is preserved.

```javascript
### lib/BaseViewer.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
BaseViewer.prototype.importDefinitions = wrapForCompatibility(function importDefinitions(definitions, bpmnDiagram) {

  var self = this;

  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {

    self._setDefinitions(definitions);

    self.open(bpmnDiagram).then(function(result) {

      var warnings = result.warnings;

      return resolve({ warnings: warnings });
    }).catch(function(err) {

      return reject(err);
    });
  });
});
=======
BaseViewer.prototype.importDefinitions = wrapForCompatibility(function importDefinitions(definitions, bpmnDiagram) {

  var self = this;

  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Store the current viewport before updating the diagram
    var canvas = self.get('canvas');
    var viewbox = canvas.viewbox();
    
    self._setDefinitions(definitions);

    self.open(bpmnDiagram).then(function(result) {
      // Restore the viewport after the diagram has been rendered
      if (viewbox) {
        canvas.viewbox(viewbox);
      }

      var warnings = result.warnings;

      return resolve({ warnings: warnings });
    }).catch(function(err) {

      return reject(err);
    });
  });
});
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix captures the current viewport position before updating the diagram and restores it after the diagram has been rendered. This should prevent the diagram from jumping when a process is wrapped in a pool.

The `canvas.viewbox()` method gets the current viewport information, and `canvas.viewbox(viewbox)` sets it back to the same position after the diagram is rendered.
