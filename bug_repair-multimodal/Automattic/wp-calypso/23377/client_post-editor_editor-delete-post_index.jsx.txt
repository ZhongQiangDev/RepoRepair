# Bug Analysis

Based on the issue description, the problem is that when a user trashes a post in the editor, they immediately get a dialog asking them to restore it. This happens because the editor is still trying to edit a post that has been moved to trash.

The bug is in the `EditorDeletePost` component. When a post is trashed, the component calls the `onTrashingPost` callback, but it doesn't navigate away from the editor. This causes the editor to remain open with a now-trashed post, which triggers the restore dialog.

# Fix

We need to modify the `sendToTrash` method to ensure that after trashing a post, the user is redirected away from the editor. The callback `onTrashingPost` is already being called, but it seems the callback isn't handling navigation properly.

```javascript
### client/post-editor/editor-delete-post/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	sendToTrash = () => {
		if ( ! utils.userCan( 'delete_post', this.props.post ) ) {
			return;
		}

		this.setState( { isTrashing: true } );

		// TODO: REDUX - remove flux actions when whole post-editor is reduxified
		actions.trash( this.props.site, this.props.post, error => {
			this.setState( { isTrashing: false } );

			if ( this.props.onTrashingPost ) {
				this.props.onTrashingPost( error );
			}
		} );
	};
=======
	sendToTrash = () => {
		if ( ! utils.userCan( 'delete_post', this.props.post ) ) {
			return;
		}

		this.setState( { isTrashing: true } );

		// TODO: REDUX - remove flux actions when whole post-editor is reduxified
		actions.trash( this.props.site, this.props.post, error => {
			this.setState( { isTrashing: false } );

			if ( this.props.onTrashingPost ) {
				this.props.onTrashingPost( error );
			}
			
			// If there's no error, navigate away from the editor
			// This prevents the "restore" dialog from appearing
			if ( ! error && this.props.site ) {
				// Navigate to the posts list for this site
				window.location.href = `/posts/${ this.props.site.slug }`;
			}
		} );
	};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds navigation away from the editor after successfully trashing a post. It redirects the user to the posts list for the current site, which prevents the editor from trying to edit a trashed post and showing the restore dialog.
