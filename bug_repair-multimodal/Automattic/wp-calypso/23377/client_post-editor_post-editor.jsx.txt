I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when a user trashes a post in the editor, they immediately get a dialog asking them to restore it. This happens because:

1. The user clicks the trash button and confirms
2. The post is trashed successfully
3. But instead of redirecting the user away from the editor, they remain in the editor
4. Since the post is now trashed, the editor shows a restore dialog

Looking at the code, the problem is in the `onTrashingPost` function. When a post is successfully trashed, it only marks the post as saved but doesn't navigate the user away from the editor. Since the editor is still open with a trashed post, it shows the restore dialog.

## Fix

We need to modify the `onTrashingPost` function to redirect the user away from the editor after successfully trashing a post.

```javascript
### client/post-editor/post-editor.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	onTrashingPost: function( error ) {
		var isPage = utils.isPage( this.state.post );

		if ( error ) {
			this.setState( {
				notice: {
					status: 'is-error',
					message: 'trashFailure',
				},
			} );
		} else {
			recordStat( isPage ? 'page_trashed' : 'post_trashed' );
			recordEvent( isPage ? 'Clicked Trash Page Button' : 'Clicked Trash Post Button' );
			this.props.markSaved();
		}
	},
=======
	onTrashingPost: function( error ) {
		var isPage = utils.isPage( this.state.post );

		if ( error ) {
			this.setState( {
				notice: {
					status: 'is-error',
					message: 'trashFailure',
				},
			} );
		} else {
			recordStat( isPage ? 'page_trashed' : 'post_trashed' );
			recordEvent( isPage ? 'Clicked Trash Page Button' : 'Clicked Trash Post Button' );
			this.props.markSaved();
			
			// Redirect to the posts list
			if ( this.props.selectedSite ) {
				const siteSlug = get( this.props.selectedSite, 'slug' );
				const redirectPath = isPage ? `/pages/${ siteSlug }` : `/posts/${ siteSlug }`;
				page.redirect( redirectPath );
			}
		}
	},
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds a redirect after successfully trashing a post. It redirects the user to the posts list or pages list (depending on the content type), which prevents the restore dialog from appearing since the user is no longer in the editor.
