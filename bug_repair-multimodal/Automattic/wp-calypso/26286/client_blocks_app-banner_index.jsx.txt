I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Localization

The issue is in the `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx` file. The problem is that the app banner is showing on the `/stats/activity` page when it shouldn't be. This happens because the current implementation only checks if the section is "stats" without distinguishing between different stats sub-pages.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `getCurrentSection` function (which is imported from `./utils`). The current implementation doesn't have enough information to distinguish between different stats pages like `/stats` and `/stats/activity`.

The fix needs to check the current route to determine if we're on a specific stats sub-page like `/activity` and exclude the banner in that case.

## Fix

```javascript
### client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const mapStateToProps = state => {
	const sectionName = getSectionName( state );
	const isNotesOpen = isNotificationsOpen( state );

	return {
		dismissedUntil: getPreference( state, APP_BANNER_DISMISS_TIMES_PREFERENCE ),
		currentSection: getCurrentSection( sectionName, isNotesOpen ),
		currentRoute: getCurrentRoute( state ),
		fetchingPreferences: isFetchingPreferences( state ),
		siteId: getSelectedSiteId( state ),
	};
};
=======
const mapStateToProps = state => {
	const sectionName = getSectionName( state );
	const isNotesOpen = isNotificationsOpen( state );
	const currentRoute = getCurrentRoute( state );

	// Don't show the banner on stats sub-pages like activity
	const isStatsSubPage = sectionName === 'stats' && 
		currentRoute && 
		/^\/stats\/[^/]+\/\w+/.test( currentRoute );

	return {
		dismissedUntil: getPreference( state, APP_BANNER_DISMISS_TIMES_PREFERENCE ),
		currentSection: isStatsSubPage ? null : getCurrentSection( sectionName, isNotesOpen ),
		currentRoute,
		fetchingPreferences: isFetchingPreferences( state ),
		siteId: getSelectedSiteId( state ),
	};
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds logic to detect if we're on a stats sub-page by checking if:
1. The section name is 'stats'
2. The current route matches a pattern like `/stats/[site]/activity` (or any other sub-page)

If we're on a stats sub-page, we set `currentSection` to `null`, which will prevent the banner from showing since the render method checks if `currentSection` is included in `ALLOWED_SECTIONS`.

The regex `/^\/stats\/[^/]+\/\w+/` matches routes like `/stats/siteslug/activity` but not just `/stats/siteslug`.
