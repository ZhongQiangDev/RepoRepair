# Bug Analysis

Based on the issue description, the problem is that the "upcoming charges" section feels out of place in its current location. The issue suggests moving it to either under "Pending Payments" or creating a new "Upcoming Charges" tab of its own.

Looking at the provided code, I can see that the navigation header for the purchases section has tabs for "Purchases", "Billing History", "Pending Payments" (conditionally shown based on the 'async-payments' feature flag), and "My Memberships". However, there is no tab for "Upcoming Charges".

# Solution

I'll add a new tab for "Upcoming Charges" in the navigation header. This will be placed after the "Pending Payments" tab, which seems like a logical position based on the issue description.

```javascript
### client/me/purchases/purchases-list/header/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
				{ config.isEnabled( 'async-payments' ) && (
					<NavItem path={ purchasesRoot + '/pending' } selected={ section === 'pending' }>
						{ i18n.translate( 'Pending Payments' ) }
					</NavItem>
				) }

				<NavItem path={ purchasesRoot + '/memberships' } selected={ section === 'memberships' }>
=======
				{ config.isEnabled( 'async-payments' ) && (
					<NavItem path={ purchasesRoot + '/pending' } selected={ section === 'pending' }>
						{ i18n.translate( 'Pending Payments' ) }
					</NavItem>
				) }

				<NavItem path={ purchasesRoot + '/upcoming' } selected={ section === 'upcoming' }>
					{ i18n.translate( 'Upcoming Charges' ) }
				</NavItem>

				<NavItem path={ purchasesRoot + '/memberships' } selected={ section === 'memberships' }>
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new "Upcoming Charges" tab to the navigation header. The tab links to the '/upcoming' path under the purchases root and is selected when the section is 'upcoming'. This implementation follows the same pattern as the other tabs in the navigation.
