I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that when a user adds a featured image to a new post and then removes it, the post is incorrectly marked as "dirty" (having unsaved changes), causing the "Are You Sure?" dialog to appear when navigating away.

Looking at the code, I found the problem in the `set()` function. There's a special case to handle featured images, but it has a logic flaw:

```javascript
// This prevents an unsaved changes dialogue from appearing
// on a new post when only the featured image is added then removed.
// See #17701 for context.
if ( updatedPost.featured_image === '' && ! _savedPost.featured_image && _post.featured_image ) {
    updatedPost = omit( updatedPost, 'featured_image' );
}
```

The issue is that this condition only handles the case where:
1. The updated post has an empty featured image string (`''`)
2. The saved post doesn't have a featured image
3. The current post has a featured image

However, when a user adds a featured image to a new post and then removes it, the `featured_image` property is set to `null` rather than an empty string `''`. This means the condition never triggers, and the post is incorrectly marked as dirty.

## Fix

```javascript
### client/lib/posts/post-edit-store.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	// This prevents an unsaved changes dialogue from appearing
	// on a new post when only the featured image is added then removed.
	// See #17701 for context.
	if ( updatedPost.featured_image === '' && ! _savedPost.featured_image && _post.featured_image ) {
		updatedPost = omit( updatedPost, 'featured_image' );
	}
=======
	// This prevents an unsaved changes dialogue from appearing
	// on a new post when only the featured image is added then removed.
	// See #17701 for context.
	if ( ( updatedPost.featured_image === '' || updatedPost.featured_image === null ) && 
		! _savedPost.featured_image && 
		_post.featured_image ) {
		updatedPost = omit( updatedPost, 'featured_image' );
	}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix modifies the condition to also check for `null` values in `updatedPost.featured_image`, which handles the case where a featured image is removed from a new post. This will prevent the post from being marked as dirty when a user adds and then removes a featured image on a new post, resolving the issue described in the ticket.
