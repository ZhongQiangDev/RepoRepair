I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue occurs when a user:
1. Starts at a WPCC login page with a client_id parameter
2. Switches to signup form
3. Switches back to login form
4. Reloads the page

At this point, the client_id is lost, causing the styling to be lost. The login page appears as the standard WordPress.com login page instead of the branded/styled version.

Looking at the code, the `login()` function in `client/lib/paths/login/index.js` handles generating the login URL, but it doesn't preserve the client_id parameter when redirecting. This is why the styling is lost after the flow described in the issue.

## Fix

We need to modify the `login()` function to include the client_id parameter when it's provided:

```javascript
### client/lib/paths/login/index.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function login( {
	isNative,
	locale,
	redirectTo,
	twoFactorAuthType,
	socialConnect,
	emailAddress,
	socialService,
} = {} ) {
=======
export function login( {
	isNative,
	locale,
	redirectTo,
	twoFactorAuthType,
	socialConnect,
	emailAddress,
	socialService,
	clientId,
} = {} ) {
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### client/lib/paths/login/index.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	if ( emailAddress ) {
		url = addQueryArgs( { email_address: emailAddress }, url );
	}

	return url;
=======
	if ( emailAddress ) {
		url = addQueryArgs( { email_address: emailAddress }, url );
	}

	if ( clientId ) {
		url = addQueryArgs( { client_id: clientId }, url );
	}

	return url;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a new parameter `clientId` to the function signature and ensures that if a client_id is provided, it will be included in the generated URL. This will preserve the client_id when switching between login and signup forms, ensuring the proper styling is maintained even after page reloads.
