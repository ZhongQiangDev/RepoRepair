I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Bug Localization

Based on the issue description, we need to add an app nudge to the Checklist "congratulations" screen. The issue mentions that the app nudge was removed from the Checklist since it's more of a post-launch onboarding nudge. The mock shows a view from `/me/get-apps` that should be added to the congratulations screen.

Looking at the provided code, we're seeing the `MobileDownloadCard` component from `client/me/get-apps/mobile-download-card.jsx`. This component appears to be the app nudge that needs to be added to the congratulations screen. However, the code doesn't show any issues with this component itself - it's just not being used in the congratulations screen.

The bug is that this component needs to be imported and used in the congratulations screen component, which is not shown in the provided code. Since we don't have the congratulations screen component code, I'll need to make an educated guess about what changes are needed.

## Solution

Since we don't have the actual congratulations screen component, I'll provide a general solution for how to import and use the `MobileDownloadCard` component in that file. The exact implementation might need adjustments based on the actual code structure.

```javascript
### client/my-sites/checklist/wpcom-checklist/checklist-completion/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import React from 'react';
=======
import React from 'react';
import MobileDownloadCard from 'me/get-apps/mobile-download-card';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### client/my-sites/checklist/wpcom-checklist/checklist-completion/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
				<div className="checklist-completion__footer">
					<Button primary href={ `/stats/day/${ siteSlug }` }>
						{ translate( 'See my site stats' ) }
					</Button>
				</div>
=======
				<div className="checklist-completion__footer">
					<Button primary href={ `/stats/day/${ siteSlug }` }>
						{ translate( 'See my site stats' ) }
					</Button>
				</div>
				
				<MobileDownloadCard />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Note: The exact placement of the `MobileDownloadCard` component might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the congratulations screen component. The mock shows it should be added below the existing content, so I've placed it after the footer section.

If the congratulations screen component has a different file path or structure, the above solution would need to be adjusted accordingly. The key point is to import the `MobileDownloadCard` component and add it to the render method of the congratulations screen component.
