I'll analyze the issue and provide a solution.

## Bug Localization

The issue is in the `HappinessSupport` component, specifically in the `getSupportText()` method. The problem is that the text in the "Priority support" card has a widow (a single word on its own line) when the browser is resized. The word "account." appears on its own line, which is not desired.

The issue mentions that applying `preventWidows()` directly to `this.getSupportText()` doesn't work because of the `<strong />` component in the text. This suggests we need to apply the widow prevention to the text content while preserving the HTML structure.

## Solution

We need to import the `preventWidows` utility and apply it to the text content while preserving the HTML structure. The solution is to apply `preventWidows()` to the text portions separately, before they're inserted into the component structure.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
/**
 * External dependencies
 */

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import classNames from 'classnames';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { localize } from 'i18n-calypso';

/**

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import classNames from 'classnames';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { localize } from 'i18n-calypso';
import { preventWidows } from 'lib/formatting';
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	getSupportText() {
		const { isJetpackFreePlan, translate } = this.props;
		const components = {
			strong: <strong />,
		};
		return isJetpackFreePlan
			? translate(
					'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} Search our support site to find out about your site, your account, and how to make the most of WordPress.',
					{ components }
			  )
			: translate(
					'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} A Happiness Engineer can answer questions about your site and your account.',
					{ components }
			  );
	}
=======
	getSupportText() {
		const { isJetpackFreePlan, translate } = this.props;
		const components = {
			strong: <strong />,
		};
		return isJetpackFreePlan
			? translate(
					'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} ' + 
					preventWidows('Search our support site to find out about your site, your account, and how to make the most of WordPress.'),
					{ components }
			  )
			: translate(
					'{{strong}}Need help?{{/strong}} ' + 
					preventWidows('A Happiness Engineer can answer questions about your site and your account.'),
					{ components }
			  );
	}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This solution:

1. Imports the `preventWidows` utility from 'lib/formatting'
2. Applies `preventWidows()` to the text portion after the `<strong>` element
3. Concatenates the `<strong>` part with the widow-prevented text

This approach ensures that the text "your account." will stay together on the same line when the browser is resized, solving the widow issue while preserving the HTML structure.
