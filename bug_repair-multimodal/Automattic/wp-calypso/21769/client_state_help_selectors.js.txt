I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue occurs when a user has no primary site selected and tries to access the contact form. The error message indicates that the code is trying to access the `ID` property of a null object. Looking at the code, I can see that `getHelpSelectedSite` might return `null` when no site is selected or available, but `getHelpSelectedSiteId` doesn't properly handle this case.

The problem is in the `getHelpSelectedSiteId` function. It checks if `site` exists and has an `ID` property, but if `site` is `null`, the function doesn't explicitly return `null` - it falls through to the end where it returns `null` anyway, but the code structure could be clearer.

More importantly, the error is happening because somewhere in the application, code is trying to use the site ID without checking if it's null first. The fix should ensure that the `getHelpSelectedSiteId` function properly handles the case when no site is available.

## Fix

```javascript
### client/state/help/selectors.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const getHelpSelectedSiteId = state => {
	const site = getHelpSelectedSite( state );

	if ( site && site.ID ) {
		return site.ID;
	}
	return null;
};
=======
export const getHelpSelectedSiteId = state => {
	const site = getHelpSelectedSite( state );

	if ( site && site.ID ) {
		return site.ID;
	}
	return null;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Wait, the code actually looks correct already. The issue must be in how this selector is being used. The error occurs when trying to access the `ID` property of a null object, but this selector already returns `null` when there's no site.

Let me revise my approach. The issue is likely that the component using this selector isn't properly handling the case when `getHelpSelectedSiteId` returns `null`. However, since we don't have access to that component code, we can make the selector more robust by ensuring it always returns a valid site ID or a clear fallback value.

```javascript
### client/state/help/selectors.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const getHelpSelectedSite = state => {
	const siteId = getHelpSiteId( state ) || getSelectedOrPrimarySiteId( state );

	return getSite( state, siteId );
};

export const getHelpSelectedSiteId = state => {
	const site = getHelpSelectedSite( state );

	if ( site && site.ID ) {
		return site.ID;
	}
	return null;
};
=======
export const getHelpSelectedSite = state => {
	const siteId = getHelpSiteId( state ) || getSelectedOrPrimarySiteId( state );
	
	// If we don't have a valid siteId, return null early
	if (!siteId) {
		return null;
	}

	return getSite( state, siteId );
};

export const getHelpSelectedSiteId = state => {
	const site = getHelpSelectedSite( state );

	if ( site && site.ID ) {
		return site.ID;
	}
	return null;
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that we check if `siteId` is valid before trying to get the site. This won't fix the underlying issue in the component that's not handling the null case, but it makes the selector more explicit about the possibility of not having a valid site ID.
