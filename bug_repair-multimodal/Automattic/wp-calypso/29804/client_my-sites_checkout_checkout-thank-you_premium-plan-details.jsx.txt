I'll help you fix the issue with the WordPress.com Premium plan description on the checkout thank you page. Based on the issue description, there are two problems to address:

1. Remove the reference to "no limits" since there is a storage limit
2. Update the storage description to show the total available storage (13GB) rather than saying it "adds 10GB"

Let's locate and fix the bug:

```javascript
### client/my-sites/checkout/checkout-thank-you/premium-plan-details.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
				description={ i18n.translate(
					'Enrich your posts with video and audio, uploaded directly on your site. ' +
						'No ads or limits. The Premium plan also adds 10GB of file storage.'
				) }
=======
				description={ i18n.translate(
					'Enrich your posts with video and audio, uploaded directly on your site. ' +
						'No ads. The WordPress.com Premium plan offers 13GB of file storage.'
				) }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change addresses both issues mentioned in the ticket:
1. Removed "or limits" from the text since there is a storage limit
2. Changed "The Premium plan also adds 10GB of file storage" to "The WordPress.com Premium plan offers 13GB of file storage" to clearly state the total storage available rather than the incremental amount, which avoids confusion for users upgrading from different plans.
