# Bug Analysis

Based on the issue description, the problem is that the app banner is being shown within the WordPress mobile app itself. This is confusing for users since they're already using the app, yet they're seeing a banner encouraging them to open the content in the app.

The bug is in the `AppBanner` component's visibility logic. Currently, it only checks if the user is on a mobile device, but it doesn't check if the user is already using the mobile app.

## Solution

We need to modify the `isVisible()` method in the `AppBanner` component to also check if the user is already using the WordPress mobile app. We can detect this by checking the user agent string for specific patterns that would indicate the WordPress app.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	isVisible() {
		const { dismissedUntil, currentSection } = this.props;

		return this.isMobile() && ! isDismissed( dismissedUntil, currentSection );
	}
=======
	isVisible() {
		const { dismissedUntil, currentSection, userAgent } = this.props;
		
		// Don't show the app banner if we're already in the WordPress app
		if ( userAgent.indexOf( 'wp-android' ) > -1 || userAgent.indexOf( 'wp-iphone' ) > -1 ) {
			return false;
		}

		return this.isMobile() && ! isDismissed( dismissedUntil, currentSection );
	}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change checks the user agent string for indicators that the user is already using the WordPress mobile app. The WordPress Android app includes "wp-android" in its user agent, and the iOS app includes "wp-iphone". If either of these strings is found, the banner will not be displayed.
