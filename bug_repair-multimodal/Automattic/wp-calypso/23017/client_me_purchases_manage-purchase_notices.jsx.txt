I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the problem with Jetpack monthly plans showing error messages about expiring in a month.

## Bug Localization

The issue is that monthly plans are showing up with error notices that cause anxiety for users, when there's nothing actually wrong. Looking at the code, I can see that in the `renderPurchaseExpiringNotice()` method, monthly plans are treated the same as other plans when it comes to displaying expiration notices.

The specific problem is in the `getExpiringText()` method where there's a bug in the text for monthly plans:

1. The message format for monthly plans has a grammatical error: "will expire and be removed from your site %(expiry)s days" (missing "in")
2. The notice status is set to "is-error" for plans expiring within 90 days, which is too severe for monthly plans that are designed to expire and renew monthly

## Fix

I'll make the following changes:
1. Fix the grammatical error in the monthly plan message
2. Modify the `renderPurchaseExpiringNotice()` method to use a less severe notice status for monthly plans

```javascript
### client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/notices.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		if ( isMonthly( purchase.productSlug ) ) {
			const expiryMoment = moment( purchase.expiryMoment );
			const daysToExpiry = moment( expiryMoment.diff( moment() ) ).format( 'D' );

			return translate(
				'%(purchaseName)s will expire and be removed from your site %(expiry)s days. ',
				{
					args: {
						purchaseName: getName( purchase ),
						expiry: daysToExpiry,
					},
				}
			);
		}
=======
		if ( isMonthly( purchase.productSlug ) ) {
			const expiryMoment = moment( purchase.expiryMoment );
			const daysToExpiry = moment( expiryMoment.diff( moment() ) ).format( 'D' );

			return translate(
				'%(purchaseName)s will renew in %(expiry)s days. ',
				{
					args: {
						purchaseName: getName( purchase ),
						expiry: daysToExpiry,
					},
				}
			);
		}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```javascript
### client/me/purchases/manage-purchase/notices.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
		let noticeStatus = 'is-info';
		if ( ! isExpiring( purchase ) ) {
			return null;
		}

		if ( purchase.expiryMoment < moment().add( 90, 'days' ) ) {
			noticeStatus = 'is-error';
		}
=======
		let noticeStatus = 'is-info';
		if ( ! isExpiring( purchase ) ) {
			return null;
		}

		if ( isMonthly( purchase.productSlug ) ) {
			// Monthly plans are expected to renew every month, so we always use info status
			noticeStatus = 'is-info';
		} else if ( purchase.expiryMoment < moment().add( 90, 'days' ) ) {
			noticeStatus = 'is-error';
		}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will:
1. Change the message for monthly plans from suggesting something is wrong ("will expire and be removed") to a neutral informational message ("will renew in X days")
2. Ensure monthly plans always show with the less severe "is-info" status instead of the alarming "is-error" status

This addresses the issue by reducing the severity of the notice for monthly plans and making the message more appropriate for a subscription that's designed to renew monthly.
