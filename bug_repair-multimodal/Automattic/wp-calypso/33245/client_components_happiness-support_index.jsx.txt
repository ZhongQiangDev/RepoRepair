I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Localization

The issue is that the "Priority support" card has a different layout compared to other cards on the plans page. Specifically, the icon/illustration is on the right and the content is on the left, while all other cards have the icon on the left and content on the right.

Looking at the code, the issue is in the `render()` method of the `HappinessSupport` component. The component renders the illustration first, followed by the heading, text, and buttons. This causes the illustration to appear on the left side of the card.

## Fix

We need to rearrange the order of elements in the `render()` method to match the layout of other cards. The illustration should be rendered after the content (heading, text, and buttons).

```javascript
### client/components/happiness-support/index.jsx
<<<<<<< SEARCH
	render() {
		const classes = {
			'is-placeholder': this.props.isPlaceholder,
		};

		return (
			<div className={ classNames( 'happiness-support', classes ) }>
				{ this.renderIllustration() }

				<h3 className="happiness-support__heading">{ this.getHeadingText() }</h3>

				<p className="happiness-support__text">{ this.getSupportText() }</p>

				{ this.getSupportButtons() }
			</div>
		);
	}
=======
	render() {
		const classes = {
			'is-placeholder': this.props.isPlaceholder,
		};

		return (
			<div className={ classNames( 'happiness-support', classes ) }>
				<h3 className="happiness-support__heading">{ this.getHeadingText() }</h3>

				<p className="happiness-support__text">{ this.getSupportText() }</p>

				{ this.getSupportButtons() }
				
				{ this.renderIllustration() }
			</div>
		);
	}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change moves the illustration to be rendered after the content (heading, text, and buttons), which will make the "Priority support" card layout consistent with the other cards on the page, with the icon on the right and content on the left.
