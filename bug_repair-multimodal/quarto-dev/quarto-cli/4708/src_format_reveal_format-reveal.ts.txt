I've analyzed the issue and found the bug. The problem occurs when `hash-type: number` is used in the RevealJS format. Looking at the issue description and screenshots, it appears that the title slide loses its alignment when this option is used.

The issue is in the `format-reveal.ts` file. When `hash-type: number` is set, the code removes the ID from the title slide, but it doesn't properly handle the centering of the title slide. The title slide should remain centered regardless of the hash-type setting.

Here's the fix:

```typescript
### src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    // if we are using 'number' as our hash type then remove the
    // title slide id
    if (format.metadata[kHashType] === "number") {
      const titleSlide = doc.getElementById("title-slide");
      if (titleSlide) {
        titleSlide.removeAttribute("id");
      }
    }
=======
    // if we are using 'number' as our hash type then remove the
    // title slide id but preserve its centering
    if (format.metadata[kHashType] === "number") {
      const titleSlide = doc.getElementById("title-slide");
      if (titleSlide) {
        // Store the class list before removing the ID
        const hasCenter = titleSlide.classList.contains("center");
        titleSlide.removeAttribute("id");
        // Ensure the center class is preserved if it was there
        if (hasCenter) {
          titleSlide.classList.add("center");
        }
      }
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when we remove the ID from the title slide (which is necessary for the `hash-type: number` functionality), we preserve the centering of the slide by checking if it has the "center" class and re-adding it if needed. This will maintain the proper alignment of the title slide regardless of the hash-type setting.
