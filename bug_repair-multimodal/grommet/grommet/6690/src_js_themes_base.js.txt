I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is about color contrast violation in Form/AggregateValidation where the "status-error" color is mentioned. Looking at the code, I can see that the status colors are defined in the `statusColors` object in the base.js file. The current error color (#FF4040) appears to have insufficient contrast for accessibility standards.

Let's fix this by updating the error color to a darker shade that will provide better contrast:

```javascript
### src/js/themes/base.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const statusColors = {
  critical: '#FF4040',
  error: '#FF4040',
  warning: '#FFAA15',
  ok: '#00C781',
  unknown: '#CCCCCC',
  disabled: '#CCCCCC',
};
=======
const statusColors = {
  critical: '#FF4040',
  error: '#E01E5A', // Darker red with better contrast
  warning: '#FFAA15',
  ok: '#00C781',
  unknown: '#CCCCCC',
  disabled: '#CCCCCC',
};
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces the error color with a darker red (#E01E5A) that should provide better contrast while still maintaining the "error" visual semantics. This color is commonly used in design systems for error states and has better accessibility characteristics.
