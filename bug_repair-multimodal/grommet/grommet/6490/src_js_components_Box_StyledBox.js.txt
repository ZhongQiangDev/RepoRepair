I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, the Box component breaks when using both `border="between"` and a gap size in pixels (like `gap="10px"`). The error message indicates that there's a problem with trying to read a `match` property of an undefined value.

Looking at the code, the issue is likely in the `gapStyle` function where it handles the border between elements. The problem occurs when parsing the metric value for a pixel-based gap.

Let's examine the `parseMetricToNum` function usage in the `gapStyle` function. When a pixel value like "10px" is passed, the code tries to calculate border offsets, but it seems the parsing is failing.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    const borderOffset = `${
      parseMetricToNum(metric) / 2 - parseMetricToNum(borderMetric) / 2
    }px`;
    const responsiveBorderMetric =
      responsive &&
      breakpoint &&
      (breakpoint.borderSize[borderSize] || borderSize);
    const responsiveBorderOffset =
      responsiveBorderMetric &&
      `${
        parseMetricToNum(responsiveMetric) / 2 -
        parseMetricToNum(responsiveBorderMetric) / 2
      }px`;
=======
    const borderOffset = `${
      parseMetricToNum(metric || '0px') / 2 - parseMetricToNum(borderMetric || '0px') / 2
    }px`;
    const responsiveBorderMetric =
      responsive &&
      breakpoint &&
      (breakpoint.borderSize[borderSize] || borderSize);
    const responsiveBorderOffset =
      responsiveBorderMetric && responsiveMetric &&
      `${
        parseMetricToNum(responsiveMetric || '0px') / 2 -
        parseMetricToNum(responsiveBorderMetric || '0px') / 2
      }px`;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds null checks to ensure that when `parseMetricToNum` is called, it always has a value to work with, even if the original values are undefined. The default '0px' ensures that the function has a valid string to parse, preventing the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')" error.
