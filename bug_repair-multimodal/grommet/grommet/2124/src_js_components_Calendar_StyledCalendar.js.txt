I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix for the Calendar component that's broken in IE11.

Looking at the issue, the Calendar component is not displaying properly in IE11. The screenshot shows that the calendar days are not properly aligned or displayed. 

The problem appears to be in the `StyledWeek` component in `StyledCalendar.js`. The CSS property `flex-justify: between` is not a valid CSS property. The correct property should be `justify-content: space-between`. This is likely causing the layout issues in IE11, which is less forgiving of CSS errors than modern browsers.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export const StyledWeek = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-justify: between;
`;
=======
export const StyledWeek = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
`;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change replaces the invalid `flex-justify: between` property with the correct `justify-content: space-between` property, which should fix the layout issues in IE11. The `justify-content` property is the standard way to control the alignment of flex items along the main axis in a flex container.
