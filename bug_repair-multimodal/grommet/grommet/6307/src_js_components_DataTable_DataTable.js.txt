I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when using browser navigation (back/forward buttons), the sorting arrow icon in the DataTable header doesn't update to reflect the sorting parameters stored in the URL. 

Looking at the code, I can see that the DataTable component initializes the sort state from the `sortProp` prop, but it doesn't update this state when the `sortProp` changes after the initial render. This is why the arrows don't update when navigating with browser buttons - the URL changes, but the component doesn't react to the new sort parameters.

## Solution

We need to add a `useEffect` hook that updates the internal `sort` state whenever the `sortProp` changes. This will ensure that when navigation occurs and the parent component passes a new `sortProp` value, the DataTable will update its UI accordingly.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
  // which column we are sorting on, with direction
  const [sort, setSort] = useState(sortProp || {});

  // the data filtered and sorted, if needed
=======
  // which column we are sorting on, with direction
  const [sort, setSort] = useState(sortProp || {});

  // Update sort when sortProp changes (e.g., from URL changes during navigation)
  useEffect(() => {
    if (sortProp) {
      setSort(sortProp);
    }
  }, [sortProp]);

  // the data filtered and sorted, if needed
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a `useEffect` hook that watches for changes to the `sortProp` prop. When `sortProp` changes (which would happen when the URL changes during browser navigation), it updates the internal `sort` state, which will then cause the header icons to update accordingly.
