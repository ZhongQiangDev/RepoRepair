I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that the Select component's dropdown arrow is not visible on a dark background. Looking at the code, I can see that the arrow icon is being rendered with a fixed color:

```javascript
<SelectIcon color='brand' size={size} />
```

The problem is that the arrow is always set to the 'brand' color, which might not be visible on dark backgrounds. We need to modify this to use a color that will be visible regardless of the background.

Here's the fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Select/Select.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
              <SelectIcon color='brand' size={size} />
=======
              <SelectIcon color={theme.select.icons.color || 'brand'} size={size} />
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change allows the theme to specify the icon color through `theme.select.icons.color`, falling back to 'brand' if not specified. This way, the theme can provide appropriate contrast for different backgrounds.

The issue occurs because the arrow icon is always rendered with the 'brand' color, which might not have enough contrast on dark backgrounds. By using a theme-provided color, we can ensure the arrow is visible regardless of the background color.
