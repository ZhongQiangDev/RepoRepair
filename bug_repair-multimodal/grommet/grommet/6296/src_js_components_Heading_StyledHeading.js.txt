I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

The issue is that long headings in PageHeader are overflowing instead of wrapping to the next line. Looking at the code, I can see that the `StyledHeading` component is missing proper styling to handle text wrapping.

The problem is in the `StyledHeading.js` file. The component needs to have proper word-wrapping styles to prevent overflow. Currently, the `StyledHeading` component is defined but doesn't include the necessary styles to handle text wrapping.

Here's my fix:

```javascript
### src/js/components/Heading/StyledHeading.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
const StyledHeading = styled.h1`
  ${genericStyles}






`;
=======
const StyledHeading = styled.h1`
  ${genericStyles}
  ${(props) => sizeStyle(props)}
  ${(props) => props.textAlign && textAlignStyle}
  ${(props) => props.truncate && truncateStyle}
  ${(props) =>
    props.color &&
    colorStyle}
  word-break: break-word;
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
`;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix adds the necessary styles to the `StyledHeading` component:
1. It includes the previously missing style functions (`sizeStyle`, `textAlignStyle`, etc.)
2. Most importantly, it adds `word-break: break-word;` and `overflow-wrap: break-word;` properties which will ensure that long text wraps properly instead of overflowing.

These CSS properties will force the heading text to break and wrap to the next line when it reaches the container's width limit, solving the overflow issue described in the bug report.
