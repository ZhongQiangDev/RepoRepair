I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Issue Analysis

The issue is that when both `action` and `onOrder` properties are used together in the `List` component, the list items become unaligned. Looking at the screenshots:

1. With `onOrder`: The action content is not properly aligned with the rest of the list
2. Without `onOrder`: The action content is properly aligned

The problem is in how the content is structured when both `action` and `onOrder` are present. When `onOrder` is used, the component wraps the content in a `<Box flex>` element, but when `action` is used, it creates a different structure with specific alignment. These two approaches conflict when used together.

## Fix

The issue is in the `List.js` file where the content structure is defined. We need to modify how the content is structured when both `action` and `onOrder` are present:

```javascript
### src/js/components/List/List.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                if (action) {
                  content = [
                    <Box align="start" key={`actionContainer${index}`}>
                      {content}
                    </Box>,
                    action(item, index),
                  ];
                  boxProps = {
                    direction: 'row',
                    align: secondaryKey ? 'start' : 'center',
                    justify: 'between',
                    gap: 'medium',
                  };
                }

                let adjustedBackground =
=======
                if (action) {
                  // If onOrder is also present, we need to handle the content differently
                  // to maintain proper alignment
                  if (onOrder && !isPinned) {
                    // When onOrder is present, content is already wrapped in a Box flex
                    // so we need to structure the action differently
                    content = [
                      content,
                      action(item, index),
                    ];
                    boxProps = {
                      ...boxProps,
                      justify: 'between',
                    };
                  } else {
                    content = [
                      <Box align="start" key={`actionContainer${index}`}>
                        {content}
                      </Box>,
                      action(item, index),
                    ];
                    boxProps = {
                      direction: 'row',
                      align: secondaryKey ? 'start' : 'center',
                      justify: 'between',
                      gap: 'medium',
                    };
                  }
                }

                let adjustedBackground =
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This fix ensures that when both `action` and `onOrder` are present, the content structure is properly handled to maintain alignment. The key change is detecting when both properties are used and adjusting the content structure accordingly.
