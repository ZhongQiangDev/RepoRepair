I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

Based on the issue description, there's a mismatch between the documentation and the actual type definition for the `SourceObject` type in the React PDF library. The documentation states that an Image source object can be a function that returns a string or a Promise of a string, but the type definition doesn't include this possibility.

The issue is in the type definition file `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts`. We need to update the `SourceObject` type to include a function that returns a string or a Promise of a string.

```typescript
### @react-pdf/types/image.d.ts
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export type SourceObject =
  | string
  | { data: Buffer; format: 'png' | 'jpg' }
  | { uri: string; method: HTTPMethod; body: any; headers: any }
=======
export type SourceObject =
  | string
  | { data: Buffer; format: 'png' | 'jpg' }
  | { uri: string; method: HTTPMethod; body: any; headers: any }
  | (() => string | Promise<string>)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the function type to the `SourceObject` union type, allowing users to provide a function that returns either a string or a Promise of a string as the image source, which matches the documentation and fixes the compilation error shown in the issue.
