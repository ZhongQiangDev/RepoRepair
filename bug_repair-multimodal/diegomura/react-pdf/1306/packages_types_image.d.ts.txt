I'll analyze the issue and provide a fix.

## Bug Analysis

The issue is that the `SourceObject` type definition in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` doesn't support a function that returns a string or Promise<string>, which is mentioned in the documentation. 

According to the issue, the documentation states that an Image source object can be a function that returns a string or a promise of a string: `() => String | Promise<String>`. However, the current type definition doesn't include this option, causing compilation errors when users try to use a function that returns a Promise<string> as the image source.

## Fix

I'll update the `SourceObject` type definition to include the missing function type:

```typescript
### packages/types/image.d.ts
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export type SourceObject =
  | string
  | { data: Buffer; format: 'png' | 'jpg' }
  | { uri: string; method: HTTPMethod; body: any; headers: any };
=======
export type SourceObject =
  | string
  | { data: Buffer; format: 'png' | 'jpg' }
  | { uri: string; method: HTTPMethod; body: any; headers: any }
  | (() => string | Promise<string>);
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the function type `(() => string | Promise<string>)` as a valid option for the `SourceObject` type, which will allow users to use functions that return either a string or a Promise<string> as image sources, matching the documented behavior.
