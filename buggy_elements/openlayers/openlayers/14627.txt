### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that when an empty extent is transformed using `applyTransform`, it results in an extent with `NaN` values. This `NaN` extent is then passed to `map.getView().fit`, which throws an error because it cannot handle `NaN` values.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `fromEPSG4326` function, which is used to transform coordinates from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857, encounters an input extent with `Infinity` values. When it attempts to compute the `y` value using the formula `RADIUS * Math.log(Math.tan((Math.PI * (lat + 90)) / 360))`, it results in `NaN` because `Math.tan` of `Infinity` is `NaN`. This `NaN` value propagates through the transformation process, leading to an extent with `NaN` values.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/extent.js`

```
src/ol/extent.js
function: applyTransform
function: createEmpty
```

The `applyTransform` function is directly involved in the issue because it applies the transformation function to the extent. The `createEmpty` function is relevant because it creates an extent with `Infinity` values, which leads to the `NaN` issue when transformed.

#### `src/ol/proj.js`

```
src/ol/proj.js
function: getTransform
function: transformExtent
function: fromEPSG4326
```

The `getTransform` function is used to obtain the transformation function between projections. The `transformExtent` function applies the transformation to an extent. The `fromEPSG4326` function is the specific transformation function that causes the `NaN` issue.

#### `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`

```
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
function: fromEPSG4326
```

This file contains the `fromEPSG4326` function, which is the specific function that causes the `NaN` issue when transforming coordinates from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857.

#### `src/ol/transform.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to general transformations and do not directly handle the specific issue with `Infinity` values in extents.

#### `src/ol/geom/flat/transform.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to transformations of flat coordinates and do not directly handle the specific issue with `Infinity` values in extents.
