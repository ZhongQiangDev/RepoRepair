### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the image layer renderer is creating a canvas with a size based on the display pixel ratio instead of the image ratio of the source. This results in the canvas being unnecessarily large on HiDPI devices, leading to excessive memory usage.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the renderer not correctly accounting for the pixel ratio of the image source when determining the canvas size. Instead, it appears to be using the display pixel ratio, which can be higher on HiDPI devices, leading to a canvas that is larger than necessary.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/layer/BaseImage.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas.js`
```
src/ol/render/canvas.js
function: drawImage
function: function_10
```
The `drawImage` and `function_10` functions are responsible for drawing images onto a canvas context. They handle the scaling and transformation of images, which could be relevant to the issue of canvas size and memory usage.

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js`
```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js
class: CanvasImageLayerRenderer
```
The `CanvasImageLayerRenderer` class is responsible for rendering image layers onto a canvas. It includes methods like `prepareFrame` and `renderFrame`, which determine the image to display and perform the actual rendering. These methods could be involved in determining the canvas size and applying transformations.

#### `src/ol/source/ImageCanvas.js`
```
src/ol/source/ImageCanvas.js
class: ImageCanvasSource
```
The `ImageCanvasSource` class manages image sources represented by canvas elements. The `getImageInternal` method calculates the canvas size based on the extent, resolution, and pixel ratio. This method could be responsible for the incorrect canvas size calculation.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
