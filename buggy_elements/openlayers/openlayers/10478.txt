### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when zooming in and out on a map with a reprojected Tile layer, white areas appear. This indicates that certain tiles are not being rendered correctly during the reprojection process, leading to gaps in the map display.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the disposal of underlying Tile objects. When a Tile object is disposed, it is excluded from the stitching process used to create the source canvas for the reprojection. This results in white areas where the tiles should be displayed. The problem suggests that either the tiles should not be disposed of, or there should be a mechanism to refetch them when needed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/layer/Tile.js
```
src/ol/layer/Tile.js
class: TileLayer
```
The `TileLayer` class is responsible for handling tiled image layers. While it does not directly handle reprojection, it is involved in the lifecycle of tiles and could be relevant if there are issues with tile disposal or refetching.

#### src/ol/proj/projections.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with projection caching and does not directly relate to tile reprojection or disposal.

#### src/ol/proj/transforms.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with coordinate transformations and does not directly relate to tile reprojection or disposal.

#### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
```
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
class: ReprojTile
```
The `ReprojTile` class is directly involved in the reprojection of tiles. It manages the reprojection process, including loading source tiles and rendering the reprojected image. This class is likely where the issue lies, as it handles the disposal and re-fetching of tiles.

#### src/ol/source/Tile.js
```
src/ol/source/Tile.js
class: TileSource
```
The `TileSource` class manages the configuration and caching of tiles. It includes methods for handling tile expiration and loading status, which could be relevant if tiles are being disposed of prematurely.

#### src/ol/source/UrlTile.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with fetching tiles over HTTP and does not directly relate to tile reprojection or disposal.

#### src/ol/structs/LRUCache.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with a least-recently-used cache and does not directly relate to tile reprojection or disposal.

#### src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with tile grid management and does not directly relate to tile reprojection or disposal.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the following locations are relevant to the issue:

```
src/ol/layer/Tile.js
class: TileLayer

src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
class: ReprojTile

src/ol/source/Tile.js
class: TileSource
```
