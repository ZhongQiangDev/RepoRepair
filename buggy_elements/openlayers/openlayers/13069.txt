### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the current implementation does not utilize the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values from the GeoTIFF metadata for normalization. Instead, it relies on user-provided `min` and `max` values for the color scale. The desired behavior is to use the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values as default `max` and `min` values for normalization if they are present in the GeoTIFF metadata.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the current code does not check for the presence of `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` in the GeoTIFF metadata and does not use these values as defaults for normalization. The `getVariables` function in `examples/cog-colors.js` currently relies on `minValueInput` and `maxValueInput` for the `min` and `max` values, which are likely user-provided. The `getGDALMetadata` method in `geotiff.js` can provide the necessary metadata, but this information is not being utilized in the normalization process.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### examples/cog-colors.js
```
examples/cog-colors.js
function: getVariables
```
The `getVariables` function is relevant because it currently sets the `min` and `max` values for normalization based on user input (`minValueInput` and `maxValueInput`). This function needs to be modified to check for `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` from the GeoTIFF metadata and use them as defaults if available.

#### src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
```
The `GeoTIFFSource` class is relevant because it handles the GeoTIFF data and could be responsible for extracting the metadata. The class may need to be modified to pass the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values to the normalization process.

#### src/ol/format/Feature.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file does not contain any functions or classes directly related to the normalization process or GeoTIFF metadata handling.

#### src/ol/geom/flat/closest.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains functions related to geometric calculations and does not handle GeoTIFF metadata or normalization.

#### src/ol/geom/flat/simplify.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains functions related to geometric simplification and does not handle GeoTIFF metadata or normalization.
