### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description suggests that the current implementation does not support an `auto` option for the `convertToRGB` parameter when dealing with GeoTIFF sources. Specifically, if a GeoTIFF source has 3 samples per pixel and a photometric interpretation like CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab, the `auto` setting should automatically use the `image.readRGB()` method to convert the data to RGB format. This functionality is currently missing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of logic in the GeoTIFF source handling that checks for the `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option and applies the appropriate conversion method (`image.readRGB()`) when the conditions are met. The current implementation may not have the necessary checks or may not be configured to handle this specific case.

The `GeoTIFFSource` class is responsible for handling GeoTIFF data sources, and the functions `getImagesForSource`, `getImagesForTIFF`, `composeTile_`, and `loadTile_` are likely involved in reading and processing the GeoTIFF images. These functions may need to be updated to support the `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option.
