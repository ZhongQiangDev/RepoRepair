### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `TileDebug` layer does not correctly represent the inverted Y coordinate (`{-y}`) for the `TileImage` layer. Specifically, the coordinates in the `TileDebug` layer do not match the coordinates used in the `TileImage` layer when the Y coordinate is inverted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the `TileDebug` layer is not accounting for the inverted Y coordinate (`{-y}`) used in the `TileImage` layer's URL template. The `TileDebug` layer likely uses a standard tile grid configuration that does not consider the inverted Y coordinate, leading to a mismatch between the debug layer and the actual tile layer.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The relevant locations that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

1. `src/ol/source/TileImage.js`
   - `class: TileImage`

2. `src/ol/source/XYZ.js`
   - `class: XYZ`

3. `src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js`
   - `class: TileGrid`

These classes are involved in managing tile coordinates and tile grids, which are crucial for handling the inverted Y coordinate (`{-y}`) correctly.
