### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after drawing a polygon using the `Draw` interaction in OpenLayers 5.3.0, the map becomes undraggable. This issue does not occur in OpenLayers 4.6.5, suggesting a regression in the newer version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to be related to the `Draw` interaction and how it interacts with the map's default interactions, particularly the `DragPan` interaction. When the `Draw` interaction ends, it might be interfering with the `DragPan` interaction, preventing the map from being dragged. The `altKeyOnly` condition might also play a role in this behavior.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- examples/draw-and-modify-features.js ---
```
examples/draw-and-modify-features.js
function: addInteractions
```
This function sets up the `Draw` and `Snap` interactions. It might need to ensure that the `Draw` interaction does not interfere with the `DragPan` interaction after drawing ends.

#### --- examples/draw-features.js ---
```
examples/draw-features.js
function: addInteraction
```
This function also sets up the `Draw` interaction. Similar to `addInteractions`, it might need adjustments to ensure the map remains draggable after drawing.

#### --- src/ol/interaction.js ---
```
src/ol/interaction.js
function: defaults
```
This function initializes default interactions, including `DragPan`. It might need to ensure that the `DragPan` interaction is not disabled or interfered with by other interactions.

#### --- src/ol/Map.js ---
```
src/ol/Map.js
class: Map
```
The `Map` class manages interactions. It might need to ensure that interactions are properly managed and do not interfere with each other.

#### --- src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js ---
```
src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js
class: DragPan
```
The `DragPan` interaction might need to be checked to ensure it remains active and functional after the `Draw` interaction ends.

#### --- src/ol/interaction/Draw.js ---
```
src/ol/interaction/Draw.js
class: Draw
```
The `Draw` interaction might need to be checked to ensure it does not interfere with other interactions, particularly `DragPan`, after drawing ends.

#### --- src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/ol/pointer/PointerEventHandler.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
