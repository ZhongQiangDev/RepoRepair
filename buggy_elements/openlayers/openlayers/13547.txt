### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the current implementation of the gutter option is only supported by `TileWMS`, but other tile sources like `XYZ` and `DataTile` do not support it. This limitation causes edge effects when interpolating tiles from these sources, as seen in the provided image. Additionally, the current handling of the gutter for WebGL tile layers is inadequate, as the gutter is removed before creating the texture, which does not prevent edge effects.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the gutter option is not implemented for tile sources other than `TileWMS`. The `TileWMS` class has a `gutter_` attribute and a `tileUrlFunction` that adjusts the tile extent based on the gutter size. However, other tile sources like `XYZ` and `DataTile` lack similar functionality. Furthermore, the WebGL tile texture handling does not account for the gutter, leading to edge effects when rendering.
