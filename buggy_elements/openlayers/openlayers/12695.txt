### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the point symbols in the KML layer are not aligned correctly. Specifically:

- The symbols appear to be anchored at the center-bottom instead of the center.
- The symbols are displayed at a larger size compared to how they are shown in Google Earth.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior likely involves issues with the anchor point and scaling of the symbols when they are rendered in OpenLayers. The anchor point determines where the symbol is positioned relative to the geographic point it represents, and the scaling affects the size of the symbol.

### Explanation

- **src/ol/format/KML.js**: This file contains functions that handle the parsing and styling of KML data. The `createFeatureStyleFunction` and `createNameStyleFunction` functions are responsible for determining the style of features, including the anchor point and text alignment. The `iconStyleParser`, `readIcon`, and `writeIconStyle` functions handle the parsing and writing of icon styles, which could affect the anchor point and size of the symbols.
  
- **src/ol/style/Icon.js**: The `Icon` class and the `calculateScale` function are relevant because they manage the visual representation of icons, including their size and anchor point. The `Icon` class contains properties like `anchor_`, `normalizedAnchor_`, and `scale`, which directly affect how the symbols are rendered. The `calculateScale` function determines the scaling factor for the icons, which could be responsible for the size discrepancy.

These functions and classes are likely the ones that need to be inspected and potentially edited to fix the alignment and size issues with the KML symbols.
