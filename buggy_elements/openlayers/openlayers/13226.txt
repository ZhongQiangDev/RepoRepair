### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that sources which use view projection with `wrapX` set to `false` do not work correctly with the `WebGLTileLayer`. Specifically, the WebGL renderer incorrectly expects the source to have a tile grid, leading to rendering issues when `ol/layer/Tile` is replaced with `ol/layer/WebGLTile`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the WebGLTileLayer's assumption that the source has a tile grid, which may not be the case when `wrapX` is `false`. This assumption could be causing the WebGL renderer to fail in correctly rendering the tiles. The problem might be related to how the WebGLTileLayer handles tile coordinates and projections when `wrapX` is disabled.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
function: parseStyle
```
The `WebGLTileLayer` class and the `parseStyle` function are relevant because they handle the WebGL rendering and style configuration, which may need adjustments to correctly handle sources with `wrapX` set to `false`.

#### src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions and classes in this file are related to coordinate transformations and projections, which are not directly involved in the WebGL rendering process or the handling of tile grids.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
function: getRenderExtent
function: depthForZ
function: addTileTextureToLookup
```
The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class and the `getRenderExtent`, `depthForZ`, and `addTileTextureToLookup` functions are relevant because they manage the rendering process, depth calculations, and tile texture management, which may need to be adjusted to handle sources with `wrapX` set to `false`.

#### src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `ReprojTile` class is related to reprojection of tiles, which is not directly relevant to the issue described.

#### src/ol/source/Tile.js
```
src/ol/source/Tile.js
class: TileSource
```
The `TileSource` class is relevant because it manages the configuration and caching of tiles, which may need adjustments to handle sources with `wrapX` set to `false`.
