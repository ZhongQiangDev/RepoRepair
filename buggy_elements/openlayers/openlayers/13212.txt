### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the WebGL context is lost when dealing with larger pyramids of WebGLTileLayers. This results in not-rendered tiles and poor performance (2-5 FPS instead of the expected 30 FPS). The issue is attributed to the limitations of WebGL contexts when handling a large number of layers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely due to the following factors:
- **Excessive WebGL Contexts**: With a large pyramid of WebGLTileLayers, each layer may be creating its own WebGL context, leading to a high number of contexts that exceed the browser's capacity.
- **Performance Bottleneck**: Managing and rendering a large number of layers simultaneously can overwhelm the GPU and CPU, resulting in poor performance and context loss.
- **Memory Management**: The current implementation may not be efficiently managing memory, leading to context loss due to memory constraints.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### examples/cog-pyramid.js

```
examples/cog-pyramid.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: useLayer
```

**Explanation**: 
- `function_1` constructs URLs for GeoTIFF images and creates `GeoTIFF` objects. This function is relevant as it deals with the source of the tiles.
- `function_2` manages the map's 'moveend' event and iterates over tile coordinates, which is relevant to the rendering process.
- `useLayer` creates `WebGLTileLayer` instances for each tile, which is directly related to the issue of excessive WebGL contexts.

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `WebGLTileLayer` class is directly responsible for creating and managing WebGL layers. The issue of excessive WebGL contexts is likely tied to how this class is used and configured.

#### src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `GeoTIFFSource` class handles GeoTIFF data sources. While it is not directly responsible for the WebGL context issue, it is relevant as it provides the source data for the tiles.

#### src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `TileGrid` class manages tile grids but does not directly relate to the WebGL context management or performance issues described.

#### src/ol/webgl/Helper.js

```
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
class: WebGLHelper
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `WebGLHelper` class manages WebGL rendering, including shader compilation, buffer management, and post-processing. It is relevant as it handles the WebGL context and rendering pipeline.
