### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `ol.layer.WebGLTile` layer does not render data loaded with `ol.source.DataTile` using a custom tile grid. The issue is indicated by black tiles appearing instead of the expected data. Additionally, a WebGL warning is logged, indicating that there is a mismatch between the expected and available data for texture upload.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the texture upload process in WebGL. The warning message suggests that the WebGL texture upload is expecting more data than is available, specifically more rows and pixels than are provided. This could be due to a mismatch between the tile size specified in the tile grid and the actual size of the data being uploaded.
