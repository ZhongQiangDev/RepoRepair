### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is the inconsistency in the rendering tests. Currently, there are two different approaches for testing the rendering output: one in the `rendering` directory and another in the `test/rendering` directory. This split approach leads to redundancy and potential inconsistencies in the testing process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the lack of a unified testing strategy for rendering. Having tests split across two directories (`rendering` and `test/rendering`) suggests that the tests were likely developed independently or at different times, leading to a divergence in testing methodologies. This can result in duplicated effort, inconsistent test coverage, and potential maintenance issues.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the rendering tests mentioned in the GitHub problem description. The issue described is related to the organization and structure of the test files themselves, rather than the functionality of the code within the provided files. Therefore, the relevant files to inspect or edit would be those located in the `rendering` and `test/rendering` directories, which are not included in the provided list of relevant files.
