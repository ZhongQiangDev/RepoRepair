### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the WMS image appears blurry when the ratio is not a round integer or when the map width or height is not even. This suggests that the image is not being rendered at the correct resolution or size, leading to a loss of sharpness.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The blurriness likely stems from incorrect handling of the image size or resolution during rendering. Specifically, the issue could be related to how the image size is calculated or scaled, particularly when dealing with non-integer ratios or uneven dimensions. This might involve improper rounding, scaling, or transformation of the image dimensions.

```
The `ImageWMS` class is responsible for handling WMS requests and rendering images. The issue could be related to how the image size (`imageSize_`) or the ratio (`ratio_`) is calculated and applied during rendering.

#### src/ol/source/TileImage.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
