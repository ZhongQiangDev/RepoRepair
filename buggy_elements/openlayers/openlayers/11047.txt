### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the raster source creates web workers using `pixelworks`, but these workers are never terminated. This leads to high memory usage and potential memory leaks, as the workers continue to consume resources even when they are no longer needed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the lack of proper termination of web workers created by the `RasterSource`. When the raster source is no longer needed or when the application state changes, the workers should be terminated to free up memory. However, this is not happening, leading to a memory leak.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/source/Raster.js

```
src/ol/source/Raster.js
class: RasterSource
function: createWorker
function: createFauxWorker
```

- **RasterSource**: This class is responsible for managing the raster operation and the workers used for processing. It contains attributes like `worker_` which holds the processor responsible for executing the raster operation. The issue might be related to how this class manages and terminates the workers.
- **createWorker**: This function dynamically generates a web worker. It is crucial to ensure that these workers are properly terminated when they are no longer needed.
- **createFauxWorker**: This function simulates a web worker. It includes a `terminate` method, which should be called to stop the worker. Ensuring this method is called correctly could help resolve the memory leak.

### Summary

The primary issue appears to be related to the `RasterSource` class and the `createWorker` and `createFauxWorker` functions in `src/ol/source/Raster.js`. These components are responsible for creating and managing web workers, and ensuring they are properly terminated is crucial for preventing memory leaks.
