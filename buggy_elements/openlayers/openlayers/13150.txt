### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `opacity` option in `ol/layer/Heatmap` is being ignored. When the `opacity` is set to a value like `0.1`, it has no visual effect on the heatmap layer, whereas it should reduce the layer's transparency as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the `opacity` setting is not being correctly applied to the WebGL rendering process for the heatmap layer. This could be due to several reasons:
- The `opacity` value is not being passed correctly to the WebGL rendering pipeline.
- The shaders used for rendering the heatmap do not incorporate the `opacity` value.
- There might be a problem with how the heatmap layer interacts with the WebGLHelper or WebGLPointsLayerRenderer classes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
```
src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
class: Heatmap
```
The Heatmap class is directly responsible for managing the heatmap layer. It should handle the `opacity` property and ensure it is passed to the WebGL rendering pipeline. The issue might be in how the `opacity` is set or passed to the WebGL renderer.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js
```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/PointsLayer.js
class: WebGLPointsLayerRenderer
```
The WebGLPointsLayerRenderer class is responsible for rendering points using WebGL. Since the heatmap layer uses WebGL for rendering, this class might be involved in the rendering process. The issue could be in how the `opacity` is handled in the shaders or the rendering pipeline.

#### src/ol/style/Image.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The ImageStyle class is related to image-based symbols and does not directly affect the heatmap layer's opacity.

#### src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to WebGL helper utilities and do not directly affect the heatmap layer's opacity.

#### src/ol/webgl/ShaderBuilder.js
```
src/ol/webgl/ShaderBuilder.js
class: ShaderBuilder
```
The ShaderBuilder class is responsible for creating shaders. If the shaders used for rendering the heatmap do not incorporate the `opacity` value, this class might be involved. The issue could be in how the `opacity` is added to the shader expressions.
