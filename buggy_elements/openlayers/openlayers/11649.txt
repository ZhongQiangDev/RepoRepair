### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when using proj4js definitions with OpenLayers, the resulting projection is invalid. Specifically:

- Required parameters like `units` are undefined.
- The `axisOrientation` is set to a wrong default value ("enu" instead of "neu").
- The map display/projection is broken when using the ol.Projection.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior appears to be related to how OpenLayers handles proj4js definitions when they are registered. The issue seems to stem from the fact that proj4js definitions for geographic CRS (like EPSG:4258) do not explicitly define units, and OpenLayers does not handle this case correctly. As a result, the `units` property is left undefined, and the `axisOrientation` defaults to "enu" instead of the correct "neu".

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/proj/proj4.js`
```
src/ol/proj/proj4.js
function: register
```
The `register` function is responsible for synchronizing projection definitions between proj4 and OpenLayers. It appears that this function may not be correctly handling the case where proj4js definitions do not explicitly define units or axis orientation.

#### `src/ol/proj/Projection.js`
```
src/ol/proj/Projection.js
class: Projection
```
The `Projection` class is where the projection properties like `units` and `axisOrientation` are defined. The issue might be related to how these properties are initialized or updated when a new projection is created.

#### `src/ol/proj/transforms.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
