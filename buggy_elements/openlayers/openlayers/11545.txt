### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `className` property is set for an `ol.layer.Heatmap` layer, it does not take effect. Instead, the default `className` is not displayed on the page, indicating that the custom `className` is not being applied correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the `className` property is not being properly handled or applied within the `Heatmap` layer class. This could be due to a few reasons:
- The `className` property might not be correctly passed down to the underlying rendering mechanism.
- The `className` might not be set as a property on the DOM element that represents the heatmap layer.
- There might be an issue with how the `className` is being processed within the `Heatmap` class or its parent classes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/layer/Base.js`
This file contains the `BaseLayer` class, which is an abstract class that `Heatmap` extends. The `className_` attribute is defined here, but it is not clear if it is being used or set correctly in the `Heatmap` class.

```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
class: BaseLayer
```

#### `src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js`
This file contains the `Heatmap` class, which is the specific layer type in question. The `className` property should be handled here, but it is not mentioned in the attributes or methods described.

```
src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
class: Heatmap
```

#### `src/ol/layer/Vector.js`
This file contains the `VectorLayer` class, which `Heatmap` extends. The `opt_options` parameter allows setting various properties, but it is not clear if `className` is one of them.

```
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
class: VectorLayer
```

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js`
This file contains the `Executor` class, which is responsible for executing rendering instructions. While it is involved in rendering, it is not directly related to setting the `className` of a layer.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/ol/renderer/Layer.js`
This file contains the `LayerRenderer` class, which is an abstract base class for layer renderers. It does not directly handle the `className` property.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the following locations need inspection or editing to fix the problem:

```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
class: BaseLayer

src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
class: Heatmap

src/ol/layer/Vector.js
class: VectorLayer
```
