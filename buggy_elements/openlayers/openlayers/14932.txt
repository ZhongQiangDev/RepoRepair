### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `textAlign` property values `'start'` and `'end'` are not functioning as expected. Specifically, the texts 'Small text' and 'negative offsetX' are aligned at the wrong end, indicating a regression in the text alignment functionality.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the `textAlign` property is being interpreted or applied within the rendering process. The issue could be due to incorrect handling of the `'start'` and `'end'` values in the text alignment logic, or a problem with the transformation or positioning of the text within the canvas.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `examples/vector-labels-justify-text.js`

```
examples/vector-labels-justify-text.js
function: createStyle
```

The `createStyle` function sets the `textAlign` property for the `Text` object. This function is directly related to the issue since it specifies the alignment properties that are not working as expected.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas.js
function: drawImageOrLabel
function: executeLabelInstructions
function: getTextDimensions
function: measureTextWidth
function: rotateAtOffset
```

- `drawImageOrLabel`: This function handles the drawing of labels, which includes text alignment.
- `executeLabelInstructions`: This function executes drawing instructions for labels, which may include text alignment settings.
- `getTextDimensions`: This function calculates text dimensions, which could affect alignment.
- `measureTextWidth`: This function measures text width, which is relevant for text alignment.
- `rotateAtOffset`: This function handles rotation, which could indirectly affect text alignment if not properly accounted for.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
class: CanvasTextBuilder
```

The `CanvasTextBuilder` class is responsible for rendering text on a canvas and handles various text properties, including alignment. This class is directly relevant to the issue.

#### `src/ol/style/flat.js`

```
src/ol/style/flat.js
function: getText
function: toStyle
```

- `getText`: This function constructs a `Text` object from a flat style object, including the `textAlign` property.
- `toStyle`: This function creates a `Style` instance, which includes text properties like `textAlign`.

#### `src/ol/style/Text.js`

```
src/ol/style/Text.js
class: Text
```

The `Text` class manages text styling properties, including `textAlign`. This class is directly relevant to the issue.
