### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when using `setFill()` in the style of an `ol.layer.VectorTile`, it creates an additional semi-transparent layer on top of the other layers. This additional layer is not expected and causes issues such as flickering on mouse hover.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how the `Fill` style is applied to the `VectorTileLayer`. When a `Fill` style is set, it may be incorrectly rendered or layered on top of other styles, leading to the additional semi-transparent layer. This could be due to a bug in the rendering logic or an issue with how the `Fill` style is handled in the `VectorTileLayer`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/layer/Base.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js`

```
src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
class: VectorTileLayer
```

The `VectorTileLayer` class is directly involved in the creation and rendering of vector tile layers. The issue with the `Fill` style could be related to how the layer is rendered or how styles are applied within this class.

#### `src/ol/render/VectorContext.js`

```
src/ol/render/VectorContext.js
class: VectorContext
```

The `VectorContext` class is responsible for rendering various geometries and applying styles. The issue with the `Fill` style could be related to how the `Fill` style is applied during the rendering process.

#### `src/ol/style/Fill.js`

```
src/ol/style/Fill.js
class: Fill
```

The `Fill` class manages the fill style for vector features. The issue could be related to how the `Fill` class handles the color or how it interacts with other styles.

#### `src/ol/style/Style.js`

```
src/ol/style/Style.js
class: Style
function: createDefaultStyle
function: createEditingStyle
function: defaultGeometryFunction
function: toFunction
```

The `Style` class is a container for vector feature rendering styles and includes methods for setting and getting the fill style. The `createDefaultStyle`, `createEditingStyle`, `defaultGeometryFunction`, and `toFunction` functions could also be relevant if they interact with the `Fill` style in a way that causes the issue.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
   src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
   class: VectorTileLayer
   ```

2. ```
   src/ol/render/VectorContext.js
   class: VectorContext
   ```

3. ```
   src/ol/style/Fill.js
   class: Fill
   ```

4. ```
   src/ol/style/Style.js
   class: Style
   function: createDefaultStyle
   function: createEditingStyle
   function: defaultGeometryFunction
   function: toFunction
   ```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the problem with the `setFill()` function creating an additional semi-transparent layer.
