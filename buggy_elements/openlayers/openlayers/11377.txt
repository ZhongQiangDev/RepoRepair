### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is the degraded performance of the `pointermove` event in version 6.4.0 compared to version 6.3.1. Specifically, the cursor change during operations like zooming and panning is much slower in 6.4.0, affecting the overall responsiveness of the map.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the performance degradation could be related to changes in how the `pointermove` event is handled or how the map updates its state in response to this event. Possible causes include:
- Changes in event handling logic that introduce additional processing steps.
- Modifications in the rendering pipeline that increase the computational load during pointer movements.
- Alterations in the interaction or event propagation mechanisms that affect the responsiveness of the map.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/Map.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js`
```
src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js
class: MapBrowserEventHandler
```
The `MapBrowserEventHandler` class is responsible for managing and handling browser events on the map, including `pointermove`. Changes in this class could directly impact the performance of pointer events.

#### `src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js`
```
src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js
class: DragPan
```
The `DragPan` class handles map panning by dragging, which involves processing `pointermove` events. Issues in this class could affect the responsiveness of panning operations.

#### `src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js`
```
src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js
class: PointerInteraction
function: isPointerDraggingEvent
```
The `PointerInteraction` class and the `isPointerDraggingEvent` function are involved in handling pointer events and determining if an event is part of a dragging sequence. Changes here could influence the performance of pointer-related interactions.

#### `src/ol/layer/Vector.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
