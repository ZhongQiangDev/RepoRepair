### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the current style expressions do not support fetching the `id` of a feature using an expression similar to `['get', 'attributeName']`. This means that while you can access feature properties using `['get', 'attributeName']`, there is no equivalent expression to access the feature's `id` directly, which is typically accessible via `feature.getId()`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the expression system used for style expressions is not designed to handle the `id` property of a feature. The `id` is a special property that is not stored in the `properties` collection of a feature but is instead accessed via a dedicated method `getId()`. Therefore, the expression system needs to be extended to support fetching the `id` in a similar manner to how it fetches other properties.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

function: buildStyle
function: buildText
function: buildIcon
function: buildCircle
function: buildShape
```

The `buildStyle` function and its related functions (`buildText`, `buildIcon`, `buildCircle`, `buildShape`) are responsible for constructing style evaluators from flat style objects. These functions use `buildExpression` to create evaluators for various properties. To support fetching the `id` of a feature, these functions need to be updated to recognize and handle the `id` property.

#### --- src/ol/source/Vector.js ---
```
src/ol/source/Vector.js
class: VectorSource
```

The `VectorSource` class manages vector features and provides methods for accessing feature properties. While it does not directly handle style expressions, it is relevant because it manages the `id` of features. Any changes to the expression system to support fetching the `id` may need to interact with the `VectorSource` class to ensure proper handling of feature `id`s.
