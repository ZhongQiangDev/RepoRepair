### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is the **low performance of the draw interaction** when using `ol.layer.Image` with `renderMode: 'image'` in OpenLayers version 4.6.2 compared to the performance in version 4.4.2. Specifically, the user notes that drawing a triangle is significantly slower in the newer version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the performance issue is likely related to changes in how `ol.layer.Image` with `renderMode: 'image'` handles rendering in OpenLayers 4.6.2. The deprecation of `ol.source.ImageVector` in favor of `ol.layer.Vector` with `renderMode: 'image'` suggests that the rendering pipeline has been altered. This change may have introduced inefficiencies or additional overhead in the rendering process, particularly when dealing with dynamic interactions like drawing.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/interaction.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/renderer/vector.js`
```
src/ol/renderer/vector.js
function: renderFeature
function: renderFeatureInternal
function: renderGeometry
function: renderGeometryCollectionGeometry
function: renderMultiPointGeometry
```

These functions are responsible for rendering features and geometries, which are directly involved in the drawing interaction. Any inefficiencies in these functions could contribute to the performance issue.

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/imagelayer.js`
```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/imagelayer.js
function: function_6
```

The `function_6` method is responsible for preparing a frame for rendering an image layer. This function could be relevant if there are inefficiencies in how the image layer is prepared for rendering.

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js`
```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js
function: function_1
function: function_10
function: function_13
```

These functions handle the rendering of vector layers, including preparing frames and rendering features. They are directly involved in the rendering pipeline and could be contributing to the performance issue.

#### `src/ol/source/imagevector.js`
```
src/ol/source/imagevector.js
function: function_2
function: function_12
function: function_13
```

These functions are related to the deprecated `ol.source.ImageVector` class. While the class is deprecated, the functions may still be relevant if there are differences in how rendering is handled compared to the new `ol.layer.Vector` with `renderMode: 'image'`.

### Summary

The identified functions and classes are likely involved in the performance issue. Further investigation and profiling would be needed to pinpoint the exact cause and implement a fix.
