### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that when the browser is zoomed (e.g., using Ctrl-+), the VectorTile rendering with `renderMode: 'image'` results in clipped tiles. This clipping creates a visible "clip" between tiles, which is not present when the browser is at 100% zoom or when using `renderMode: 'hybrid'`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the tiles are rendered and clipped when the browser's zoom level is not at 100%. When the browser is zoomed, the canvas size and the pixel ratio change, which can affect how the tiles are rendered and clipped. The clipping issue may be related to how the renderer handles the tile boundaries and the pixel ratio when the browser is zoomed.
