### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the WebGLTile layer renderer does not clip the image gutter before creating textures. This results in misplacement and duplication of images when using the WebGLTile layer with a TileWMS source that has a gutter option.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the WebGLTile layer handles the image data when creating textures. Specifically, it seems that the WebGLTile layer renderer does not account for the gutter size when processing the image data, leading to incorrect texture creation. The TileWMS source may be providing images with a gutter, but the WebGLTile layer renderer does not clip this gutter before using the image data for texture creation.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`
   - `class: WebGLTileLayer`

2. `src/ol/source/TileWMS.js`
   - `function: tileUrlFunction`
   - `class: TileWMS`

3. `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js`
   - `function: bindAndConfigure`
   - `function: uploadDataTexture`
   - `function: uploadImageTexture`
   - `class: TileTexture`

These locations are relevant because they involve the WebGLTile layer renderer, the TileWMS source, and the texture creation process, which are all potentially involved in the issue of not clipping the image gutter before creating textures.
