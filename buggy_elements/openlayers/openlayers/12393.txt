### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that a perfectly square image, when scaled to fit a square tile extent, is being stretched unnecessarily due to floating-point rounding errors. This results in the image losing detail because the width is reduced, and the use of `Math.ceil` might be contributing to this issue.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to the scaling and fitting logic within the `ImageStatic` class. Specifically, the use of `Math.ceil` might be causing the image dimensions to be rounded up in a way that leads to unnecessary stretching. The issue could also stem from how the image's dimensions are calculated relative to the tile extent.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The only relevant location identified is:
```
src/ol/source/ImageStatic.js
class: Static
```

This class is directly involved in managing the static image and its scaling to fit within a specified extent. The issue described in the GitHub problem description is likely related to the scaling logic within this class.
