### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue involves the following:

- **Incorrect Shape and Size of Drawn Geometries**: When using the `useGeographic` option, drawn shapes like circles and custom polygons do not maintain their expected shape and size. For example, a circle does not extend to the pointer position as it would in non-geographic mode, and regular polygons are not regular.
- **Issues with `createRegularPolygon` and `createBox`**: These functions produce shapes that are distorted when the view projection is not parallel to WGS84. For instance, a box cannot be drawn correctly in certain projections.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior likely stems from how the coordinates are transformed and how the shapes are constructed in geographic coordinates. When `useGeographic` is enabled, the coordinates are treated as geographic (latitude/longitude) rather than projected coordinates. This can lead to distortions when drawing shapes because the distance between degrees of latitude and longitude varies with latitude. Additionally, the `createRegularPolygon` and `createBox` functions may not account for these distortions, resulting in irregular shapes.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- examples/draw-shapes.js ---
```
examples/draw-shapes.js
function: addInteraction
function: function_3
```
- **`addInteraction`**: This function sets up the drawing interaction and defines the `geometryFunction` for different shapes. It may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly.
- **`function_3`**: This function updates the drawing interaction when the shape type changes. It may need to ensure that the new interaction is set up correctly for geographic coordinates.

#### --- src/ol/proj.js ---
```
src/ol/proj.js
function: createSafeCoordinateTransform
function: transform
function: transformExtent
function: useGeographic
```
- **`createSafeCoordinateTransform`**: This function handles coordinate transformations safely, which may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly.
- **`transform`**: This function transforms coordinates between projections, which may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly.
- **`transformExtent`**: This function transforms extents between projections, which may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly.
- **`useGeographic`**: This function sets the user projection to geographic coordinates, which may need to be adjusted to handle drawing shapes correctly.

#### --- src/ol/geom/SimpleGeometry.js ---
```
src/ol/geom/SimpleGeometry.js
class: SimpleGeometry
```
- **`SimpleGeometry`**: This class handles geometric data and may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly when drawing shapes.

#### --- src/ol/geom/flat/geodesic.js ---
```
src/ol/geom/flat/geodesic.js
function: greatCircleArc
function: line
function: meridian
function: parallel
```
- **`greatCircleArc`**: This function calculates the great-circle path between two points, which may need to be adjusted to handle drawing shapes correctly.
- **`line`**: This function generates a series of flat coordinates by interpolating between two geographic coordinates, which may need to be adjusted to handle drawing shapes correctly.
- **`meridian`**: This function generates a line of constant longitude, which may need to be adjusted to handle drawing shapes correctly.
- **`parallel`**: This function generates a line of constant latitude, which may need to be adjusted to handle drawing shapes correctly.

#### --- src/ol/interaction/Draw.js ---
```
src/ol/interaction/Draw.js
function: createBox
function: createRegularPolygon
class: Draw
```
- **`createBox`**: This function constructs a box-shaped polygon, which may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly.
- **`createRegularPolygon`**: This function constructs a regular polygon, which may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly.
- **`Draw`**: This class handles drawing interactions and may need to be adjusted to handle geographic coordinates correctly when drawing shapes.
