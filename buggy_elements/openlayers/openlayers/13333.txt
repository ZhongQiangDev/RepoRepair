### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described involves WebGLTile layers rendering error images outside their original extent. The images provided show that the rendered tiles extend beyond the intended boundaries, and the extent appears to be incorrect. Additionally, the extent seems to narrow when zooming in, indicating a potential issue with how the extent is calculated or applied during rendering.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be related to how the extent is being calculated or applied to the WebGLTile layer. It might involve incorrect handling of the tile grid, source extent, or the way the WebGLTile layer is configured to render within the specified extent. The problem could also stem from how the GeoTIFF source is being processed and its extent is being determined.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/layer/Layer.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js ---
```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
function: parseStyle
```
The `WebGLTileLayer` class and the `parseStyle` function are relevant because they handle the rendering of WebGLTile layers and the configuration of shaders, which could affect how the tiles are rendered within their extent.

#### --- src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js ---
```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
function: getBoundingBox
function: getImagesForSource
function: getImagesForTIFF
function: getProjection
```
The `GeoTIFFSource` class and the functions `getBoundingBox`, `getImagesForSource`, `getImagesForTIFF`, and `getProjection` are relevant because they handle the loading and processing of GeoTIFF images, which could affect the extent and rendering of the WebGLTile layer.

#### --- src/ol/source/Tile.js ---
```
src/ol/source/Tile.js
class: TileSource
```
The `TileSource` class is relevant because it manages the configuration and caching of tiles, which could affect how the WebGLTile layer is rendered.

#### --- src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js ---
```
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
class: TileGrid
```
The `TileGrid` class is relevant because it manages the tile grid configuration, which could affect how the extent is calculated and applied to the WebGLTile layer.
