### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using an icon style with a custom color and an offset, the offset is incorrect when the screen pixel ratio is not equal to 1. This results in the icon being rendered in the wrong position on the screen.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to be related to how the icon's offset is calculated and applied when the screen pixel ratio is greater than 1. The offset calculation might not be accounting for the pixel ratio, leading to incorrect positioning. Additionally, the custom color application might be affecting the offset calculation or the rendering process.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes
