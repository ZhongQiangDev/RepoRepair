### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `VectorSource.getExtent()` method returns `[Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]` when called inside the `featuresloadend` callback. This indicates that the extent calculation is incorrect, likely because the features have not been properly added to the `VectorSource` before the extent is calculated.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue appears to be the order of operations in the `loadFeaturesXhr` function. Specifically, the `success` callback is being called before the features are added to the `VectorSource` using `source.addFeatures(features)`. This means that when the `featuresloadend` event is triggered, the `VectorSource` does not yet contain the features, leading to an incorrect extent calculation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/extent.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/ol/Feature.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/ol/featureloader.js
```
src/ol/featureloader.js
function: loadFeaturesXhr
function: xhr
```

The `loadFeaturesXhr` function is relevant because it handles the loading of features and the order in which the `success` callback is called. The `xhr` function returns a feature loader that uses `loadFeaturesXhr` and is where the issue is likely occurring. The issue is that the `success` callback is called before `source.addFeatures(features)`.

#### src/ol/geom/SimpleGeometry.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/ol/source/Vector.js
```
src/ol/source/Vector.js
class: VectorSource
```

The `VectorSource` class is relevant because it manages the features and their extent. The issue may be related to how the extent is calculated or updated when features are added.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `src/ol/featureloader.js`
   - `function: loadFeaturesXhr`

2. `src/ol/source/Vector.js`
   - `class: VectorSource`

These locations need to be inspected and potentially edited to fix the problem. Specifically, the order of operations in `loadFeaturesXhr` should be adjusted so that `source.addFeatures(features)` is called before the `success` callback. Additionally, the `VectorSource` class should be checked to ensure that the extent is correctly updated when features are added.
