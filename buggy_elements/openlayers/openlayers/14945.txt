### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves a mismatch between the layer and the map when using the `ImageArcGISRest` source in OpenLayers 7.4. Specifically:

- **Layer-Map Mismatch**: When the `ratio` parameter is set to a value other than 1 or 1.5, the layer does not align correctly with the map.
- **Layer-Map Mismatch After Map Rotation**: Even with the `ratio` set to 1.5 or other values, the layer may not align correctly after the map is rotated.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the default value of the `ratio` parameter in the `ImageArcGISRest` source. The `ratio` parameter is used to adjust the extent of the image, and its default value of 1.5 may not be appropriate for all scenarios, especially when the computer's zoom or scaling ratio is not 100%. This can lead to incorrect rendering and alignment of the layer with the map. Additionally, the issue with map rotation suggests that the transformation or scaling applied during rotation may not be correctly accounting for the `ratio` value.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `examples/layer-clipping-vector.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/transform.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/layer/BaseImage.js`

#### `src/ol/source/ImageArcGISRest.js`
```
src/ol/source/ImageArcGISRest.js
class: ImageArcGISRest
```

The `ImageArcGISRest` class is directly related to the issue described. The `ratio_` attribute and its default value of 1.5 are likely the root cause of the layer-map mismatch. The class methods that handle image fetching and rendering, such as `getImageInternal` and `getRequestUrl_`, may also need to be examined to ensure they correctly handle different `ratio` values and transformations during map rotation.
