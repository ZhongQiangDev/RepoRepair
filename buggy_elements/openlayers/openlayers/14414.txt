### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem involves two main issues:

1. **Incorrect Pixel Value Reading**: When the user tries to print the R value of a pixel, it is not correct, as shown in the image provided. This suggests that the pixel data being read or processed is not accurately reflecting the actual values in the GeoTIFF file.

2. **Non-Responsive Pixel Changes on Level Decrease**: When the user increases the level on the slider, the pixels below the level become white as expected. However, when the level is decreased, the pixels do not revert to their original state. This indicates that the raster operation is not correctly updating the pixel values when the level is decreased.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues described can be attributed to the following potential causes:

1. **Incorrect Pixel Data Handling**: The function `floodRegion` might not be correctly reading or processing the pixel data from the GeoTIFF file. This could be due to incorrect indexing or data type handling when accessing the pixel values.

2. **Raster Operation Not Updating Correctly**: The `raster.changed()` method might not be triggering the necessary updates when the level is decreased. This could be due to the raster operation not being properly configured to handle changes in the level value.

3. **Incorrect Style Application**: The `FloodStyle` might not be correctly applied when the level is decreased, leading to the pixels not reverting to their original state.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- examples/sea-level.js ---
```
examples/sea-level.js
function: floodRegion
function: function_4
```

- **floodRegion**: This function is directly involved in processing the pixel data and could be the source of the incorrect pixel value reading issue. It needs to be checked for correct indexing and data type handling.
- **function_4**: This function sets the `level` property in the `event.data` object before the raster operation, which is crucial for the raster operation to use the correct level value. It should be verified that it is correctly updating the level value.

#### --- src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js ---
```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
function: getBoundingBox
function: getImagesForSource
function: getImagesForTIFF
```

- **GeoTIFFSource**: This class handles the GeoTIFF data and could be relevant if there are issues with loading or processing the GeoTIFF file.
- **getBoundingBox**: This function retrieves the bounding box of the GeoTIFF image and could be relevant if there are issues with the spatial reference of the image.
- **getImagesForSource** and **getImagesForTIFF**: These functions are involved in fetching and processing the GeoTIFF images and could be relevant if there are issues with the image data.

#### --- src/ol/source/Raster.js ---
```
src/ol/source/Raster.js
class: RasterSource
function: createWorker
function: getImageData
```

- **RasterSource**: This class handles the raster operations and could be relevant if there are issues with the raster operation not updating correctly.
- **createWorker**: This function creates the worker for processing the raster operation and could be relevant if there are issues with the worker not being properly configured.
- **getImageData**: This function retrieves the image data from the layer and could be relevant if there are issues with the image data not being correctly retrieved.

#### --- src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions and classes in this file are related to WebGL texture management and do not appear to be directly relevant to the issues described in the GitHub problem.
