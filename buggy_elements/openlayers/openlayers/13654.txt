### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) in UTM projection (EPSG:32636) is not being displayed correctly on a map with a different projection (EPSG:4326 or EPSG:3857). The COG layer appears to be missing, even though the OSM layer and the map view fitting to the COG extent work as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the lack of proper reprojection of the COG data from its native UTM projection (EPSG:32636) to the map's projection (EPSG:4326 or EPSG:3857). The GeoTIFF source does not automatically handle reprojection, and the code does not explicitly set up the necessary transformations. Additionally, the `WebGLTile` layer might not support reprojection out of the box, requiring manual intervention or configuration.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The issue is related to reprojection between EPSG:32636 and EPSG:4326/3857, not specifically the EPSG:3857 projection itself.

#### --- src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
Similar to the previous file, this file defines the EPSG:4326 projection but does not handle reprojection.

#### --- src/ol/proj/transforms.js ---
```
src/ol/proj/transforms.js
function: add
function: get
```
The `add` function can be used to register a transformation function between EPSG:32636 and EPSG:4326/3857, and the `get` function can be used to retrieve the transformation function for use.

#### --- src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js ---
```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
function: getProjection
```
The `GeoTIFFSource` class is responsible for handling GeoTIFF data, and the `getProjection` function can be used to determine the projection of the GeoTIFF image. However, the class does not inherently handle reprojection.

#### --- src/ol/source/TileImage.js ---
```
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
class: TileImage
```
The `TileImage` class manages image tiles and could be relevant if the issue involves tile handling or reprojection within the WebGLTile layer. However, it does not directly handle reprojection between different projections.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/ol/proj/transforms.js
function: add
function: get
```
2. ```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
function: getProjection
```
3. ```
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
class: TileImage
```

These locations are relevant because they involve functions and classes that could be used to set up and manage reprojection between the COG's native projection and the map's projection.
