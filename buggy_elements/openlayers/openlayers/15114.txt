### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using WebGL layers to render polygons with holes, the fill color appears to be overlaid multiple times, resulting in a darker appearance than expected. This issue occurs specifically with valid GeoJSON geometries, while invalid geometries render correctly. The problem seems to be related to the orientation of the linear rings (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) and how WebGL handles these orientations.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how WebGL interprets the orientation of the linear rings in the polygon geometry. In valid GeoJSON, the exterior ring is typically counter-clockwise and the interior rings (holes) are clockwise. However, WebGL might be interpreting these orientations differently, leading to incorrect rendering. The problem could be in how the WebGL layer processes the orientation of the rings or how it applies the fill color based on these orientations.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/ol/geom/flat/orient.js

This file contains functions related to the orientation of linear rings, which is directly relevant to the issue described. The following functions are relevant:

```
src/ol/geom/flat/orient.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: linearRingIsClockwise
function: linearRingIsOriented
```

#### src/ol/style/Style.js

This file contains functions and classes related to styling features, but it does not directly handle the orientation of linear rings or the WebGL rendering process. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/webgl/ShaderBuilder.js

This file contains the `ShaderBuilder` class and related functions that generate shader code for WebGL rendering. While it is involved in the rendering process, it does not directly handle the orientation of linear rings. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/ol/webgl/styleparser.js

This file contains functions that parse style properties and generate shader code for WebGL rendering. While it is involved in the rendering process, it does not directly handle the orientation of linear rings. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
