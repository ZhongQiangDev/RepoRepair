### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the vector layer canvas is cropped when the map is rotated. Specifically, when the map is rotated using `shift+ALT+DRAG`, the polygon that should cover the entire width of the map gets cut off, indicating that the canvas size or rendering extent is not being adjusted correctly to accommodate the rotation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the canvas dimensions and transformations are handled during map rotation. When the map is rotated, the rendering extent and transformations need to be recalculated to ensure that the entire vector layer is visible and not cropped. The problem might be related to how the canvas size is set, how transformations are applied, or how the rendering extent is calculated.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/render.js`

This file contains functions that are directly related to canvas rendering and transformations, which are likely involved in the issue.

```
src/ol/render.js
function: toContext
function: getVectorContext
```

- `toContext`: This function initializes the canvas context and sets the canvas dimensions and transformations. It might need to be adjusted to handle the rotated map correctly.
- `getVectorContext`: This function creates a `CanvasImmediateRenderer` object and calculates the transform for converting coordinates from the map's coordinate system to the canvas's pixel coordinate system. It might need to account for the map's rotation.

#### `src/ol/rotationconstraint.js`

This file contains functions related to rotation constraints, but they do not directly handle the canvas rendering or transformations.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/ol/geom/Geometry.js`

This file contains the `Geometry` class, which is related to geometric operations but does not directly handle canvas rendering or transformations.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/ol/interaction/DragRotate.js`

This file contains the `DragRotate` class, which handles the drag rotation interaction. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how the rotation is applied during the interaction.

```
src/ol/interaction/DragRotate.js
class: DragRotate
```

- `DragRotate`: This class manages the drag rotation interaction and updates the map's view based on the rotation angle. It might need to ensure that the canvas size and transformations are updated correctly during the rotation.

#### `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js`

This file contains the `CanvasVectorLayerRenderer` class, which is responsible for rendering vector layers on the canvas. It is directly related to the issue.

```
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js
class: CanvasVectorLayerRenderer
```

- `CanvasVectorLayerRenderer`: This class manages the rendering of vector layers and applies transformations. It might need to be adjusted to handle the rotated map correctly and ensure that the vector layer is not cropped.
