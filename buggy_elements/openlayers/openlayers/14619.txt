### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an `Icon` is cloned, the scale value of the clone becomes an array with different values instead of retaining the original scale value (which is a number). This results in incorrect scaling of the cloned icon.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to how the `setScale` method works. When `setScale` is called, it sets both the height and width of the icon. When the `clone` method is called, it uses these height and width values to set the scale, resulting in an array instead of the original number. This conflict arises because the documentation states that `height` and `width` cannot be used with `scale`, but the implementation does not enforce this.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- examples/icon-scale.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/style/flat.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/style/Icon.js ---
```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
```
The `Icon` class is relevant because it handles the scale property and the cloning of the icon. The issue likely lies within the `Icon` class where the scale is being set and cloned.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
