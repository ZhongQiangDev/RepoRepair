### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is the presence of an unwanted gap between two lines of text in a label feature when using OpenLayers v4.6.4, which was not present in earlier versions like v2.13. The user wants to remove this gap to achieve a styling similar to the previous version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how text is rendered and styled in OpenLayers v4.6.4 compared to v2.13. Specifically, the issue could be related to how line breaks (`\n`) are handled in the `ol.style.Text` class, or how the text is measured and positioned on the canvas. The gap might be introduced due to changes in font metrics, line height, or text rendering logic.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/render/canvas.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
class: CanvasTextBuilder
```

The `CanvasTextBuilder` class is responsible for rendering text on a canvas. It handles text properties such as font, alignment, fill, stroke, and placement. The `drawText` method processes the geometry and feature to render the text, and the `setTextStyle` method sets the text style for rendering. These methods could be relevant to the issue of text spacing.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/style/Image.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/style/Text.js`

```
src/ol/style/Text.js
class: Text
```

The `Text` class handles various text styling properties for vector features. It includes attributes like `font_`, `textAlign_`, `textBaseline_`, and `padding_`, which are relevant to text rendering and spacing. The class also provides getter and setter methods for these attributes, which could be involved in controlling the gap between lines of text.
