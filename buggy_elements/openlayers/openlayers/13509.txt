### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `WebGlTile` layer remains visible even after the visibility of its parent `Group` layer is set to `false`. This issue does not occur when using a `Tile` layer instead of a `WebGlTile` layer.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the `WebGlTile` layer handles visibility changes when it is part of a `Group` layer. The `WebGlTile` layer may not be properly responding to the visibility changes propagated from the `Group` layer. This could be due to a missing or incorrect implementation of visibility checks within the `WebGlTileLayerRenderer` or the `WebGLTileLayer` class.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/ol/layer/Group.js
class: LayerGroup
```
2. ```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```
3. ```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
function: getRenderExtent
```

These locations are relevant because the `LayerGroup` class manages the visibility of its child layers, and the `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the `WebGlTile` layer. The `getRenderExtent` function may also play a role in determining the visible area for rendering, which could be affected by the layer's visibility.
