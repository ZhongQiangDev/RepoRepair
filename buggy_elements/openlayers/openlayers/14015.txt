### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the source of a WebGL tile layer is replaced using `setSource()` or the view projection is changed, the cached tile textures are not updated correctly. As a result, tiles from the old source or projection may still be displayed when they should not be.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the cache management for tile textures does not properly handle changes in the source or view projection. When `setSource()` is called or the view projection changes, the existing tile textures in the cache should be invalidated and replaced with new ones corresponding to the updated source or projection. However, this does not seem to be happening, leading to the display of incorrect tiles.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/layer/Layer.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
```

The `WebGLTileLayer` class is responsible for managing sources and rendering processes. It includes methods like `setSource()` and `handleSourceUpdate_()`, which are likely involved in the issue. When the source is changed, the cache should be cleared or updated, but this might not be happening correctly.

#### `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js`

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
function: getCacheKey
```

The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class manages tile textures and caching. The `getCacheKey` function generates a unique cache key based on the source and tile coordinates. If the source changes, the cache key should change, but if this is not handled correctly, the old textures might still be used.
