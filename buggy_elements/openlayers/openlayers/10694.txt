### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `setOpacity` function for the image of a feature style does not have any effect on the UI after updating to version 6.2.0. In version 6.1.1, the feature blinks (indicating that opacity changes are being applied), but in version 6.2.0, the feature does not blink, suggesting that the opacity changes are not being applied.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in how opacity is applied to the image of a feature style in version 6.2.0. This could involve changes in the rendering process, the way opacity is set or propagated within the style or image classes, or how the canvas context handles opacity during drawing.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/layer/Vector.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas.js`
```
src/ol/render/canvas.js
function: drawImageOrLabel
```
The `drawImageOrLabel` function is responsible for rendering images and labels on the canvas. If opacity is not being applied correctly, this function could be a potential source of the issue.

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`
```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
```
The `Icon` class manages the visual representation of icons for vector features, including opacity. If the opacity is not being set correctly on the icon, this class could be involved.

#### `src/ol/style/Image.js`
```
src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
```
The `ImageStyle` class manages the visual properties of image-based symbols, including opacity. If the opacity is not being propagated correctly through this class, it could be a cause of the issue.

#### `src/ol/style/Style.js`
```
src/ol/style/Style.js
class: Style
```
The `Style` class is a container for vector feature rendering styles, including the image style. If the image style's opacity is not being set or applied correctly within this class, it could be a contributing factor.
