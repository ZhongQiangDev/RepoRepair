### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the labels on the graticule layer show irregular intervals, such as 3', 3'.01", and 2'.59", while the grid lines appear to be regular. This inconsistency between the labels and the grid lines is unexpected and potentially confusing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The irregular intervals in the labels suggest that there might be an issue with how the coordinates are being calculated or formatted for display. This could be due to rounding errors, incorrect conversion between degrees, minutes, and seconds, or an issue with the logic that determines where labels should be placed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

### Conclusion

None of the provided functions or classes in the relevant files seem directly related to the issue of label intervals on the graticule layer. The problem likely lies in the code responsible for generating and formatting the labels on the graticule layer, which is not included in the provided file information. Therefore, the relevant code for inspection or editing is not present in the given files.
