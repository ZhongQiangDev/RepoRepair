### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the red dots (representing a 'hover' effect) are always rendered below the selected feature, regardless of the zIndex setting. The user expects the red dots to appear above the selected feature when the custom SVG icon is selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the zIndex is managed or applied in the rendering process. The zIndex might not be respected due to the order in which the layers or features are rendered, or there could be a problem with how the zIndex is set or interpreted by the rendering engine. The `ol.select.Interaction` might be applying styles or rendering the selected feature in a way that overrides or ignores the zIndex of other layers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/interaction.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/ol/interaction/Select.js ---
```
src/ol/interaction/Select.js
class: Select
```
The `Select` class is responsible for managing the selection of features and applying styles to them. The issue might be related to how the `Select` class handles the zIndex of the selected features.

#### --- src/ol/layer/Base.js ---
```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
class: BaseLayer
```
The `BaseLayer` class manages layer properties such as zIndex. The issue might be related to how the zIndex is set or managed within this class.

#### --- src/ol/layer/Layer.js ---
```
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
class: Layer
```
The `Layer` class is responsible for rendering layers and managing their properties, including zIndex. The issue might be related to how the zIndex is applied during rendering.

#### --- src/ol/renderer/vector.js ---
```
src/ol/renderer/vector.js
function: renderFeature
function: renderFeatureInternal
function: renderGeometry
```
The rendering functions in this file are responsible for rendering features and geometries. The issue might be related to how the zIndex is respected or applied during the rendering process.
