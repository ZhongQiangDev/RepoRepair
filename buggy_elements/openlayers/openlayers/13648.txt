### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when loading a COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) in OpenLayers, only the upper part of the image is displayed, while the full image is expected to be shown as it appears in other viewers like geotiff.io or QGIS.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the COG is being interpreted or rendered in OpenLayers. Possible causes include:
- Incorrect handling of non-square pixels in the COG.
- Issues with the reprojection of the COG data.
- Problems with the tile loading or rendering process in the `TileLayer`.
- Incorrect configuration or processing of the GeoTIFF data in the `GeoTIFFSource`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/geom/Polygon.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/layer/Tile.js`
```
src/ol/layer/Tile.js
class: TileLayer
```
The `TileLayer` class is responsible for handling tiled image layers. If there is an issue with how tiles are being loaded or rendered, this class could be relevant.

#### `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/reproj/Image.js`
```
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
class: ReprojImage
```
The `ReprojImage` class handles the reprojection of images from one projection to another. If there is an issue with reprojection, this class could be relevant.

#### `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js`
```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
class: GeoTIFFSource
function: getBoundingBox
function: getResolution
function: getProjection
```
The `GeoTIFFSource` class is responsible for handling GeoTIFF data, including loading, configuring, and processing the images. The `getBoundingBox`, `getResolution`, and `getProjection` functions are particularly relevant as they deal with the spatial properties of the GeoTIFF data, which could affect how the image is displayed.
