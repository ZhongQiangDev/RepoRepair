### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using `ol.render.toContext()` with a specified `pixelRatio` for canvas immediate rendering, the `lineDash` property of the stroke style is not scaled by the `pixelRatio`. This results in dashed lines appearing differently on devices with different pixel ratios, with the dashes and gaps becoming much shorter in proportion to the line width on high-DPI displays.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the `lineDash` array values are not being scaled by the `pixelRatio` when rendering with `ol.render.toContext()`. In contrast, when rendering on a map, the `lineDash` values are automatically scaled by the `pixelRatio`, ensuring consistent appearance across different devices. The `lineDash` values need to be scaled by the `pixelRatio` in the immediate rendering context to match the behavior of map rendering.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/render.js`

```
src/ol/render.js
function: toContext
```

The `toContext` function initializes the canvas context and applies the `pixelRatio` for scaling. However, it does not handle the scaling of the `lineDash` values. This function is relevant because it sets up the context where the issue occurs.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
class: CanvasImmediateRenderer
```

The `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class is responsible for rendering geometries on the canvas. It manages the stroke style, including the `lineDash` property. This class is relevant because it applies the stroke style to the canvas context, and it needs to ensure that the `lineDash` values are scaled by the `pixelRatio`.

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/LineStringBuilder.js`

```
src/ol/render/canvas/LineStringBuilder.js
class: CanvasLineStringBuilder
```

The `CanvasLineStringBuilder` class is responsible for generating drawing instructions for line strings. It handles the stroke style and `lineDash` property. This class is relevant because it needs to ensure that the `lineDash` values are scaled by the `pixelRatio` when drawing line strings.

#### `src/ol/renderer/vector.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to rendering features and geometries in the vector renderer, but they do not directly handle the scaling of `lineDash` values in the immediate rendering context.

#### `src/ol/style/Stroke.js`

```
src/ol/style/Stroke.js
class: Stroke
```

The `Stroke` class manages the stroke style properties, including `lineDash`. This class is relevant because it stores the `lineDash` values, and it may need to provide a method to scale these values by the `pixelRatio`.
