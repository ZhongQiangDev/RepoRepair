### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Y position of the bottom of the icons changes when the `scale` is modified, even though the `displacement` is set to keep the icons at the same Y position. This suggests an unexpected interaction between the `scale` and `displacement` properties of `ol.style.Icon`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the `scale` and `displacement` properties are applied to the icon's position. When scaling an icon, the anchor point and displacement should ideally be adjusted to maintain the same visual position of the icon's bottom. However, if the scaling is applied before the displacement, or if the displacement is not correctly recalculated after scaling, the bottom of the icon may shift.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### examples/icon-scale.js
```
examples/icon-scale.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: updateStyle
```
- `function_1` and `function_2` both involve scaling the icon using `setScale`, which could be relevant to the issue.
- `updateStyle` directly manipulates the `scale` and `displacement` properties of the icon style, making it highly relevant.

#### src/ol/style/flat.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- This file deals with default styles and helper functions for creating style objects but does not directly handle the interaction between `scale` and `displacement`.

#### src/ol/style/Icon.js
```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
function: calculateScale
```
- The `Icon` class manages the icon's properties, including `scale` and `displacement`, and could be involved in the issue.
- `calculateScale` is used to determine scaling factors, which might be relevant if the scaling logic is incorrect.

#### src/ol/style/IconImage.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- This file deals with image management and hit detection but does not directly handle the `scale` and `displacement` properties.

#### src/ol/style/Image.js
```
src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
```
- The `ImageStyle` class is the base class for `Icon` and manages common properties like `scale` and `displacement`, making it relevant to the issue.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `examples/icon-scale.js`
   - `function_1`
   - `function_2`
   - `updateStyle`

2. `src/ol/style/Icon.js`
   - `Icon` class
   - `calculateScale` function

3. `src/ol/style/Image.js`
   - `ImageStyle` class

These locations are directly or potentially related to the interaction between `scale` and `displacement` properties and should be inspected or edited to fix the problem.
