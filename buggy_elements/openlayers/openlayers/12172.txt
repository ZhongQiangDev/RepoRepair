### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an icon style (`ol/style/Icon`) with `displacement` set is used, the icon gets clipped. This means that parts of the icon are not visible, which is not the expected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The clipping issue likely arises from how the `displacement` property is handled in the rendering process. When an icon is displaced, the rendering system might not correctly account for the displacement when determining the bounds or clipping area for the icon. This could result in parts of the displaced icon being outside the expected rendering area and thus getting clipped.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- examples/icon-negative.js ---
```
examples/icon-negative.js
function: createStyle
```
The `createStyle` function sets up the icon style, including the `anchor` and `displacement` properties. This function is directly related to the issue since it configures the icon style that is experiencing the clipping problem.

#### --- examples/icon-scale.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to scaling and dynamic effects but do not directly address the displacement and clipping issue.

#### --- src/ol/render/VectorContext.js ---
```
src/ol/render/VectorContext.js
class: VectorContext
```
The `VectorContext` class is responsible for rendering various geometries and features, including icons. It includes methods for setting styles and drawing features, which could be relevant to how the displaced icon is rendered and potentially clipped.

#### --- src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js ---
```
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
class: CanvasImmediateRenderer
```
The `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class handles the immediate rendering of vector data to an HTML5 Canvas. It includes methods for rendering different geometry types and managing styles, which could be involved in the clipping issue when rendering displaced icons.

#### --- src/ol/style/Icon.js ---
```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
function: calculateScale
```
The `Icon` class defines the visual representation of icons and includes properties like `displacement` and `anchor`. The `calculateScale` function might be indirectly related if scaling issues contribute to the clipping problem.
