### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when using the WebGLTile renderer, the image smoothing setting (`imageSmoothing: false`) from the tile source is not respected. This results in pixelated edges and distortion in the rendered image, especially noticeable in the Sea Level example when zoomed in. The issue is particularly evident when the map is panned, and thin lines of "sea" appear along some contours.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the WebGLTile renderer does not currently pass the `imageSmoothing` setting from the tile source to the `TileTexture` class. As a result, the `TileTexture` always uses `gl.LINEAR` for its texture filtering, which leads to image smoothing even when it should be disabled. To fix this, the renderer needs to pass the `imageSmoothing` setting to the `TileTexture`, which can then use `gl.NEAREST` for its texture filtering if `imageSmoothing` is set to `false`.
