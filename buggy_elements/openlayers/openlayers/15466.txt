### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `declutterMode` is set to something other than 'declutter', the image and label combinations are not rendered correctly. Specifically, the issue arises when a layer's style function returns both imagery and text, and the user wants to declutter only the text while keeping the imagery unaffected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the current implementation of the `declutter` option, which is a boolean value. This boolean value does not allow for granular control over which elements (imagery or text) should be decluttered. The user suggests changing the `declutter` option to a more flexible format (e.g., `none`, `text`, `geometry`, `both`) to allow for more specific control over decluttering behavior.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/ol/layer/Vector.js ---
```
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
class: VectorLayer
```
The `VectorLayer` class is responsible for rendering vector data, which includes both imagery and text. The issue described involves the rendering of these elements, so this class is relevant.

#### --- src/ol/render/canvas/BuilderGroup.js ---
```
src/ol/render/canvas/BuilderGroup.js
class: BuilderGroup
```
The `BuilderGroup` class manages the creation of canvas instructions for rendering, including decluttering. Since the issue involves decluttering, this class is relevant.

#### --- src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js ---
```
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
class: Executor
function: getDeclutterBox
function: horizontalTextAlign
```
The `Executor` class is responsible for executing rendering instructions, including decluttering. The `getDeclutterBox` function is specifically related to decluttering, and `horizontalTextAlign` is related to text rendering, so both are relevant.

#### --- src/ol/style/Image.js ---
```
src/ol/style/Image.js
class: ImageStyle
```
The `ImageStyle` class manages the visual properties of image-based symbols. Since the issue involves imagery, this class is relevant.

#### --- src/ol/style/Text.js ---
```
src/ol/style/Text.js
class: Text
```
The `Text` class manages text styling properties. Since the issue involves text, this class is relevant.
