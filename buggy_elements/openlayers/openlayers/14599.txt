### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the attributions from a visible sub-layer are displayed in the info popup even when the parent group layer is set to be invisible. This is unexpected because the attributions should not be displayed when the parent group layer is not visible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the visibility of the group layer and its sub-layers are managed in relation to the display of attributions. When a group layer is set to be invisible, its sub-layers should also be treated as invisible for the purposes of displaying attributions. However, the current implementation seems to be displaying attributions from sub-layers regardless of the group layer's visibility.

```
The `LayerGroup` class manages a collection of layers and their visibility. It is relevant because it handles the visibility of group layers and their sub-layers.

#### --- src/ol/source/TileWMS.js ---
```
src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
class: TileWMS
```
The `TileWMS` class is relevant because it handles the attributions for WMS layers. The issue might be related to how attributions are managed when the layer's visibility changes.
