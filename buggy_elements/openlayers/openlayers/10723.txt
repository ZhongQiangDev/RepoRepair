### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the view projection crosses the dateline (180Â° longitude), the graticule (grid of meridians and parallels) does not display correctly. Specifically:
- Most meridians do not appear.
- Parallels begin at the dateline and/or extend too far.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the graticule lines are generated and rendered when the projection crosses the dateline. The problem could be due to:
- Incorrect handling of longitude values that wrap around the dateline.
- Inaccurate calculation of the start and end points for meridians and parallels.
- Normalization of longitudes by `proj4` causing issues with line continuity across the dateline.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/ol/geom/flat/area.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/geom/flat/straightchunk.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/ol/layer/Graticule.js`
```
src/ol/layer/Graticule.js
class: Graticule
```
The `Graticule` class is responsible for rendering the graticule grid. The issue likely lies within the methods that generate and render the meridians and parallels, such as `createGraticule_`, `getMeridian_`, and `getParallel_`.

#### `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`
```
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
function: fromEPSG4326
function: toEPSG4326
```
The `fromEPSG4326` and `toEPSG4326` functions handle coordinate transformations between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3857. These transformations might need to be adjusted to handle the dateline crossing correctly.

#### `src/ol/proj/Projection.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
