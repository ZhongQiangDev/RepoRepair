### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the WebGLTile Layers in OpenLayer do not currently support setting a custom blending function, specifically `gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE, gl.ONE)`, for a subset of Tile Layers. This is necessary for the user's use case of blending images from different Tile Layers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the WebGLTile Layer implementation in OpenLayer does not provide an API to set custom blending functions. The blending function is hardcoded or set to a default value, and there is no mechanism to override it for specific layers. The user needs a way to specify a custom blending function for certain WebGLTile Layers.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
class: WebGLTileLayer
```

The `WebGLTileLayer` class is relevant because it manages the WebGL rendering of tile layers. It needs to be modified to include a blending function flag in its style configuration.

#### src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js

```
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
class: WebGLTileLayerRenderer
```

The `WebGLTileLayerRenderer` class is relevant because it handles the actual WebGL rendering of the tiles. It needs to be modified to apply the custom blending function specified in the layer's style.

#### src/ol/webgl/Helper.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to WebGL helper utilities but do not directly handle the blending function for WebGLTile Layers.

#### src/ol/webgl/ShaderBuilder.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `ShaderBuilder` class is used for constructing shaders but does not directly handle the blending function.

#### src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `TileTexture` class manages textures for tiles but does not handle the blending function.

### Summary of Relevant Locations
