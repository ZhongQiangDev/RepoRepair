### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that icons on the `WebGLPoints` layer are distorted when the `icon-rotate-with-view` property is set to `true` and the viewport is non-square. The expected behavior is that the icons should be displayed without distortion regardless of the viewport shape.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The distortion likely occurs due to incorrect handling of the aspect ratio when rotating the icons with the view. When the viewport is non-square, the aspect ratio of the viewport affects how the icons are rendered. If the rotation is not properly adjusted for this aspect ratio, it can lead to distortion. The issue might be related to how the WebGL shaders handle the rotation and scaling of the icons.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js`

This file contains the `WebGLPointsLayer` class, which is directly involved in rendering the points layer where the issue occurs. The class processes the style properties and configures the WebGL shaders for rendering. Therefore, it is relevant to the problem.

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js
class: WebGLPointsLayer
```

#### `src/ol/render/canvas/style.js`

This file contains various functions related to style evaluation and construction, including `buildIcon`, which is responsible for creating and configuring the `Icon` object. The `buildIcon` function evaluates properties like `icon-rotate-with-view`, which is relevant to the issue.

```
src/ol/render/canvas/style.js
function: buildIcon
```

#### `src/ol/render/webgl/MixedGeometryBatch.js`

This file contains the `MixedGeometryBatch` class, which manages and optimizes the rendering of mixed geometry types. However, it does not directly handle the icon rotation or aspect ratio issues. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/ol/style/Icon.js`

This file contains the `Icon` class, which defines the visual representation of icons. The `calculateScale` function is used to calculate scaling factors, which might be relevant if the scaling is not correctly adjusted for the aspect ratio during rotation.

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
class: Icon
function: calculateScale
```
