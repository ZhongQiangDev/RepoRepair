### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the current version of the `scratch-vm` dependency is outdated. The latest version `0.1.0-prerelease.1513710334-prerelease.1513710351` is not covered by the current version range. This means that the project is missing out on new features, fixes, and performance improvements that come with the updated version of `scratch-vm`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the project's `package.json` file specifies a version range for the `scratch-vm` dependency that does not include the latest version. This could be due to a few reasons:
- The version range is too restrictive.
- The project has not been updated to include the latest version range.
- There might be compatibility issues with the latest version that prevent it from being included in the current version range.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `src/containers/blocks.jsx`
This file contains the `Blocks` class, which integrates the Scratch Blocks workspace with the Scratch VM and UI. Since the issue is related to the `scratch-vm` dependency, this file is relevant because it directly interacts with the VM.

```
src/containers/blocks.jsx
class: Blocks
```

#### `src/lib/blocks.js`
This file contains a factory function that sets up and initializes ScratchBlocks with dynamic dropdown menus for various Scratch block types. It interacts with the VM to fetch data for dropdown options. This file is relevant because it also interacts with the VM.

```
src/lib/blocks.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/lib/vm-listener-hoc.jsx`
This file contains a Higher Order Component (HOC) that wraps a given React component and adds VM event handling capabilities. It listens to various VM events and maps them to Redux actions. This file is relevant because it handles VM events.

```
src/lib/vm-listener-hoc.jsx
function: function_1
class: VMListener
```

#### `src/reducers/vm.js`
This file contains a reducer function that handles state updates for the VM. It also contains an action creator function `setVM` that sets the VM instance in the Redux state. This file is relevant because it manages the VM state.

```
src/reducers/vm.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```

#### Other Files
The remaining files and functions provided do not seem directly related to the issue of updating the `scratch-vm` dependency. They are either utility functions or part of the UI and do not interact with the VM in a way that would be affected by the version update.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
