### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that on an iPad, when the user clicks the add sprite/costume/backdrop button, the sprite library opens with the search bar focused, causing the keyboard to pop up. This results in the keyboard taking over half the screen, making it difficult to see the sprites.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely related to the focus being set on the search bar when the library is opened. This focus event triggers the keyboard to appear on touch devices like iPads. The issue could be due to the search bar being automatically focused when the library modal is rendered, or due to an event handler that focuses the search bar when the modal is opened.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/components/asset-panel/asset-panel.jsx
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx

#### src/components/library/library.jsx
```
src/components/library/library.jsx
class: LibraryComponent
```
The `LibraryComponent` class is likely responsible for rendering the library modal and managing the search bar. The issue might be related to how the search bar is focused when the modal is opened. The `handleFocus` and `handleBlur` methods, as well as the `handleFilterChange` method, could be relevant if they handle the focus on the search bar.

#### src/components/modal/modal.jsx
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
