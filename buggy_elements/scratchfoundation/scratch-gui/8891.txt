### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the setting switches, which use buttons with icons, are not colorblind-friendly. Specifically, the active state of the icons is colored in, and the inactive state is grayed out. However, when viewed in grayscale, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the active and inactive states, making it challenging for colorblind users to identify which option is selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the reliance on color alone to indicate the active state of the buttons. When the buttons are grayed out for the inactive state and colored for the active state, the distinction is lost in grayscale. To make the interface colorblind-friendly, the design should incorporate additional visual cues, such as background color changes or other non-color-dependent indicators.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/components/button/button.jsx`
