### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in Scratch 3.0, the min and max values for slider monitors are fixed at 0-100, whereas in Scratch 2.0, these values can be customized via a right-click menu. This prevents users from setting custom ranges for sliders in Scratch 3.0, which limits the functionality compared to Scratch 2.0.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the way the slider monitors are initialized and managed in Scratch 3.0. Specifically, the default min and max values are hardcoded to 0 and 100, and there is no mechanism in place to allow users to customize these values. Additionally, the issue may be related to how the monitor properties are stored and updated in the application state.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/components/monitor/monitor.jsx`

This file contains the `MonitorComponent`, which is responsible for rendering and managing the monitor's display mode, including the slider mode. However, it does not directly handle the min and max values for the slider. Therefore, this file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/components/monitor-list/monitor-list.jsx`

This file contains the `MonitorList` component, which renders a list of monitors. It does not directly handle the min and max values for the slider. Therefore, this file contains no relevant functions/classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/containers/monitor.jsx`

This file contains the `Monitor` class, which manages the monitor's position, drag handling, mode management, and data import/export. It also contains functions that filter monitor modes based on the opcode and map state and dispatch actions to the component.

The `Monitor` class is relevant because it manages the monitor's mode and could potentially handle the min and max values for the slider. The `function_1` and `function_4` functions are also relevant because they filter monitor modes and dispatch actions to add, resize, and remove monitor rectangles, which could be related to setting the min and max values.

```
src/containers/monitor.jsx
function: function_1
function: function_4
class: Monitor
```

#### `src/lib/monitor-adapter.js`

This file contains functions that process monitor properties and generate monitor objects for GUI rendering. The `function_2` function processes the monitor's properties, including the value, which could be related to setting the min and max values for the slider.

```
src/lib/monitor-adapter.js
function: function_2
```

#### `src/reducers/monitor-layout.js`

This file contains functions that handle state changes for monitor rectangles, including adding, moving, resizing, and removing monitors. The `_addMonitorRect`, `_moveMonitorRect`, `_resizeMonitorRect`, and `_removeMonitorRect` functions are relevant because they update the monitor's position and dimensions, which could be related to setting the min and max values.

```
src/reducers/monitor-layout.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: function_4
function: function_5
```
