### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a sprite is dragged to another space, the duplicate menu does not appear as expected. Instead, the OS's context menu appears, which is not the intended behavior. The expected behavior is for the duplicate menu to appear when right-clicking on the sprite.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the way the context menu is being triggered and managed during drag-and-drop operations. When a sprite is dragged, the drag event might be interfering with the right-click event, causing the OS's context menu to appear instead of the application's custom context menu. This could be due to event propagation issues, incorrect event handling, or a conflict between drag-and-drop and context menu functionalities.
