### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the `GitHub Problem Description` is that the project is using an outdated version of the `autoprefixer` dependency (version 8.6.5), while a newer version (9.0.0) has been released. This newer version includes breaking changes and improvements that the current project is not taking advantage of.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the project's `package.json` file specifies a version range for `autoprefixer` that does not include the latest version 9.0.0. This means that when the project is built or dependencies are installed, it will only install version 8.6.5 or a compatible version within the specified range. To fix this, the version range in `package.json` needs to be updated to include version 9.0.0.
