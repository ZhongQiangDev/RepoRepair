### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the `GitHub Problem Description` is that the `scratch-blocks` devDependency has been updated to a version (`0.1.0-prerelease.1542293672`) that is not covered by the current version range in the project. This means that the project's dependency management configuration does not allow for this specific version of `scratch-blocks` to be installed, potentially leading to issues with new features, fixes, or performance improvements that the updated version provides.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause behind this behavior is likely related to the version range specified for the `scratch-blocks` dependency in the project's `package.json` file. The version range may be too restrictive, not allowing for the installation of the new prerelease version. This could be due to the use of a specific version number, a range that does not include the new version, or a lack of a wildcard or range operator that would permit the installation of newer versions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `webpack.config.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/containers/blocks.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/lib/blocks.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, none of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the issue described in the `GitHub Problem Description`. The issue is related to dependency management and version ranges, which would typically be handled in the `package.json` file and possibly in the `package-lock.json` file, neither of which are included in the provided file information.

Therefore, the final answer is:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
