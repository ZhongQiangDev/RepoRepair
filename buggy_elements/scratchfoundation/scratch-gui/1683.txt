### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the navigation bar needs to be designed and integrated into the GUI. The current issue is that the navigation bar is not yet implemented or integrated, and most of its features are marked as "Coming Soon."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause behind the wrong behavior is the absence of a navigation bar component in the current codebase. The GUI component (`GUIComponent` in `gui.jsx`) is responsible for rendering the main interface, but it currently only includes a `MenuBar` at the top and does not have a navigation bar. The `MenuBar` is not the same as a navigation bar, as it contains different elements like a logo, save/load buttons, and a feedback button.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/components/controls/controls.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/components/gui/gui.jsx`
```
src/components/gui/gui.jsx
function: function_1
```
The `GUIComponent` function is responsible for rendering the main GUI structure. It currently includes a `MenuBar` but does not have a navigation bar. This function needs to be updated to include the navigation bar.

#### `src/components/menu-bar/menu-bar.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
The `MenuBar` component is not the same as a navigation bar and does not need to be modified for this issue.

#### `src/components/stage-header/stage-header.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
The `StageHeaderComponent` is related to the stage header and does not pertain to the navigation bar.

#### `src/containers/gui.jsx`
```
src/containers/gui.jsx
class: GUI
```
The `GUI` class is a higher-level component that manages the graphical interface. It renders the `GUIComponent`, which is where the navigation bar should be integrated. This class needs to be updated to pass the necessary props for the navigation bar to the `GUIComponent`.
