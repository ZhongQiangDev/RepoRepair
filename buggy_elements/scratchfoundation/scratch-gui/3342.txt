### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the selected sprite or backdrop does not have a watermark displayed in the blocks workspace. The goal is to add a watermark of the selected sprite or backdrop in the top-right corner of the blocks workspace, with specific sizing, positioning, and styling requirements.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is likely due to the absence of code that handles the rendering of the watermark in the blocks workspace. This involves identifying where the blocks workspace is rendered and adding the necessary logic to display the watermark based on the selected sprite or backdrop.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/components/asset-panel/asset-panel.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes for adding a watermark to the blocks workspace. It is related to the asset panel and its selector, not the blocks workspace.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes for adding a watermark to the blocks workspace. It is related to the asset selector and its items, not the blocks workspace.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx`
This file contains the `BlocksComponent`, which is responsible for rendering the blocks workspace. To add the watermark, we need to modify this component to include the watermark logic.

```
src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### `src/components/sprite-selector/sprite-selector.jsx`
This file contains the `SpriteSelectorComponent`, which manages the sprites. It is relevant because it handles the selection of sprites, and we need to ensure that the selected sprite information is passed to the blocks workspace for the watermark.

```
src/components/sprite-selector/sprite-selector.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### `src/components/stage-selector/stage-selector.jsx`
This file contains the `StageSelector` component, which manages the stage and backdrops. It is relevant because it handles the selection of backdrops, and we need to ensure that the selected backdrop information is passed to the blocks workspace for the watermark.

```
src/components/stage-selector/stage-selector.jsx
function: function_1
```
