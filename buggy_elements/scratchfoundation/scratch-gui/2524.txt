### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the `GitHub Problem Description` is that the current version of the `scratch-paint` dependency (`0.2.0-prerelease.20180621213404`) is outdated and does not cover the latest version (`0.2.0-prerelease.20180626185754`). This means the project is missing out on the latest features, fixes, and performance improvements provided by the new version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause behind this behavior is that the version range specified in the project's configuration files (likely `package.json`) does not include the latest version of `scratch-paint`. This could be due to a fixed version number, a version range that is too restrictive, or a lack of an update mechanism in the project's build or dependency management process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `webpack.config.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/containers/paint-editor-wrapper.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/lib/storage.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/reducers/vm.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

After examining each file, it is clear that none of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the dependency version management issue described in the GitHub problem. The issue is likely related to the project's `package.json` file, which is not included in the provided information. Therefore, the relevant location to inspect or edit would be:

```
package.json
```

This file should be checked to ensure that the version range for the `scratch-paint` dependency is updated to include the latest version (`0.2.0-prerelease.20180626185754`).
