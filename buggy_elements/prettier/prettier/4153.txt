### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that Prettier fails to detect the language of a fenced code block when there are additional attributes following the language identifier. Specifically, when the code block is formatted as  `js {cmd=node .line-numbers}` instead of just  `js`, Prettier does not apply the expected formatting rules for the specified language (`js` in this case).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how Prettier identifies and processes the language of a fenced code block. When additional attributes are present after the language identifier, Prettier may not correctly parse the language identifier, leading it to treat the entire block as plain text or an unrecognized language. This results in the code block not being formatted according to the rules for the specified language.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/language-markdown/embed.js`

```
src/language-markdown/embed.js
function: embed
```

The `embed` function is responsible for processing code blocks in Markdown documents. It retrieves the appropriate parser for the code block's language using `getParserName`. If the function does not correctly handle additional attributes after the language identifier, it may fail to identify the correct parser, leading to the observed issue.

#### `src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js`

```
src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js
function: parse
```

The `parse` function processes the input text using a sequence of remark plugins. One of these plugins, `restoreUnescapedCharacter`, might be relevant if it affects how the language identifier and attributes are parsed. However, the primary concern is likely in how the `parse` function handles the fenced code block syntax.

#### `src/main/ast-to-doc.js`

```
src/main/ast-to-doc.js
function: genericPrint
function: printAstToDoc
```

The `genericPrint` and `printAstToDoc` functions are involved in converting the AST into a formatted document. If the AST does not correctly represent the language of the code block due to issues in parsing, these functions will not apply the correct formatting rules.

#### `src/main/options.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in `options.js` are primarily concerned with inferring and normalizing parsers based on file paths and options. They do not directly handle the parsing of fenced code blocks.

#### `src/main/parser.js`

```
src/main/parser.js
function: parse
function: resolveParser
```

The `parse` function retrieves and prepares parsers for use, and the `resolveParser` function resolves the appropriate parser based on the provided options. If the language identifier is not correctly parsed due to additional attributes, these functions may not select the correct parser, leading to the observed issue.
