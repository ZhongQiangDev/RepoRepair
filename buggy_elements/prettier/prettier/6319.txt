### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the input `5 |> # * 2` results in a `SyntaxError` due to the unexpected character `#`. The expected behavior is that the minimal pipeline proposal should be supported, allowing the code to be parsed and formatted correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely due to the parser not recognizing the `#` character in the context of the minimal pipeline proposal. This suggests that the parser is either not configured to support the minimal pipeline proposal or is not correctly handling the syntax associated with it.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/main/ast-to-doc.js ---
```
src/main/ast-to-doc.js
function: callPluginPrintFunction
function: printAstToDoc
```
These functions are responsible for printing the AST nodes and converting them into a document. If the parser is not correctly handling the minimal pipeline proposal, the AST generated might be incorrect, leading to issues in these functions.

#### --- src/main/options-normalizer.js ---
```
src/main/options-normalizer.js
function: normalizeOptions
function: optionInfosToSchemas
function: optionInfoToSchema
```
These functions are involved in normalizing and validating options. If the `proposal` option is not correctly set or validated, it could lead to the parser not being configured to support the minimal pipeline proposal.

#### --- src/main/options.js ---
```
src/main/options.js
function: getPlugin
function: inferParser
function: normalize
```
These functions are responsible for getting the correct plugin and parser based on the options provided. If the `astFormat` or `parser` is not correctly inferred or normalized, it could result in the wrong parser being used.

#### --- src/main/parser.js ---
```
src/main/parser.js
function: getParsers
function: parse
function: resolveParser
```
These functions are directly involved in parsing the input text into an AST. If the parser is not correctly configured to support the minimal pipeline proposal, it will fail to parse the input correctly.

#### --- src/main/support.js ---
```
src/main/support.js
function: getSupportInfo
```
This function generates a list of supported languages and options. If the minimal pipeline proposal is not correctly included in the supported options, it could lead to issues in other parts of the code.
