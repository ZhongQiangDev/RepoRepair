### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that Prettier 2.8.0 is adding unnecessary spaces around pipe arguments in Angular pipes. This results in the following transformation:

**Input:**
```html
{{ (user$ | async).credit | currency:'CAD':'symbol-narrow':'4.2-2' }}
{{ (user$ | async).items | slice:1:5 }}
```

**Output:**
```html
{{ (user$ | async).credit | currency : 'CAD' : 'symbol-narrow' : '4.2-2' }}
{{ (user$ | async).items | slice : 1 : 5 }}
```

The expected behavior is to maintain the original formatting without adding extra spaces, especially when the arguments are strings or numbers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to how Prettier handles the formatting of Angular pipes. Specifically, it seems that Prettier is treating the pipe arguments as separate entities and adding spaces around them, which is not the desired behavior for Angular pipes. This could be due to a lack of specific rules or configurations in Prettier for handling Angular pipes correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/language-js/embed/utils.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/language-js/print/angular.js`

This file contains relevant functions:

```
src/language-js/print/angular.js
function: printAngular
```

The `printAngular` function is responsible for handling various Angular-specific syntax nodes. It includes specific handling for `NGPipeExpression` nodes, which are relevant to the issue described. The function delegates the printing of `NGPipeExpression` nodes to the `printBinaryishExpression` function, which may be responsible for the incorrect formatting.

#### `src/language-js/print/binaryish.js`

This file contains relevant functions:

```
src/language-js/print/binaryish.js
function: printBinaryishExpression
function: printBinaryishExpressions
```

The `printBinaryishExpression` and `printBinaryishExpressions` functions handle the formatting of binary-like expressions, which includes Angular pipe expressions. These functions may be adding the unnecessary spaces around pipe arguments.

#### `src/language-js/print/misc.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/language-js/print/angular.js
function: printAngular

src/language-js/print/binaryish.js

function: printBinaryishExpressions
