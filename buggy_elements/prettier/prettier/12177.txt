### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the formatting of comments in a `switch` statement. Specifically, when a comment is placed after a `case` statement, it is correctly formatted as a trailing comment. However, when a comment is placed after the `default` statement, it is incorrectly formatted as a leading comment on the next line instead of remaining on the same line as the `default` keyword.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prettier handles comments in `switch` statements. The `default` case might be treated differently from `case` statements in terms of comment attachment logic. This could be due to how the AST nodes for `case` and `default` are processed or how comments are attached to these nodes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

src/language-js/comments.js
function: handleIfStatementComments
function: handleConditionalExpressionComments
function: handleWhileComments
function: handleForComments
function: handleTryStatementComments
```

These functions handle comment placement for various control flow statements. While they do not directly handle `switch` statements, they may provide insight into how comments are attached to different types of statements.

```
src/main/comments.js
function: addBlockOrNotComment
function: addBlockStatementFirstComment
function: addLeadingComment
function: addTrailingComment
function: addDanglingComment
```

These functions are responsible for attaching comments to AST nodes in various ways. The issue might be related to how comments are attached to `default` cases versus `case` statements.
