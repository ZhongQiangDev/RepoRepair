### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Prettier is removing the parentheses around the object literal when it is annotated with a JSDoc `@satisfies` tag. This removal breaks the expected behavior of the code, as the parentheses are necessary for proper intellisense and type checking.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely related to how Prettier determines whether parentheses are necessary around expressions. Specifically, Prettier might be incorrectly identifying that the parentheses are not needed in this context, leading to their removal during the formatting process. This could be due to a lack of consideration for JSDoc annotations or a misinterpretation of the syntax involving `@satisfies`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/language-js/needs-parens.js ---
```
src/language-js/needs-parens.js
function: needsParens
```

The `needsParens` function is likely responsible for determining whether parentheses are necessary around a given AST node. It may need to be updated to consider the presence of JSDoc annotations like `@satisfies`.
