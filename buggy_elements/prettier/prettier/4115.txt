### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when formatting on save is enabled in VS Code with Prettier, it incorrectly adds additional indentation to nested code blocks or raw HTML within Markdown files. This results in the nested content being pushed further out of alignment with each save, breaking the intended indentation structure.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how Prettier handles indentation and formatting for nested content within Markdown files. Specifically, it seems that Prettier is not correctly recognizing the context of the nested content (e.g., HTML within Markdown) and is applying its default indentation rules, which leads to the unintended accumulation of indentation levels.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/doc/doc-printer.js ---
```
src/doc/doc-printer.js
function: generateInd
function: makeIndent
function: printDocToString
```
These functions are involved in generating and managing indentation and formatting documents. The `generateInd` function handles the creation of indentation strings, `makeIndent` is a wrapper for generating indentation, and `printDocToString` processes the document recursively. These functions could be contributing to the incorrect indentation behavior.

#### --- src/doc/doc-utils.js ---
```
src/doc/doc-utils.js
function: mapDoc
function: removeLines
function: willBreak
```
The `mapDoc` function recursively processes document nodes, which could affect how nested content is handled. The `removeLines` function converts lines into spaces, which might interfere with the intended formatting. The `willBreak` function checks for break conditions, which could influence how content is formatted.

#### --- src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js ---
```
src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
function: genericPrint
function: printChildren
function: printLine
function: printTable
```
The `genericPrint` function processes Markdown nodes and applies formatting rules. The `printChildren` function handles the formatting of child nodes, which is crucial for nested content. The `printLine` function decides whether to insert line breaks or spaces, affecting indentation. The `printTable` function specifically handles table formatting, which is relevant to the issue described.

#### --- src/main/ast-to-doc.js ---
```
src/main/ast-to-doc.js
function: genericPrint
function: printAstToDoc
```
The `genericPrint` function in this file also processes nodes from the AST and applies printing logic. The `printAstToDoc` function converts an AST into a formatted document, which could be involved in the overall formatting process.

#### --- src/main/options.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to inferring parsers and normalizing options, which are not directly related to the formatting behavior described in the issue.
