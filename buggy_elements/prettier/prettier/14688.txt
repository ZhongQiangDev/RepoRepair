### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Prettier is removing the trailing comma in the generic type parameter list of a function declaration in `.mts` files. This is problematic because the TypeScript compiler requires the trailing comma for type parameters in `.mts` or `.cts` files to avoid a syntax error.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how Prettier handles trailing commas in generic type parameter lists. Specifically, Prettier's formatting rules may not be correctly configured or implemented to preserve the trailing comma in `.mts` files, which is necessary for TypeScript's syntax requirements.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/language-js/printer-estree.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/language-js/parse/typescript.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/language-js/print/type-parameters.js`

```
src/language-js/print/type-parameters.js
function: printTypeParameters
```

The `printTypeParameters` function is responsible for formatting type parameters in TypeScript code. It needs to be examined to ensure it correctly handles trailing commas in generic type parameter lists, especially for `.mts` files.

#### `src/language-js/utils/index.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/main/range-util.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary

The relevant function that needs to be inspected or edited to fix the problem is:

```
src/language-js/print/type-parameters.js
function: printTypeParameters
```
