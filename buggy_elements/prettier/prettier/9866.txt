### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the JSX formatting is unstable when using the `\u3000` (ideographic space) character. Specifically, the formatting changes inconsistently between runs, which is unexpected. The expected behavior is that the formatting should be stable and consistent across multiple runs.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to be related to how Prettier handles the `\u3000` character within JSX expressions. The inconsistency in formatting suggests a problem with how Prettier processes and formats this specific character in the context of JSX. This could be due to a bug in the handling of Unicode characters or a specific edge case in the JSX formatting logic.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/language-js/embed.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/language-js/printer-estree.js`

```
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
function: printJSXElement
function: printJSXChildren
function: printJSXWhitespaceExpression
```

These functions are responsible for printing JSX elements and handling whitespace within JSX. The issue might be related to how these functions handle the `\u3000` character.

#### `src/language-js/utils.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/main/ast-to-doc.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/main/core.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary

The relevant functions are located in `src/language-js/printer-estree.js`:

```
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
function: printJSXElement
function: printJSXChildren
function: printJSXWhitespaceExpression
```

These functions are likely involved in the unstable formatting behavior when handling the `\u3000` character within JSX.
