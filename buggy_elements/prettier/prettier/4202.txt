### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that Prettier is not limiting the length of lines in markdown tables, especially when processing tables containing HTML content. This results in excessively long lines, as shown in the example where a line reaches 865 characters. The desired behavior is for Prettier to detect such cases and fall back to using a simple three-dash pattern (`:---:`) for table separators instead of generating long lines.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how Prettier processes and formats markdown tables. Specifically, it seems that Prettier is not checking the length of the lines it generates during the table formatting process. When it encounters a table with complex content (like HTML), it attempts to normalize the table by aligning the columns, which can result in very long lines if the content is extensive. The lack of a mechanism to detect and handle excessively long lines leads to this issue.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/main/comments.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/main/multiparser.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/main/options-normalizer.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/main/options.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/main/parser.js`

This file contains relevant functions:

```
src/main/parser.js
function: parse
```

The `parse` function is responsible for parsing the input text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). While it does not directly handle the formatting of markdown tables, it is part of the process that generates the AST which is later used for formatting. If the AST generation does not account for line length limits, it could contribute to the issue.

#### `src/main/multiparser.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/main/parser.js
function: parse
```

The `parse` function is relevant because it is part of the process that generates the AST used for formatting. Although it does not directly handle the formatting of markdown tables, ensuring that the AST generation process considers line length limits could help address the issue. However, further investigation into the specific functions that handle markdown table formatting would be necessary to fully resolve the problem.
