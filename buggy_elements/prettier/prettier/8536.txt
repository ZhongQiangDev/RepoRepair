### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a file contains only a directive (`'use strict';`) followed by a new line and then a comment (`// comment`), Prettier ends the file with two newlines instead of one. The expected behavior is to have only a single newline at the end of the file.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prettier handles the formatting of directives and comments. Specifically, the problem might be related to how Prettier determines the final newline at the end of the file. The extra newline could be introduced due to the way comments are attached or formatted, or due to the handling of the directive itself.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/language-js/printer-estree.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/main/ast-to-doc.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/main/comments.js ---
```
src/main/comments.js
function: printComments
function: printLeadingComment
function: printTrailingComment
```

The `printComments`, `printLeadingComment`, and `printTrailingComment` functions are relevant because they handle the formatting of comments, which could be contributing to the extra newline issue.

#### --- src/main/core.js ---
```
src/main/core.js
function: coreFormat
function: attachComments
```

The `coreFormat` function is responsible for the overall formatting process, including handling newlines, and `attachComments` manages how comments are attached to the AST, which could affect the final newline.

#### --- src/utils/line-column-to-index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Functions/Classes

The relevant functions and classes that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
src/main/comments.js
function: printComments
function: printLeadingComment
function: printTrailingComment

src/main/core.js
function: coreFormat
function: attachComments
```
