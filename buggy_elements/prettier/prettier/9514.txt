### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the GitHub problem description is that the current JavaScript parser used by Prettier (Babylon) is slower compared to Cherow. The goal is to improve the speed of Prettier by replacing Babylon with Cherow, which is reported to be about 40% faster based on the provided benchmark.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the slower performance is the use of Babylon as the JavaScript parser. Babylon is slower than Cherow, which results in slower parsing times for Prettier. Since parsing is a significant part of the formatting process, improving the parser's speed can significantly enhance Prettier's overall performance.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/language-js/parser-babel.js`

This file contains functions related to the current Babylon parser. Since the goal is to replace Babylon with Cherow, the following functions need to be inspected and potentially modified:

```
src/language-js/parser-babel.js
function: createParse
function: babelOptions
function: parseJson
```

#### `src/language-js/parser-flow.js`

This file contains the Flow parser, which is not directly related to the Babylon parser. However, since Cherow does not yet support Flow syntax, this file may need to be updated if Cherow is integrated. For now, it is not directly relevant:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/language-js/parser-typescript.js`

This file contains the TypeScript parser, which is not directly related to the Babylon parser. However, similar to the Flow parser, it may need updates if Cherow is integrated. For now, it is not directly relevant:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/main/core.js`

This file contains core formatting functions that rely on the parser. Since the parser is being replaced, these functions may need to be updated to work with Cherow:

```
src/main/core.js
function: coreFormat
function: format
function: parse
```

#### `src/main/parser.js`

This file contains functions for resolving and using parsers. Since the goal is to replace Babylon with Cherow, these functions need to be updated to support Cherow:

```
src/main/parser.js
function: getParsers
function: parse
function: resolveParser
```
