### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `Tabs` component incorrectly using the `<nav>` element and the `role="navigation"` attribute. This leads to accessibility issues, as it introduces unnecessary navigation landmarks that can confuse screen reader users. The component should not impose these roles or elements, as they should be controlled by the page designer, not the component itself.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the inclusion of the `role="navigation"` attribute and the `<nav>` element in the `Tabs` component's implementation. This is likely due to previous attempts to fix the issue that were either incomplete or reintroduced in subsequent changes. The `role` prop in the `Tabs` component allows users to accidentally set the `navigation` role, which should not be an option.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js`

This file contains the Storybook configuration for the `Tabs` component. It includes a `role` prop that is set to `'navigation'` by default, which is incorrect. This needs to be removed.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js`

This file contains the main `Tabs` component implementation. It includes the `role` prop, which should not be present. The `<nav>` element and the `role="navigation"` attribute should also be removed.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.Skeleton.js`

This file contains the `TabsSkeleton` component, which is a placeholder for the `Tabs` component. It does not seem to be directly related to the issue described.
