### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the VoiceOver screen reader reads the dropdown items twice when navigating through the dropdown menu using keyboard navigation. This issue violates the WCAG 2.1 checkpoint related to information and relationships, as it can confuse users relying on screen readers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the accessibility attributes (ARIA roles, states, and properties) are set up for the dropdown and its items. If the screen reader encounters multiple elements with the same or overlapping roles and states, it may read the content multiple times. This could be due to:

- Incorrect or redundant ARIA attributes on the dropdown or its items.
- Multiple focusable elements within the dropdown that are not properly managed.
- Incorrect use of `role="listbox"` and `role="option"` in the ListBox components.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown-story.js`

This file contains storybook configurations for the Dropdown component and does not directly handle the rendering or accessibility of the component. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`

This file contains the main `Dropdown` component, which is responsible for rendering the dropdown and managing its accessibility. The following functions and classes are relevant:

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
function: Dropdown
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js`

This file contains the `ListBoxMenu` component, which is responsible for rendering the menu container for the dropdown items. The following functions and classes are relevant:

```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js
function: ListBoxMenu
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js`

This file contains the `ListBoxMenuItem` component, which is responsible for rendering individual items within the dropdown menu. The following functions and classes are relevant:

```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
function: Dropdown

packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js
function: ListBoxMenu

packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
function: function_1
```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to ensure that the ARIA roles, states, and properties are correctly set up to prevent the VoiceOver from reading the dropdown items twice.
