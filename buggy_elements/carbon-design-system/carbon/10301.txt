### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the icon-only `Tabs` and `ContainedTabs` variants should support two sizes: `40px` as the default and `48px` as the large size. The provided image shows that the current implementation only supports the `40px` size for the default variant and does not have a large variant at `48px`. This means the large size is missing, and the default size might need to be configurable.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a size prop in the `Tabs` and `ContainedTabs` components. The components currently do not have a mechanism to accept a size prop that would allow them to render in either the default `40px` size or the large `48px` size. This requires adding a size prop to the components and updating the relevant styles and logic to accommodate the new size.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js`

This file contains storybook configurations for the `Tabs` component. It does not directly handle the rendering logic or styling of the `Tabs` component. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue of adding a size prop. However, after adding the size prop, this file will need to be updated to demonstrate the new sizes in the storybook.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js`

This file contains the `Tabs` class, which is the main component that needs to be updated to support the new size prop. The class will need to accept a `size` prop and use it to apply the correct styles.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/Tabs.js`

This file contains a newer version of the `Tabs` component implemented as a function component. Similar to the `Tabs` class, this function will need to accept a `size` prop and use it to apply the correct styles.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/Tabs.js
function: Tabs
```

#### Other Files

The other functions (`function_1` to `function_9`) in the `Tabs-story.js` file are related to storybook configurations and do not directly handle the rendering logic or styling of the `Tabs` component. Therefore, they are not directly relevant to the issue of adding a size prop.
