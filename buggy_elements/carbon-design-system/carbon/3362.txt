### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `FileUploaderButton` component has a DAP (Dynamic Accessibility Profile) violation. Specifically, the `label` element within the `FileUploaderButton` has a `role` attribute that does not reference a valid WAI-ARIA role. This causes accessibility issues.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is the presence of the `role` attribute on the `label` element within the `FileUploaderButton` component. According to the DAP violation message, elements that use the `role` attribute must reference a valid WAI-ARIA role. Since the `role` attribute is not necessary for the `label` element in this context, removing it will resolve the accessibility issue.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader.js
class: FileUploaderButton
```

The `FileUploaderButton` class is relevant because it is the component that is causing the DAP violation. The `role` attribute is likely being set within this class.
