### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the following issues within the `OverflowMenu` component:

- The `focusable="false"` attribute is applied to a `span` element, which is not appropriate since `span` elements do not support the `focusable` attribute.
- The `tabindex="0"` attribute is applied to a `button` element, which is redundant because buttons are focusable by default and are already included in the tab order.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues is likely due to the default values set within the `OverflowMenu` component in the `carbon-components-react` library. Specifically:

- The `focusable="false"` attribute is set as a default value for certain elements within the `OverflowMenu` component, even though it is not necessary or appropriate for `span` elements.
- The `tabindex="0"` attribute is also set as a default value for `button` elements, which is redundant since buttons are inherently focusable.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

The `OverflowMenu` class is relevant because it is where the default values for `focusable` and `tabindex` are set. The issue is likely located within this class.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
