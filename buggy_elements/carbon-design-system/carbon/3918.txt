### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an `OverflowMenu` is used inside a `DataTable`, the keyboard navigation does not work as expected. Specifically, there are no visual indicators (such as focus outlines or highlights) to show which `OverflowMenuItem` is currently active when navigating with arrow keys. This makes it impossible for users to select an option using only the keyboard.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the `OverflowMenu` and `OverflowMenuItem` components handle keyboard events and focus states when they are nested inside a `DataTable`. The `DataTable` might be interfering with the focus management or event propagation, preventing the `OverflowMenu` from correctly applying visual styles to the active `OverflowMenuItem`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `DataTable` class manages the table's data and state but does not directly handle the `OverflowMenu` or its items. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarAction.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TableToolbarAction` function is a wrapper for `OverflowMenuItem` but does not manage keyboard navigation or focus styles.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarMenu.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TableToolbarMenu` function wraps the `OverflowMenu` but does not handle keyboard navigation or focus styles.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
function: function_4
class: OverflowMenu
```
The `OverflowMenu` class manages the menu's open/close state and handles keyboard interactions. The `function_4` function wraps the `OverflowMenu` component and forwards refs, which might be relevant for focus management.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js
class: OverflowMenuItem
```
The `OverflowMenuItem` class handles user interactions, including keyboard navigation and focus states. It is directly responsible for applying visual styles to the active item, making it a key component to inspect.
