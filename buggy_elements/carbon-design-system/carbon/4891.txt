### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the cancel search icon button's color contrast is insufficient when the background color changes to `skyblue` due to Chrome's autofill feature. This makes the icon less visible and potentially inaccessible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is likely related to the styling of the cancel search icon button. The button's color is not dynamically adjusting to maintain sufficient contrast when the background color changes to `skyblue`. This could be due to hardcoded color values or missing CSS rules that handle color contrast adjustments based on background color changes.
