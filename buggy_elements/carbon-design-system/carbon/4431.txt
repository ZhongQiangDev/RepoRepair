### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the project requires an alternative styling for the Tabs component. The provided image shows a design with a blue underline and a different visual style compared to the current implementation. The issue is that the current Tabs component does not match the desired design.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the current Tabs component does not have the necessary styling to match the design shown in the image. This likely involves missing CSS styles and possibly some structural changes in the HTML/JSX to accommodate the new design. The current implementation may not have the required classes or styles to achieve the blue underline and other visual elements.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/components/src/components/tabs/tabs.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The provided information is about a utility function `toArray` and a `Tab` class that seems to be related to a different context (ContentSwitcher). It does not appear to be directly related to the styling of the Tabs component.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
class: Tab
```
The `Tab` class is relevant because it is responsible for rendering individual tabs. The class manages the styling and state of each tab, so it will need to be updated to include the new styling.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TabContent/TabContent.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `TabContent` component is responsible for rendering the content of the selected tab, but it does not directly affect the styling of the tabs themselves.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The functions in this file are related to configuring and testing the Tabs component in a storybook environment. They do not directly affect the styling of the Tabs component.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```
The `Tabs` class is relevant because it is the main component that manages the tabs. It is responsible for rendering the tabs and handling their interactions. The class will need to be updated to include the new styling and possibly some structural changes to accommodate the new design.
