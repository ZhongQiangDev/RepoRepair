### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `onChange` event is not being fired for the `SelectableTile` component, while `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` events are being triggered. According to the documentation and expected behavior, `onChange` should be fired when the selection state of the tile changes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `onChange` event is being handled within the `SelectableTile` component. The `SelectableTile` component should update its internal state when the selection changes and then call the `onChange` prop with the new state. If `onChange` is not being fired, it suggests that either the state update logic is not working correctly, or the `onChange` prop is not being called at all.

The `SelectableTile` class is directly related to the issue. The `onChange` event should be triggered when the selection state changes. We need to inspect the `handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`, and `handleOnChange` methods within this class to ensure they correctly update the state and call the `onChange` prop.
