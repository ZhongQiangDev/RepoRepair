### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `RadioButton` component needs to support a read-only state. The current implementation lacks a `readOnly` prop and the associated styles for this state. Additionally, the playground controls and default story for the read-only state are missing, and RTL tests for the read-only class are required.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of the `readOnly` prop in the `RadioButton` component and the lack of corresponding styles, playground controls, a default story, and RTL tests. This means the component cannot be used in a read-only mode as specified in the acceptance criteria.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js`

This file contains the `RadioButton` component, which needs to be updated to include the `readOnly` prop and the associated styles.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
function: RadioButton
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.Skeleton.js`

This file contains the `RadioButtonSkeleton` class, which is not directly related to the read-only state of the `RadioButton` component. However, it might need to be updated if the skeleton state should also reflect the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.Skeleton.js
class: RadioButtonSkeleton
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js`

This file contains the stories for the `RadioButton` component. It needs to be updated to include a default story for the read-only state and playground controls for the `readOnly` prop.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js`

This file contains the `RadioButtonGroup` component, which is not directly related to the read-only state of the `RadioButton` component. However, it might need to be updated if the group should also reflect the read-only state of its children.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
function: RadioButtonGroup
```
