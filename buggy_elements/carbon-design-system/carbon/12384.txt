### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `NumberInput` component needs to support a read-only state. The current implementation lacks the necessary functionality and styling for this state. The acceptance criteria specify that a `readOnly` prop should be added, along with the appropriate styles and controls in the playground.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of the `readOnly` prop and its corresponding logic in the `NumberInput` component. Additionally, the styles for the read-only state are missing, and there are no controls or stories in the playground to demonstrate this state.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js ---
This file contains the main `NumberInput` component, which needs to be updated to include the `readOnly` prop and its logic.

This file contains the skeleton component for the `NumberInput`, which is not directly related to the read-only state.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.stories.js ---
This file contains the stories for the `NumberInput` component, which need to be updated to include a story for the read-only state.

```

function: function_2
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/util.js ---
This file contains utility functions for text input components, which are not directly related to the `NumberInput` component's read-only state.
