### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem involves two main issues:

1. **SideNav does not close when a `SideNavLink` is clicked**: When a user clicks on a `SideNavLink`, the content loads into the content area, but the SideNav remains expanded instead of closing as expected.
2. **SideNav does not close when clicking outside of it**: The user must click the `HeaderMenuButton` to close the SideNav. Clicking on the overlay or the menu bar does not close the SideNav as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues likely stems from the following:

1. **Lack of SideNav closure on `SideNavLink` click**: The `SideNavLink` component does not trigger the closure of the SideNav when clicked. This suggests that the `SideNavLink` component is not connected to the state management of the SideNav's expanded/collapsed state.
2. **Lack of SideNav closure on click outside**: The SideNav does not have a mechanism to detect clicks outside of it and close accordingly. This suggests that there is no event listener or component that handles clicks outside the SideNav to toggle its state.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `HeaderContainer.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
function: function_1
```
The `HeaderContainer` component manages the state of the SideNav's expanded/collapsed state. It provides the `onClickSideNavExpand` handler to toggle the state. This function is relevant because it manages the state that needs to be updated when the SideNav should close.

#### `HeaderMenuButton.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenuButton.js
function: function_1
```
The `HeaderMenuButton` component is responsible for toggling the SideNav's state when clicked. This function is relevant because it is the primary mechanism for toggling the SideNav's state, but it may not be the only place where the state should be toggled.

#### `SideNav.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
function: SideNav
```
The `SideNav` component manages its own expanded state and provides the `onToggle` callback for toggling the state. This function is relevant because it is responsible for rendering the SideNav and handling its state.

#### `SideNavLink.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavLink.js
function: SideNavLink
```
The `SideNavLink` component is responsible for rendering the links within the SideNav. This function is relevant because it needs to be modified to trigger the closure of the SideNav when clicked.

#### `ClickListener.js`
```
packages/react/src/internal/ClickListener.js
class: ClickListener
```
The `ClickListener` class is designed to handle click events outside of a specified child element. This class is relevant because it can be used to detect clicks outside the SideNav and trigger its closure.
