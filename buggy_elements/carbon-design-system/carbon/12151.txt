### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the fluid text input component is missing a skeleton state. The skeleton state is a visual representation used to indicate that content is loading, which enhances the user experience by providing a placeholder while the actual content is being fetched.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the `TextInput` component, which is part of the fluid form, does not currently include a skeleton state. This means that when the text input is in a loading state, there is no visual feedback to the user, which can lead to a poor user experience.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/FluidForm/FluidForm.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
function: TextInput
```
The `TextInput` function is the main component responsible for rendering the text input field. To add a skeleton state, modifications will need to be made to this function to conditionally render the skeleton state when the input is loading.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in this file is the `TextInputSkeleton` component, which is responsible for rendering the skeleton state for the text input. This component will be used in the `TextInput` component to display the skeleton state.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/util.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TextInput/next/TextInput.stories.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
