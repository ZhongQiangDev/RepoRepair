### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the page selector in the `Pagination` component becomes unsuitable when there are many pages. Specifically, the page selector is a `Select` component that displays a dropdown list of page numbers. When there are many pages, this dropdown list becomes excessively long, extending beyond the visible area of the browser window, requiring users to scroll up and down to find and select the desired page. This results in a poor user experience.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the use of a `Select` component for page selection in the `Pagination` component. When the number of pages is large, the dropdown list generated by the `Select` component becomes impractical for users to navigate. A more suitable approach would be to allow users to directly input the page number using a `TextInput` or `NumberInput` component, which would provide a more efficient and user-friendly way to navigate to a specific page.
