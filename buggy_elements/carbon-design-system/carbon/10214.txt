### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `id` prop is not being applied to the `<th>` element for sortable table headers. Instead, the `...rest` props (which include the `id`) are being spread onto the inner `<button>` element, which is not the intended behavior. This results in A11y issues since the `id` is not set on the `<th>` element as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is in the `TableHeader.js` file, specifically in the rendering logic for sortable headers. When a header is sortable, the `...rest` props are spread onto the `<button>` element instead of the `<th>` element. This is evident from the code snippet provided, where the `...rest` props are applied to the `<button>` element at line 116, but not to the `<th>` element at line 102.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
function: TableHeader
```

The `TableHeader` function is relevant because it contains the rendering logic for the table headers, both sortable and non-sortable. The issue described in the GitHub problem description is directly related to the rendering logic within this function.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
function: TableHeader
```

The `TableHeader` function in `TableHeader.js` is the primary location that needs inspection and editing to fix the problem. Specifically, the `...rest` props should be spread onto the `<th>` element instead of the `<button>` element for sortable headers.
