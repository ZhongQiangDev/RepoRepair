### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after searching for specific items in the data table using the search toolbar, clicking the "Select All" checkbox selects all items in the table, not just the filtered items. The expectation is that only the filtered items should be selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the "Select All" functionality is implemented. When the "Select All" checkbox is clicked, it should only select the rows that are currently visible after filtering. However, it seems to be selecting all rows in the original dataset instead of the filtered subset.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`

This file contains the main `DataTable` class, which manages the state and behavior of the data table. The `handleSelectAll` method is likely responsible for the "Select All" functionality. The issue might be in how this method determines which rows to select.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.js`

This file contains the `TableSelectAll` function, which renders the "Select All" checkbox. This component is responsible for triggering the "Select All" action, but the actual logic for selecting rows is likely handled by the `DataTable` class.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarSearch.js`

This file contains the `TableToolbarSearch` component, which handles the search functionality. It filters the rows based on the search input, but it does not directly handle the "Select All" functionality. However, it might be relevant if the filtered rows are not being passed correctly to the `DataTable` component.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarSearch.js
function: function_2
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/state/getDerivedStateFromProps.js`

This file contains the `getDerivedStateFromProps` function, which computes the next state based on the incoming props. It normalizes the rows and headers, but it does not directly handle the "Select All" functionality. However, it might be relevant if the state is not being updated correctly after filtering.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/state/getDerivedStateFromProps.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/tools/filter.js`

This file contains the `defaultFilterRows` function, which filters the rows based on the search input. This function is responsible for determining which rows are visible after filtering, but it does not directly handle the "Select All" functionality.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/tools/filter.js
function: function_1
```
