### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `CodeSnippet` component does not have a disabled state. This means that when the value within the `CodeSnippet` is not yet available, the component should visually indicate that it is disabled and should not be interactable (e.g., no keyboard focus, no copy functionality).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `CodeSnippet` component currently lacks a `disabled` attribute or prop that would allow it to be styled and behave as disabled. Without this attribute, the component always appears enabled, even when the content is not yet available, which can confuse users.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
function: CodeSnippet
```

The `CodeSnippet` function is the main component that needs to be updated to include a `disabled` prop. This prop would control the styling and behavior of the component when it is in a disabled state.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
