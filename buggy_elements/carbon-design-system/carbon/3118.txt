### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem involves two main issues with the React `<ComboBox>` component:

1. **Multiselect Styles Inclusion**: The `<ComboBox>` is including styles that are meant for a multiselect component, which makes it appear broken. This suggests that the styles being applied are not appropriate for a single-select `<ComboBox>`.

2. **Invalid State Selection Icon Positioning**: The icon indicating an invalid state is positioned incorrectly. This suggests a problem with the CSS or layout that controls the positioning of the invalid state icon.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Cause of Multiselect Styles Inclusion:
- The `<ComboBox>` component might be incorrectly applying styles meant for a multiselect component. This could be due to incorrect class names being applied, or the styles being imported incorrectly.

#### Cause of Invalid State Selection Icon Positioning:
- The CSS rules for positioning the invalid state icon might be incorrect or missing. This could be due to incorrect CSS properties being applied, or the icon being rendered in the wrong place in the JSX structure.
