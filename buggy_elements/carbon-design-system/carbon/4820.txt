### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors identified in the GitHub problem description are:

1. **Accessible Name Mismatch**: The accessible name does not match or contain the visible label text.
2. **Contrast Violation**: The contrast of the foreground and background does not meet WCAG AA requirements.
3. **Invalid State Handling**: When the dropdown is marked as invalid, the error message is not properly displayed or styled.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

1. **Accessible Name Mismatch**: This issue likely arises from the `aria-label` attribute not matching the visible label text. The `aria-label` should reflect the text that is visible to users.
2. **Contrast Violation**: This issue is likely due to the color settings for the text and background not meeting the required contrast ratio. This could be due to hardcoded colors or styles that do not adjust based on the component's state (e.g., disabled or invalid).
3. **Invalid State Handling**: The invalid state handling might be incorrect because the `invalid` prop is not being properly applied or the styles for the invalid state are not correctly defined.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown-story.js`

This file contains the storybook configurations for the Dropdown component. It defines the props and how the component is rendered in different states. The functions here are relevant to the problem because they control the props and states of the Dropdown component.

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown-story.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
function: function_5
function: function_6
function: function_8
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`

This file contains the main Dropdown component implementation. The class `Dropdown` is directly responsible for rendering the component and handling its states and props. This class is highly relevant to the problem.

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
class: Dropdown
function: function_1
```
