### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that clicking the "Show Code" button under the "Docs" section of the Notifications component results in the display of irrelevant code, specifically `<FeatureFlags>` tags, instead of the actual code for the Notifications component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a misconfiguration or error in the code generation or rendering process for the "Show Code" button. The code being displayed is not the intended code for the Notifications component but rather some default or fallback code, possibly related to feature flags. This suggests that the code snippet generation logic is either not correctly identifying the relevant component code or is defaulting to a generic template.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/FeatureFlags/index.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` is responsible for adding an inline notification variant and rendering the `InlineNotification` component. This function might be involved in generating the code snippet for the "Show Code" button. If the code snippet generation logic is incorrect, it could result in the display of irrelevant code.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js
function: InlineNotification
```
The `InlineNotification` function is the main component responsible for rendering inline notifications. If the code snippet generation logic is not correctly extracting the relevant code from this component, it could lead to the display of irrelevant code.

#### Other Files
The other files and functions provided do not seem directly related to the code snippet generation for the "Show Code" button. Therefore, they are not relevant to the issue at hand.

### Summary of Relevant Locations
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js
function: function_3

packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js
function: InlineNotification
```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the problem. The code generation logic in `function_3` and the `InlineNotification` component should be reviewed to ensure that the correct code snippet is being generated and displayed when the "Show Code" button is clicked.
