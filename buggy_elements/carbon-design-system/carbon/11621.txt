### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the search icon in the DataTable selection variant is misaligned and looks off when hovered over. The screenshots provided show that the search icon is not properly aligned with the other icons in the header toolbar.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment of the search icon likely stems from CSS styling issues. The problem could be due to incorrect or missing CSS classes, incorrect positioning properties (e.g., `margin`, `padding`, `top`, `left`), or issues with the layout of the parent container. The hover effect might also be causing additional styling changes that contribute to the misalignment.
