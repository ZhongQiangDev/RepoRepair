### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `TableContainer` does not define unique IDs for its `title` and `description` nodes. As a result, these nodes cannot be referenced by the `Table` component using `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attributes. This leads to accessibility issues, as screen readers like JAWS cannot properly label or describe the table, resulting in the table's rows being used for labeling instead.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the lack of unique IDs for the `title` and `description` nodes within the `TableContainer`. Without these IDs, there is no way to associate the `title` and `description` with the `Table` component using ARIA attributes. This results in the screen reader not being able to correctly label or describe the table, leading to a poor user experience for those relying on screen readers.

```

The `TableContainer` function is relevant because it is responsible for rendering the `title` and `description` nodes. To fix the issue, this function needs to generate unique IDs for these nodes and pass them to the `Table` component so that they can be referenced using `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`.
