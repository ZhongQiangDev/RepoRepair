### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the calendar icon in the date picker is clicked, it is impossible to select a date using the arrow keys on the keyboard. However, when the calendar is opened by clicking on the input field, keyboard navigation works as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the date picker handles keyboard events when it is opened via the calendar icon versus when it is opened via the input field. The difference in behavior suggests that the event listeners or focus management might be set up differently depending on how the calendar is opened. Specifically, the focus might not be correctly set on the calendar when it is opened via the icon, preventing the arrow keys from functioning as expected.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
class: DatePicker
```
The `DatePicker` class is likely responsible for managing the date picker's behavior, including how it handles keyboard events and focus. The issue might be related to how the `DatePicker` class initializes and manages the calendar when it is opened via the calendar icon.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/fixEventsPlugin.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/fixEventsPlugin.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in this file defines a Flatpickr plugin that addresses issues with event handling, including arrow key handling. This plugin might need to be adjusted to ensure that arrow keys work correctly when the calendar is opened via the calendar icon.
