### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when two icon-only buttons are placed next to each other, and one is focused (either by clicking or using the Tab key), its tooltip is displayed. If the user then hovers over the second button, both tooltips become visible and overlap each other. This is not the expected behavior, as only one tooltip should be visible at a time.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the tooltip visibility logic. When a button is focused, its tooltip is displayed. However, when the user hovers over another button, the tooltip for the focused button is not hidden, resulting in both tooltips being visible simultaneously. This suggests that the tooltip visibility logic does not properly handle the scenario where a new button is hovered while another is focused.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`

This file contains the `Button` component, which is responsible for rendering the buttons. However, the tooltip functionality is not directly implemented here. The `Button` component may pass props related to tooltips to another component, but it does not manage the tooltip visibility logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js`

This file contains the `Tooltip` component, which is responsible for managing tooltip visibility and positioning. The `Tooltip` class and its methods are likely relevant to the issue described.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
class: Tooltip
function: function_4
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
class: Tooltip
function: function_4
```

The `Tooltip` class and the `function_4` function are relevant because they are responsible for managing tooltip visibility and positioning. The issue likely lies in the logic that determines when tooltips should be shown or hidden, particularly when a button is focused and then another button is hovered.
