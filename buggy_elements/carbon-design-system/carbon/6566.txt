### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the pagination component overflows its container on smaller viewports, making it difficult to view or interact with the pagination controls. The expected behavior is that the pagination should be visible and, if necessary, scrollable within its container.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the overflow issue is likely related to the CSS styling of the pagination component. Specifically, the width of the pagination container may not be properly constrained or the child elements within the pagination may not be responsive to the container's width. This can result in the pagination elements extending beyond the container's boundaries on smaller screens.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily for configuring and displaying stories for the Pagination component in a testing or documentation environment.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```

The `Pagination` class is the main component responsible for rendering the pagination controls. The issue may be related to how the component handles its layout and responsiveness. Specifically, the CSS styles applied to the component and its child elements may need to be adjusted to ensure they fit within the container on smaller viewports.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.Skeleton.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is a skeleton component used to display a loading state for the pagination component.

#### `packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js
function: PaginationNav
```

The `PaginationNav` function is responsible for managing the pagination logic and rendering the navigation controls. While the issue is primarily a styling problem, the `PaginationNav` function may need to be reviewed to ensure it is not contributing to the overflow issue through its layout or rendering logic.

#### Other Functions in `packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js`

The other functions in this file (`DirectionButton`, `getCuts`, `PaginationItem`, `PaginationOverflow`, `translateWithId`, `usePrevious`) are helper functions and hooks that support the `PaginationNav` component. They are not directly related to the overflow issue but may need to be reviewed if changes are made to the `PaginationNav` function.
