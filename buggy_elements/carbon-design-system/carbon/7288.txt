### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the current `onChange` event in the multiselect (dropdown) menu does not provide a way to determine if the user has finished their selection. This leads to issues where rows are disabled immediately when nothing is selected, and the dropdown is closed, which is not the desired behavior. The workaround mentioned in the description is hacky and not ideal.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the lack of an `onMenuChange` event in the multiselect component. The `onChange` event is triggered whenever a selection is made, but it does not indicate whether the user has finished making their selections. An `onMenuChange` event would be triggered when the menu visibility changes, allowing the application to know when the user has finished selecting and the menu is closed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`

This file contains the `Dropdown` component, which is a general dropdown component. While it has an `onChange` event, it does not specifically address the multiselect scenario. However, since the multiselect component might be built on top of this dropdown, it is relevant to consider if any changes here could affect the multiselect.

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
function: Dropdown
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js`

This file contains the `ListBoxMenu` component, which is a part of the dropdown menu structure. It does not directly handle the `onChange` or `onMenuChange` events, but it is part of the menu structure that needs to be considered when implementing the new event.

```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js
function: ListBoxMenu
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect-story.js`

This file contains storybook configurations and examples for the `MultiSelect` component. It does not directly handle the events but is relevant for testing the new `onMenuChange` event once it is implemented.

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect-story.js
function: function_2
function: function_5
function: function_8
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js`

This file contains the `MultiSelect` component, which is the primary component that needs to be modified to include the `onMenuChange` event. This is the most relevant file for implementing the new functionality.

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
function: MultiSelect
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

This file contains the `OverflowMenu` component, which is not directly related to the multiselect dropdown. It is not relevant to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
