### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `hideLabel` prop in the `Toggle` component does not work as expected. Specifically:

- When `hideLabel={true}` is set, the label is not hidden immediately but instead appears on the side of the toggle.
- To truly hide the label, both `hideLabel={true}` and the `aria-labelledby` prop must be set, which is not clearly documented.
- There is a suggestion that `hideLabel` should work independently of `aria-labelledby` to support the `for` attribute on the label for A11Y compliance.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior seems to be:

- The `hideLabel` prop's functionality is tied to the presence of the `aria-labelledby` prop, which is not clearly documented.
- The implementation of `hideLabel` may be checking for the existence of `aria-labelledby` before hiding the label, leading to the unexpected behavior.
- The current implementation may not consider the `for` attribute as an alternative for A11Y compliance, which could be a limitation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
function: Toggle
```
This file contains the `Toggle` function, which is directly related to the issue. The `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` props are parameters of this function, and their interaction needs to be examined.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains the `ToggleSkeleton` class, which is a skeleton version of the toggle switch and is not directly related to the issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
```
This file contains the storybook examples for the `Toggle` component. The examples use the `hideLabel` and `aria-labelledby` props, so these functions may need to be updated to reflect the correct behavior and documentation.
