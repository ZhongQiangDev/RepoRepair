### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves inconsistency in the naming of the `ariaLabel` prop across different Carbon components. Some components accept `ariaLabel` (camelCase), while others accept `aria-label` (kebab-case). This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential accessibility issues, as the React documentation recommends using kebab-case for ARIA attributes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this inconsistency is likely due to historical reasons where different components were developed or updated at different times, leading to variations in prop naming conventions. Additionally, the transition from camelCase to kebab-case for ARIA attributes may not have been uniformly applied across all components.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js ---
This file contains the `Modal` component, which accepts `modalAriaLabel` as a prop. This prop should be refactored to `aria-label` for consistency.

```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
class: Modal
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js ---
This file contains the `OverflowMenu` component, which accepts `ariaLabel` as a prop. This prop should be refactored to `aria-label` for consistency.

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

#### Other Files
The other files mentioned in the 'Relevant Files Information' do not seem to directly relate to the issue of `ariaLabel` vs `aria-label` inconsistency. Therefore, they do not contain relevant functions or classes for this specific problem.
