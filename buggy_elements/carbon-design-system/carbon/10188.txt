### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when an object is returned from the `itemToString` function in the Dropdown component, the title attribute of the selected item in the dropdown displays as `title="[Object object]"`. This issue arises because the `itemToString` function is being used to render the selected item, but it is not properly converting the object to a string or rendering it as a React element.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `itemToString` function is designed to return a string representation of an item, but when an object is returned, it is not being properly handled. The `itemToString` function is being used to set the `title` attribute of the selected item, which expects a string. When an object is returned, it is converted to a string using the default `toString()` method, resulting in `"[Object object]"`.

To fix this issue, the Dropdown component should provide an option to use a different function, such as `itemToElement`, to render the selected item as a React element instead of a string. This would allow for more complex rendering, such as displaying an icon or other custom content.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
function: Dropdown
```

The `Dropdown` function is relevant because it is the main component that needs to be modified to allow for the use of `itemToElement` to render the selected item.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Icon/Icon-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Icon/Icon.js`
