### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Content Switcher component fails to meet the WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast requirement. Specifically, the light grey outline of the unselected tab does not achieve a 3:1 contrast against the background, leading to confusion about the component's identity and functionality. This issue is particularly pronounced in a 2-tab implementation where the unselected tab can be mistaken for a separate button.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the insufficient contrast between the visual elements of the Content Switcher component. The light grey outline of the unselected tab does not meet the required 3:1 contrast ratio against the background, making it difficult for users to distinguish the unselected tab from the background or other elements. This lack of contrast can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the component's purpose and functionality.
