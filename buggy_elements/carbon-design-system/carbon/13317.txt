### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the RadioGroup implementation lacks proper field validation error states. Specifically, the following states need to be implemented:

- **Invalid (error)**: This state should visually indicate that the user input is invalid and display an error message.
- **Warn**: This state should visually indicate a warning condition and display a warning message.
- **Helper text**: This state should display additional helper text to guide the user.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the current implementation of the RadioGroup and its related components does not include the necessary logic and styling to handle these validation states. The components need to be updated to support these states and to conditionally render the appropriate messages and visual indicators based on the state.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js

This file contains the `FormGroup` component, which is responsible for grouping form elements and handling validation states. The `invalid` prop is already present, but it needs to be extended to support the `warn` and `helper text` states.

```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
function: function_1
```

#### packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.stories.js

This file contains storybook examples for the `FormGroup` component. These examples need to be updated to demonstrate the new validation states.

```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```

#### packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js

This file contains the `RadioButton` component, which is part of the RadioGroup. The component needs to be updated to handle the new validation states and display the appropriate visual indicators.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
function: RadioButton
```

#### packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js

This file contains storybook examples for the `RadioButton` component. These examples need to be updated to demonstrate the new validation states.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```

#### packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js

This file contains the `RadioButtonGroup` component, which manages a group of radio buttons. The component needs to be updated to handle the new validation states and pass the appropriate props to the child `RadioButton` components.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
function: RadioButtonGroup
```
