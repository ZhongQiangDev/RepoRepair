### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the batch table actions are clipped off on smaller screens, making the first few items inaccessible. This issue is particularly noticeable on mobile devices or when the screen size is reduced.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the CSS styling and layout of the `TableBatchActions` component. When the screen size is small, the component's width may not be sufficient to display all the batch actions, causing them to be clipped off. This could be due to a lack of proper responsive design or incorrect CSS properties that do not allow the component to adjust its layout based on the screen size.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```
The `DataTable` class is responsible for rendering the table and managing its state. It includes methods for handling batch actions, which may be relevant to the issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js
function: function_1
```
The `TableBatchAction` function is a simple wrapper for a `Button` component. While it may not directly cause the issue, it is part of the batch actions UI and could be relevant if the button styling is contributing to the clipping.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js
function: function_2
```
The `TableBatchActions` function is directly responsible for rendering the batch actions UI. It includes logic for displaying the action list and summary section, which are likely the elements being clipped off on smaller screens.
