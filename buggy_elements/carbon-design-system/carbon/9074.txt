### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components do not currently support supplying a custom `id` to the `legend` element, nor do they allow setting the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `fieldset` element. This is necessary for proper accessibility support, particularly for screen readers, which require explicit linking between the `legend` and `fieldset` via these attributes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the current implementation of the `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components does not accept or handle props that would allow setting a custom `id` on the `legend` or the `aria-labelledby` attribute on the `fieldset`. The components are missing the necessary logic to map these custom attributes to the respective HTML elements.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup-story.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily for Storybook and does not directly affect the component's functionality.

#### packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js

```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in this file is the `FormGroup` component. It needs to be modified to accept a `legendId` prop and apply it to the `legend` element. Additionally, it should accept an `ariaLabelledBy` prop and apply it to the `fieldset` element.

#### packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
class: RadioButtonGroup
```

The `RadioButtonGroup` class needs to be modified to accept a `legendId` prop and apply it to the `legend` element. It should also accept an `ariaLabelledBy` prop and apply it to the `fieldset` element.

### Summary of Locations Requiring Inspection or Editing

1. 
```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
function: function_1
```

2. 
```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
class: RadioButtonGroup
```

These two locations need to be inspected and edited to add support for the `legendId` and `ariaLabelledBy` props, ensuring they are correctly applied to the `legend` and `fieldset` elements, respectively.
