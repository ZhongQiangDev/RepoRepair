### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that VoiceOver, a screen reader, incorrectly announces each tab as "1 of 1" instead of announcing the correct position of the tab within the group (e.g., "1 of 4", "2 of 4", etc.). This issue affects the accessibility of the tabs, as users relying on screen readers cannot accurately understand the tab navigation structure.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the lack of proper ARIA attributes or incorrect implementation of ARIA attributes that specify the position of each tab within the tab group. Specifically, the `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize` attributes should be used to indicate the position of the current tab and the total number of tabs, respectively. If these attributes are missing or incorrectly set, screen readers like VoiceOver will not be able to announce the correct tab position.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### File: `packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js`

This file contains the `Tab` class, which represents a single tab within the tabs navigation system. The issue described is related to the accessibility of the tabs, so we need to check if the `Tab` class includes the necessary ARIA attributes for tab position.

#### File: `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js`

This file contains the `Tabs` class, which manages a set of tabs. The `Tabs` class is responsible for rendering the tabs and handling their interactions. Since the issue is related to the overall tab group, we need to check if the `Tabs` class correctly sets the ARIA attributes for the tab group.
