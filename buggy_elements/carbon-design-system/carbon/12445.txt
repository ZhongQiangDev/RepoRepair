### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the combobox implementation needs to support a read-only mode. The acceptance criteria specify that the component should be coded in `/package/react`, include a prop for read-only mode, apply styles for the read-only prop, provide controls for each state in the playground, include a default story for easy copy and paste, and have RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the combobox does not include support for a read-only mode. This means that the component lacks the necessary prop to enable read-only functionality, the associated styles for the read-only state, and the controls and stories for testing and demonstrating this state. Additionally, RTL tests for the read-only class are missing.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js ---
This file contains the core logic for the ComboBox component. To support read-only mode, the following functions or classes need to be inspected or edited:

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
function: function_5
```

`function_5` is the main function that defines the ComboBox component. It needs to be updated to include a new prop for read-only mode and handle the logic for this state.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js ---
This file contains the stories for the ComboBox component. To support read-only mode, the following functions need to be inspected or edited:

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_12
```

`function_1` and `function_12` are the stories that render the ComboBox component. They need to be updated to include controls for the read-only state and a default story for easy copy and paste.

#### Other Files
The other functions and classes in the provided files do not seem directly related to the read-only mode functionality. Therefore, they do not need to be inspected or edited for this specific issue.

### Summary of Locations That Need Inspection or Editing

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
function: function_5

packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_12
```
