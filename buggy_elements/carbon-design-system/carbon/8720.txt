### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the Carbon Design System lacks a Progress Bar component, which is needed to display the percent-complete status of a long-running process. The current Progress Indicator component is not suitable for this purpose as it is designed for multi-step workflows rather than showing a percentage completion.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is the absence of a Progress Bar component in the Carbon Design System. The Progress Indicator component, which is currently available, is not designed to show a percentage completion status. Instead, it is intended to illustrate the steps in a process like a wizard. Therefore, the Cloud Pak for Data UX team needs a new component specifically designed to display the percent-complete status of a long-running process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- packages/components/src/components/progress-indicator/progress-indicator.js ---
This file contains the `ProgressIndicator` class and related functions. Since the Progress Indicator is not suitable for displaying a percentage completion status, this file does not contain relevant functions or classes for the Progress Bar component.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator-story.js ---
This file contains functions related to the Progress Indicator component's stories in a Storybook environment. Since these functions are specific to the Progress Indicator and not related to a Progress Bar, they are not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.js ---
This file contains the `ProgressIndicator` class and related functions. Similar to the previous file, these functions are specific to the Progress Indicator and not relevant to the Progress Bar component.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressStep.js ---
This file contains the `ProgressStep` function, which is part of the Progress Indicator component. Since this function is specific to the Progress Indicator and not related to a Progress Bar, it is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains the `ProgressIndicatorSkeleton` class, which is a skeleton version of the Progress Indicator component. Since this class is specific to the Progress Indicator and not related to a Progress Bar, it is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain relevant functions or classes for implementing a Progress Bar component. The Cloud Pak for Data UX team will need to create a new Progress Bar component to meet their requirements.
