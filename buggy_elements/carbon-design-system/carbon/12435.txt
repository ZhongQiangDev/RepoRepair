### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the multi-select implementation needs to support a read-only mode. The acceptance criteria specify that the component should be coded in the `/package/react` directory, include a prop for read-only mode with associated styles, provide controls for each state in the playground, include a default story for easy copy and paste, and pass RTL tests for the read-only class on the prop.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the `MultiSelect` component does not include support for a read-only mode. This means that the component does not have a prop to enable read-only behavior, nor does it have the necessary styles or logic to handle this state. Additionally, the playground and stories do not include controls or examples for the read-only mode, and there are no RTL tests for this specific functionality.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the read-only multi-select implementation.

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
function: MultiSelect
```

The `MultiSelect` function is the main component that needs to be updated to include the read-only prop and handle the associated logic and styles.

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.stories.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
function: function_5
function: function_7
function: function_9
```

These functions in the stories file need to be updated to include controls and examples for the read-only mode.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tag/Tag.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the read-only multi-select implementation.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tag/Tag.stories.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the read-only multi-select implementation.

### Summary

The `MultiSelect` component and its associated stories need to be updated to support the read-only mode as specified in the GitHub problem description. The `MultiSelect` function in `MultiSelect.js` and the various story functions in `MultiSelect.stories.js` are the primary locations that require inspection and editing.
