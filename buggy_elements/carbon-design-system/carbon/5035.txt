### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the container tabs do not truncate their text with an ellipsis when the text exceeds the tab's width, unlike the default tabs. The container tabs should display an ellipsis (`...`) at the end of the text if it overflows, similar to the default tabs.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to missing CSS styles or properties that handle text truncation. The default tabs have a style that truncates text and adds an ellipsis when the text is too long, but the container tabs do not have this style applied.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js`

This file contains the `Tab` class, which is responsible for rendering individual tabs. The issue is likely related to the styling of the tab labels. The `Tab` class should have a style that truncates text and adds an ellipsis when the text is too long.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
class: Tab
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js`

This file contains the `Tabs` class, which manages a set of tabs. While this class is responsible for rendering the tabs, the issue is more likely related to the individual `Tab` component's styling rather than the `Tabs` class itself. However, it's possible that the `Tabs` class might need to pass down a prop or style to the `Tab` components.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenuItem.js`

This file contains the `HeaderMenuItem` function, which is unrelated to the tabs component. The `HeaderMenuItem` function is used for header navigation menus and does not affect the tab component's behavior.
