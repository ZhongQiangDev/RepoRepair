### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two main issues:

1. **Role Conflict**: When a `StructuredList` is placed inside an `ExpandableTile`, the tile is rendered as a button. However, buttons cannot have children with roles, which causes an accessibility issue.
2. **`aria-expanded` Attribute Issue**: The `ExpandableTile` cannot have the `aria-expanded="false"` attribute, which is necessary for proper accessibility.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

- **Role Conflict**: The `ExpandableTile` is rendered as a button when it contains non-interactive content. This is likely due to the tile's internal logic that determines whether to render it as a button or a container based on the presence of interactive elements. When a `StructuredList` is placed inside, it contains elements with roles, which are not allowed inside a button.
  
- **`aria-expanded` Attribute Issue**: The `ExpandableTile` component may not be correctly handling the `aria-expanded` attribute, possibly due to a missing or incorrect implementation of the attribute in the component's logic.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/StructuredList/StructuredList.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes directly related to the `ExpandableTile` component or its `aria-expanded` attribute handling.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.stories.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.stories.js
function: function_10
```

The `function_10` (ExpandableWithInteractive) is relevant because it demonstrates the issue with the `ExpandableTile` component and the `aria-expanded` attribute. This function sets up an `ExpandableTile` with interactive content, which is where the problem is observed.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx`

```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx
```

This file likely contains the `ExpandableTile` component, which is central to the issue. The component's implementation would need to be examined to understand how it handles the `aria-expanded` attribute and the rendering of the tile as a button or container.

#### Other Files

The other files in the `Relevant Files Information` section do not appear to be directly related to the `ExpandableTile` component or its specific issues with `aria-expanded` and role conflicts.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.stories.js
function: function_10

packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.tsx
```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issues described in the GitHub problem description.
