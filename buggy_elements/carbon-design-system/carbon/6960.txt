### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that a long single line of text (CRN) in a code snippet does not wrap to multiple lines when using `type="multi"`. Instead, it remains as a single line, even when the height is set, and the text overflows the container.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the CSS styling of the `CodeSnippet` component. When `type="multi"` is used, the component is expected to handle multi-line text, but the current implementation does not include text wrapping. This could be due to missing CSS properties like `white-space: normal` or `word-wrap: break-word` that would allow the text to wrap properly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/components/src/components/code-snippet/code-snippet.js`

This file contains the `CodeSnippet` class, which is responsible for the UI component's behavior. However, the issue described is more related to CSS styling rather than JavaScript functionality. Therefore, this file likely does not contain the direct cause of the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-story.js`

This file contains several functions that demonstrate different configurations of the `CodeSnippet` component. These functions are used for testing and showcasing the component but do not directly affect the core functionality.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js`

This file contains the `CodeSnippet` function, which is the React component responsible for rendering the code snippet. This is where the issue is likely to be found, as it handles the rendering and styling of the code snippet.

```
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
function: CodeSnippet
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.Skeleton.js`

This file contains the `CodeSnippetSkeleton` class, which is a placeholder component for loading states. It is not directly related to the issue of text wrapping in the actual code snippet.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
