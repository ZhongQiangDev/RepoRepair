### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description mentions that inline links should have an underline by default. However, the provided image shows that the inline links do not have an underline in their default (non-hover, non-active, non-focus, non-disabled) state. This indicates that the default styling for inline links is missing the `text-decoration: underline` property.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely a missing or incorrect CSS rule for the default state of the inline link. The CSS rule for the `:enabled` state should include `text-decoration: underline` to ensure that the link has an underline by default.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/components/src/globals/js/misc/toggle-attribute.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Link/Link-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Link/Link.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Link/Link.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `Link.js` is responsible for rendering the `<a>` element. While this function does not directly handle the CSS styling, it is relevant because it is the component that renders the link. The missing underline issue might be related to the CSS classes or inline styles applied to the `<a>` element.
