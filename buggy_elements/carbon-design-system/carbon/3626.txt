### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the rail (side navigation) is collapsed, the submenu remains expanded, causing additional whitespace and an off-looking active state if a submenu item is focused or selected. This results in a poor user experience as the submenu items are not properly hidden when the rail is collapsed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the submenu's expanded state is not being properly synchronized with the rail's collapsed state. When the rail is collapsed, the submenu should also collapse to avoid displaying the submenu items and the associated whitespace. Additionally, the focus state of the submenu items should be managed correctly to ensure that the active state is visually consistent with the collapsed rail.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the described issue. The `HeaderMenu` component is related to the header menu, not the side navigation rail or submenu.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
This file contains the `SideNav` component, which manages the expanded state of the side navigation rail. The `SideNav` component likely needs to ensure that the submenu is also collapsed when the rail is collapsed.

```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
function: SideNav
```

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavFooter.js
This file contains the `SideNavFooter` component, which is responsible for rendering the footer section of the side navigation. While it includes a toggle button to expand/collapse the side navigation, it does not directly manage the submenu's state.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavLink.js
This file contains the `SideNavLink` component, which is used to render individual links within the side navigation. While it handles the active state of the links, it does not directly manage the submenu's expanded state.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
This file contains the `SideNavMenu` component, which renders a collapsible menu within the side navigation. The `SideNavMenu` component likely needs to ensure that the submenu is collapsed when the rail is collapsed.

```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
class: SideNavMenu
```
