### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that VoiceOver does not announce the "On" or "Off" labels when interacting with the toggle component. This issue occurs because the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute is applied to the spans containing the labels, which hides them from screen readers like VoiceOver.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the presence of the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute on the spans that contain the "On" and "Off" labels. This attribute prevents screen readers from announcing the text within these spans. Removing the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute allows the screen reader to correctly announce the labels.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/icon-helpers/src/getAttributes.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to the toggle component, not the icon helpers.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to the actual toggle component, not the storybook configuration.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
class: Toggle
```

The `Toggle` class is responsible for rendering the toggle component. The issue likely stems from how the `aria-hidden` attribute is applied to the labels within this class.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to the actual toggle component, not the skeleton version.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
class: Toggle
```

The `Toggle` class in `Toggle.js` is the primary location that needs inspection and editing to fix the problem. Specifically, the logic that applies the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to the labels should be reviewed and corrected.
