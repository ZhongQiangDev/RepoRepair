### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the current data table does not have a 40px (`md`) row height option. The image provided shows the desired row height of 40px (or 2.5rem) for both the header and body rows. The issue is that the existing table sizes ('compact', 'short', 'tall') do not include this specific row height.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a CSS class or style definition for the 40px (`md`) row height in the existing codebase. The `Table` component in `Table.js` accepts a `size` prop, but it only supports predefined sizes ('compact', 'short', 'tall'). To add the 40px (`md`) row height, we need to:

- Define a new CSS class for the 40px (`md`) row height.
- Update the `Table` component to accept and apply this new size option.
- Ensure that the `TableHeader` and `TableRow` components also support this new size.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js`

This file contains the main `Table` component, which is responsible for rendering the table and applying styles based on the `size` prop. To add the 40px (`md`) row height, we need to update this component.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
function: Table
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBody.js`

This file contains the `TableBody` component, which renders the `tbody` element. While it does not directly handle the row height, it may need to be updated if the row height affects the styling of the `tbody`.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBody.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js`

This file contains the `TableContainer` component, which wraps the table in a container. It does not directly handle row height, so it is not relevant to this issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js`

This file contains the `TableHeader` component, which renders the table header. To ensure the header row also has the 40px (`md`) height, we need to update this component.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
function: TableHeader
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableRow.js`

This file contains the `TableRow` component, which renders the table rows. To ensure the body rows have the 40px (`md`) height, we need to update this component.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableRow.js
function: function_1
```
