### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the checkbox component needs to support a read-only state. The current implementation lacks a `readOnly` prop and the associated styles for this state. Additionally, the playground controls and RTL tests for the read-only class are missing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of the `readOnly` prop in the `Checkbox` component and the lack of corresponding styles for the read-only state. The playground controls and RTL tests also need to be added to ensure the component functions correctly in different scenarios.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.Skeleton.tsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes for implementing the read-only state.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.stories.js`

- `function_1`: This function renders a `fieldset` with `Checkbox` components. It does not directly relate to the read-only state but may need to be updated to include controls for the read-only state in the playground.
- `function_2`: This function renders a `CheckboxSkeleton` component. It is not directly relevant to the read-only state.
- `function_3`: This function renders a `fieldset` with `Checkbox` components and accepts additional properties via the `args` parameter. It may need to be updated to include controls for the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Checkbox/Checkbox.tsx`

- `CheckboxProps`: This interface defines the props for the `Checkbox` component. It needs to be updated to include the `readOnly` prop.
- `function_2`: This function renders the `Checkbox` component. It needs to be updated to handle the `readOnly` prop and apply the appropriate styles.
- `function_5`: This is an empty `onChange` handler. It may need to be updated to handle the read-only state appropriately.
