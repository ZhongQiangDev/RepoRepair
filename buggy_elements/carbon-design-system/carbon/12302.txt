### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `pagesUnknown` prop is set to `true`, the pagination component displays the page number twice: once in the dropdown select element and again as text next to it. This redundancy is not expected and should be fixed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `Pagination` component handles the rendering of the page number when `pagesUnknown` is `true`. Specifically, the component might be rendering both the dropdown select element and the text label for the page number without checking if `pagesUnknown` is `true`. This results in the page number being displayed twice.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js ---
This file contains the main `Pagination` component, which is responsible for rendering the pagination UI. The issue described is likely related to how the page number is rendered when `pagesUnknown` is `true`.

function: Pagination
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains the `PaginationSkeleton` function, which is used to create a skeleton loading state for the pagination component. This is not directly related to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/PageSelector.js ---
This file contains the `PageSelector` function, which is a React component for creating a dropdown menu for selecting pages. This component is likely involved in rendering the dropdown select element for the page number.

```

function: PageSelector
```
