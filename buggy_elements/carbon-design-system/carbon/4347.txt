### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that the current Overflow Menu component does not have a `--light` modifier, which is necessary for better visibility when the menu is displayed on a grey background. The current grey menu on a grey background results in poor contrast and readability.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the lack of a `--light` modifier in the Overflow Menu component's styling. This modifier would adjust the menu's background color, text color, and possibly other visual properties to ensure it stands out against a grey background. The absence of this modifier means the menu's default styling is not suitable for all background colors, leading to poor user experience in certain contexts.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The functions and classes described here are primarily for configuring and demonstrating the Overflow Menu component in a development environment (e.g., Storybook). They do not directly handle the styling or the `--light` modifier.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

The `OverflowMenu` class is the main component responsible for rendering the Overflow Menu. To implement the `--light` modifier, changes would need to be made to this class to conditionally apply different styles based on the presence of the `--light` modifier. This could involve adding a new prop to the component and using it to modify the CSS class names or inline styles applied to the menu.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `OverflowMenuItem` class is responsible for rendering individual menu items, but the issue described is related to the overall appearance of the menu itself, not the individual items.
