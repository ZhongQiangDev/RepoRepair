### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `MultiSelect` component is rendering a button inside another button, which violates the W3C HTML5 specification that states "there must be no interactive content descendant" for a button element. This can cause accessibility issues and confusion for screen reader and keyboard users.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the way the `MultiSelect` component is structured. Specifically, the component is rendering a button (the "Clear Selection" button) inside another button (the main `MultiSelect` button). This nested button structure is not compliant with HTML standards and can lead to accessibility problems.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
function: MultiSelect
```

The `MultiSelect` function is likely responsible for rendering the `MultiSelect` component, including the nested button structure. This function should be inspected and modified to ensure that the "Clear Selection" button is not rendered inside the main `MultiSelect` button.
