### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the toggle component needs to support a `readonly` state. When a toggle is `readonly` and not disabled, it should be readable by screen readers but should not allow the value to be changed. The current implementation does not include this `readonly` functionality.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of a `readonly` prop in the `Toggle` component. This prop is necessary to control the read-only state of the toggle. Additionally, the component needs to handle the `readonly` state appropriately by ensuring that the toggle is not interactive but still accessible to screen readers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js`

This file contains the main `Toggle` component. To implement the `readonly` functionality, the following changes are needed:

- Add a `readonly` prop to the `Toggle` function.
- Modify the `handleClick` function to prevent state changes when the toggle is `readonly`.
- Add styles for the `readonly` state.
- Ensure the toggle is still accessible to screen readers when `readonly`.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js`

This file contains the `ToggleSkeleton` class, which is a skeleton version of the toggle switch. Since this is a loading state placeholder, it is not directly related to the `readonly` functionality.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js`

This file contains storybook stories for the `Toggle` component. To support the `readonly` state, the following changes are needed:

- Add a story for the `readonly` state in the `Playground` function.
- Ensure the `readonly` state is properly demonstrated in the stories.
