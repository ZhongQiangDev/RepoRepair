### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `iconDescription` for the `TableBatchAction` is being read by JAWS (a screen reader) even when there are visible labels, which is not desired. Additionally, the default value for `iconDescription` is 'Add', which should be an empty string ('') instead.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the way the `TableBatchAction` component is implemented. Specifically, the `iconDescription` prop is being passed to the `Button` component without proper validation or default handling. This results in the `iconDescription` being read by screen readers even when there are visible labels, and the default value being 'Add' instead of ''.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js ---
This file contains the `Button` component, which is used by `TableBatchAction`. The `Button` component has an `iconDescription` prop that is required if `renderIcon` is provided. However, it does not handle the case where `iconDescription` should default to '' when there are no children.

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js ---
This file contains the `Table` component, which is not directly related to the `TableBatchAction` component. Therefore, it does not contain any relevant functions or classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js ---
This file contains the `TableBatchAction` component, which is a wrapper around the `Button` component. It passes all props directly to the `Button` component without any validation or default handling for `iconDescription`.

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js ---
This file contains the `TableBatchActions` component, which uses the `TableBatchAction` component. It does not directly handle the `iconDescription` prop, so it does not contain any relevant functions or classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/stories/with-batch-actions.js ---
This file contains a story for the `DataTable` component with batch actions. It does not directly handle the `iconDescription` prop, so it does not contain any relevant functions or classes.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
