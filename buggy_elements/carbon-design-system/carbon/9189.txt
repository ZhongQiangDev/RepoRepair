### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the overflow in a breadcrumb does not have a shark fin and an offset as expected. This is because the `displayName` is not being set correctly, leading to the incorrect handling of the `OverflowMenu` within the `BreadcrumbItem`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `createComponentToggle` function from `ComponentToggle.js` is being used to conditionally render the `OverflowMenu`. This function wraps the `OverflowMenu` in a `ComponentToggle` component, which changes the `displayName` of the `OverflowMenu` to `"FeatureToggle(OverflowMenu)"`. As a result, the check in `BreadcrumbItem.js` that looks for `children.type.displayName === 'OverflowMenu'` fails, and the correct styling and offset for the overflow menu are not applied.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `BreadcrumbItem.js`
```
packages/react/src/components/Breadcrumb/BreadcrumbItem.js
function: BreadcrumbItem
```
The `BreadcrumbItem` function contains the logic that checks the `displayName` of the `children` to determine if it is an `OverflowMenu`. This check is failing due to the issue described above.

#### `ComponentToggle.js`
```
packages/react/src/internal/ComponentToggle.js
function: createComponentToggle
```
The `createComponentToggle` function is responsible for wrapping the `OverflowMenu` in a `ComponentToggle`, which changes the `displayName` and causes the issue.

#### `OverflowMenu.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `OverflowMenu.js` file does not contain any functions or classes directly related to the issue of the `displayName` being set incorrectly.

#### `OverflowMenu-story.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `OverflowMenu-story.js` file contains functions related to configuring and rendering stories for the `OverflowMenu` component, but it is not directly related to the issue.

#### `Breadcrumb.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Breadcrumb.js` file contains the `Breadcrumb` function, which is not directly related to the issue of the `displayName` being set incorrectly.
