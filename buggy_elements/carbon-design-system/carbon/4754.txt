### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `Accordion` component currently does not have an `align` prop to control the alignment of the chevron icon relative to the heading. The chevron icon is currently aligned at the end of the heading by default, but the user wants the option to align it at the start of the heading.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `Accordion` component and its related components (`AccordionItem`, `AccordionSkeleton`, etc.) do not have a mechanism to accept an `align` prop and adjust the chevron's position accordingly. The chevron's alignment is hardcoded in the component's structure and styling.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion-story.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily for demonstration purposes and does not directly affect the alignment of the chevron.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.js
function: Accordion
```
The `Accordion` function is the main component that wraps the `AccordionItem` components. While it does not directly control the chevron's alignment, it may need to pass the `align` prop down to the `AccordionItem` components.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.Skeleton.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.Skeleton.js
function: AccordionSkeleton
function: AccordionSkeletonItem
```

The `AccordionSkeleton` and `AccordionSkeletonItem` functions are for creating a skeleton loading state but do not affect the alignment of the chevron in the actual `Accordion` component.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js
function: AccordionItem
function: function_1
```
The `AccordionItem` function is where the chevron's alignment is likely controlled. It contains the logic for rendering the chevron icon and the title. The `function_1` (defaultRenderExpando) may also need to be updated if it is used to render the expand/collapse button.
