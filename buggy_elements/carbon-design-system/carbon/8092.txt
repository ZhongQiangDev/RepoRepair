### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `Select` component needs to have a "warning state" added. The provided image shows the expected design for the warning state, including a warning icon and a warning message. Currently, the `Select` component does not support this warning state.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the `Select` component does not have the necessary logic or styling to display a warning state. This includes the absence of a warning icon and the ability to display a warning message. The component currently only supports an "invalid" state, which is different from the warning state.
