### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `TooltipDefinition` component currently only supports `string` values for the `children` prop. When a non-string value, such as a React element (`<h3>Hello</h3>`), is passed as the `children` prop, it results in a console warning indicating an invalid prop type.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `TooltipDefinition` component is currently configured to expect the `children` prop to be of type `string`. This is enforced by the `PropTypes` validation in the `TooltipDefinition.js` file. When a non-string value is passed, the `PropTypes` validation fails, resulting in the console warning.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It is primarily used for storybook documentation and does not directly affect the `TooltipDefinition` component's behavior regarding the `children` prop.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition.js`

This file contains the `TooltipDefinition` component, which is directly related to the issue. The relevant function is:

```
packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function defines the `TooltipDefinition` component and includes the `children` prop. The current `PropTypes` validation for `children` needs to be updated to support other types.

#### `packages/react/src/prop-types/childrenOfType.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It defines a custom prop validator for checking the type of children components, but it is not directly related to the `children` prop validation in the `TooltipDefinition` component.

#### `packages/react/src/prop-types/deprecate.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. It defines a function for deprecating prop types, which is not directly related to the issue at hand.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function in `TooltipDefinition.js` needs to be modified to change the `PropTypes` validation for the `children` prop from `PropTypes.string` to `PropTypes.node` to support other value types.
