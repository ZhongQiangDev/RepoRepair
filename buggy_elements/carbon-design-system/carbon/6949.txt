### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a custom label like "All" is used in the `pageSizes` list, the other labels in the Pagination component display as `NaN`. This occurs because the component expects numerical values for the page sizes, and when it encounters a non-numeric value like "All", it fails to calculate the item range and page range correctly, resulting in `NaN` values.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the Pagination component is not designed to handle custom labels for page sizes. It expects the `pageSizes` prop to be an array of numbers, and it uses these numbers to calculate the item range and page range. When a non-numeric value like "All" is provided, the calculations fail, leading to `NaN` values.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/components/src/components/pagination/pagination.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```
This file describes the `Pagination` class for a non-React environment, which is relevant to the issue described in the GitHub problem.

#### --- packages/components/src/components/pagination-nav/pagination-nav.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file describes the `PaginationNav` class, which is also for a non-React environment and does not directly relate to the issue described.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```
This file contains the React `Pagination` component, which is directly relevant to the issue. The component needs to be modified to handle custom labels for page sizes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
function: function_7
function: function_8
function: function_9
function: function_10
function: Pagination
```
This file contains several functions and the `Pagination` function that are relevant to the issue. The functions `function_7`, `function_8`, `function_9`, and `function_10` are used to format text for item ranges and page ranges, and they need to be updated to handle custom labels. The `Pagination` function is the main component that needs to be modified to accept and handle custom labels for page sizes.
