### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves an accessibility violation where the `FileUploaderDropContainer` component generates a DOM structure that includes an `<input>` element nested inside a `<div>` with the `role="button"`. This violates the WCAG 2.1 checkpoint 4.1.2, which prohibits nested interactive controls as they are not properly announced by screen readers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the improper structure of the DOM generated by the `FileUploaderDropContainer` component. Specifically, the `<input>` element, which is an interactive control, is nested inside a `<div>` with `role="button"`, another interactive control. This nesting is not compliant with accessibility standards and causes the `axe-core` accessibility testing tool to flag a violation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `config/jest-config-carbon/matchers/toHaveNoAxeViolations.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploader.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderDropContainer.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderDropContainer.js
function: FileUploaderDropContainer
```

The `FileUploaderDropContainer` function is responsible for rendering the problematic DOM structure. It needs to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that the `<input>` element is not nested inside a `<div>` with `role="button"`.

#### `packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderItem.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/__tests__/FileUploaderDropContainer-test.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/__tests__/FileUploaderDropContainer-test.js
function: it('should have no axe violations', async () => { ... })
```

This test function is relevant because it is used to detect the accessibility violation. The test should be updated to reflect the changes made to the `FileUploaderDropContainer` component to ensure it passes the accessibility checks.

### Summary of Locations Requiring Inspection or Editing

1. ```
   packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/FileUploaderDropContainer.js
   function: FileUploaderDropContainer
   ```
2. ```
   packages/react/src/components/FileUploader/__tests__/FileUploaderDropContainer-test.js
   function: it('should have no axe violations', async () => { ... })
   ```
3. ```
   config/jest-config-carbon/package.json
   ```
   This file needs to be updated to use a newer version of `axe-core` (â‰¥ 4.2.0) to ensure the accessibility violation is detected.

These locations should be inspected and edited to fix the accessibility issue and ensure the component adheres to WCAG 2.1 standards.
