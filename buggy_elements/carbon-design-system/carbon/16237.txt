### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors identified in the GitHub problem description are:

- The `required` attribute must be specified on each individual `RadioTile` instead of on the `TileGroup`.
- The invisible underlying input for the `RadioTile` is not positioned correctly, causing the validation error message to appear in an unsuitable location.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

- **Cause 1: `required` Attribute on Each `RadioTile`**
  - The `TileGroup` component does not handle the `required` attribute for its child `RadioTile` components. As a result, the `required` attribute must be manually added to each `RadioTile` for native form validation to work correctly.

- **Cause 2: Incorrect Positioning of Validation Error Message**
  - The underlying input element for the `RadioTile` is not positioned correctly within the tile or group. This causes the validation error message to appear in an incorrect location, making it difficult for users to understand which tile is missing a selection.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/RadioTile/RadioTile.tsx ---

This file contains the `RadioTile` component, which is responsible for rendering the individual radio tiles. The incorrect positioning of the validation error message and the need to specify the `required` attribute on each `RadioTile` are likely related to this file.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioTile/RadioTile.tsx
function: RadioTile
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx ---

This file contains the `TileGroup` component, which is responsible for grouping the `RadioTile` components. The inability to specify the `required` attribute on the `TileGroup` is likely related to this file.

```
packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.tsx
function: TileGroup
```
