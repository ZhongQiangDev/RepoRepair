### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `ComboBox` component is generating React warnings due to duplicate keys when rendering `MenuItem` components. This occurs because the `itemToString` function is being used as the key for `MenuItem`, and if multiple items have the same text, they will have the same key, leading to the warning.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `itemToString` function is being used as the key for `MenuItem` components. Since `itemToString` returns the `text` property of an item, if multiple items have the same `text`, they will share the same key, violating React's requirement for unique keys. To fix this, the `id` property of each item should be used as the key instead, as it is guaranteed to be unique.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
class: ComboBox
```

The `ComboBox` class is relevant because it is the main component responsible for rendering the `ComboBox` and its `MenuItem` components. The issue likely lies in how the `ComboBox` assigns keys to `MenuItem` components.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
function: function_1
```

The `ListBoxMenuItem` function is relevant because it is responsible for rendering individual menu items within the `ListBox`. It is where the key for each `MenuItem` is likely being set.
