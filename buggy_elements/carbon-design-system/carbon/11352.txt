### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `IconButton` component has incorrect right padding. Specifically, it appears to be using the padding from the `md` button size instead of the correct padding for an `IconButton`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect right padding likely stems from the `IconButton` component inheriting or applying styles from the `Button` component, which may be using the wrong padding values for the `IconButton`'s specific size. This could be due to incorrect CSS class application, incorrect prop handling, or a sizing convention mismatch.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js ---
This file contains the `Button` component, which is likely used as a base for the `IconButton`. The `Button` component has a `size` prop that controls the button's size and padding. If the `IconButton` is inheriting styles from the `Button` component, the issue might be related to how the `size` prop is being handled or the CSS classes being generated.

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/IconButton/index.js ---
This file contains the `IconButton` component, which is the component with the reported issue. The `IconButton` component wraps the `Button` component and adds a tooltip. The issue might be in how the `IconButton` is passing props to the `Button` component or in the CSS classes it applies.

```
packages/react/src/components/IconButton/index.js
function: IconButton
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js ---
This file contains the `Tooltip` component, which is used by the `IconButton` to display the tooltip. While the tooltip itself is not directly related to the padding issue, it is part of the `IconButton` component and should be examined to ensure it is not affecting the layout.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
class: Tooltip
```

#### Other Files
The other functions and classes mentioned in the provided files do not seem directly related to the padding issue:

- `function_13` in `Button.js` is a validation function and does not affect styling.
- `function_1` and `function_4` in `Tooltip.js` are related to positioning and ref forwarding, not padding.
