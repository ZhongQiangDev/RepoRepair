### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the Slider component needs to support a read-only mode. The current implementation lacks the necessary functionality and styling for a read-only state. The acceptance criteria specify that a new prop should be added for read-only functionality, along with the corresponding styles, controls in the playground, a default story, and RTL tests.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of a read-only prop and its associated logic and styles in the Slider component. The component currently does not handle the read-only state, which means it does not prevent user interaction or apply the appropriate visual styles when it should be in a read-only mode.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.js ---
This file contains the main Slider component, which needs to be updated to include the read-only functionality.

```
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.js
function: defaultFormatLabel
class: Slider
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains the skeleton loading state for the Slider component. It is not directly related to the read-only functionality but should be reviewed to ensure consistency with the new read-only state.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.stories.js ---
This file contains the stories for the Slider component, which need to be updated to include a story for the read-only state.

```
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_14
```
