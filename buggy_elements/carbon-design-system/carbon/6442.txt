### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `ContentSwitcher` component does not visually contrast well on `ui-01` backgrounds. This lack of contrast makes it difficult for users to distinguish the `ContentSwitcher` from its background, potentially leading to usability issues.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the styling of the `ContentSwitcher` component. The current styling may not account for different background colors, specifically `ui-01`. To resolve this, one of two approaches could be taken:
- Adjust the existing tokens (CSS variables or styles) to ensure better contrast on `ui-01` backgrounds.
- Introduce a `light` prop or variant to the `ContentSwitcher` component, similar to the `TextInput` component, which would allow for different styling based on the background color.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js`

This file contains storybook configurations and examples for the `ContentSwitcher` component. While it does not directly handle the styling of the component, it may need to be updated to include a `light` variant in the stories if such a variant is added.

```
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js`

This file contains the `ContentSwitcher` class, which is the core implementation of the component. To address the issue, the class itself may need to be modified to include a `light` prop or variant and handle the styling accordingly.

```
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js
class: ContentSwitcher
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js
function: function_3
function: function_4

packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js
class: ContentSwitcher
```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the problem by either adjusting the tokens for better contrast or introducing a `light` prop/variant for the `ContentSwitcher` component.
