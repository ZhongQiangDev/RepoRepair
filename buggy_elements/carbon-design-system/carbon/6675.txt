### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the pagination footer shows "items" and "pages" in their plural forms even when there is only one item or one page. The expected behavior is to display the singular form ("item" and "page") when the count is one.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the current implementation of the pagination component does not include conditional logic to switch between singular and plural forms based on the count of items or pages. Specifically, the code at lines 148 and 312 in `Pagination.js` does not handle the case where `max === 1` or `totalPages === 1`.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
class: Pagination
```
2. ```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
function: function_7
```
3. ```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
function: function_8
```
4. ```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
function: function_9
```

These locations are relevant because they involve the logic for generating the text that appears in the pagination footer, which needs to be updated to handle singular and plural forms correctly.
