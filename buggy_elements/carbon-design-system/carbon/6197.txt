### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the alignment of the labels in `tall` data table headers is misaligned when sorting is enabled. Specifically, the table header labels do not have the same alignment, as shown in the screenshot provided.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment issue likely stems from the way the `TableHeader` component handles the rendering of sortable headers when the `size` prop is set to `tall`. The problem could be related to how the CSS classes are applied or how the layout is structured when the `isSortable` prop is true and the `size` prop is `tall`.

The `TableHeader` component is responsible for rendering the table headers, including sortable headers. The `function_2` (which is the `TableHeader` component) handles the rendering of the header based on the `isSortable` and `size` props. The misalignment issue could be due to how the CSS classes are applied or how the layout is structured when `isSortable` is true and `size` is `tall`.
