### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the `GitHub Problem Description` is that the Breadcrumb component's skeleton version has a DAP (Digital Accessibility Platform) violation. Specifically, the hyperlinks within the skeleton version of the Breadcrumb component are missing hyperlink labels, which violates accessibility standards.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the `BreadcrumbSkeleton` class in `Breadcrumb.Skeleton.js` creates placeholder items for the breadcrumb skeleton using empty `a` tags with non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`). These `a` tags do not have any meaningful text or alternative text, which leads to the DAP violation. For accessibility, hyperlinks must contain link text or an image with alt text.
