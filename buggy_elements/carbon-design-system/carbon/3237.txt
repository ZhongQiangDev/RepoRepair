### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a Transactional/Passive modal is open, the background (body or parent element) still scrolls. This is not the expected behavior for many users, who would prefer that the background scrolling be disabled when the modal is open.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the absence of a mechanism that disables scrolling on the body or parent element when the modal is open. In frameworks like Bootstrap, this is typically achieved by adding a class (e.g., `modal-open`) to the body element, which applies CSS styles to prevent scrolling. In the context of Carbon Components, a similar approach might be missing.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions or Classes

#### --- packages/components/src/components/modal/modal.js ---
This file contains the `Modal` class, which is responsible for the modal's functionality. Since the issue is related to the modal's behavior when it is open, this file is highly relevant.

```
packages/components/src/components/modal/modal.js
class: Modal
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal-story.js ---
This file contains functions related to the modal's storybook configuration. It does not directly handle the modal's behavior when it is open, so it is not relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js ---
This file contains the `Modal` class for the React implementation. Since it handles the modal's behavior and rendering, it is relevant to the issue.

```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
class: Modal
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ModalWrapper/ModalWrapper.js ---
This file contains the `ModalWrapper` class, which encapsulates a modal dialog and a trigger button. While it manages the modal's open/close state, it does not directly handle the scrolling behavior of the background when the modal is open. However, it might be relevant if it needs to pass down a prop to the `Modal` component to control scrolling.

```
packages/react/src/components/ModalWrapper/ModalWrapper.js
class: ModalWrapper
```
