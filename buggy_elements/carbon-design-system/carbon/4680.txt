### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components, which are subcomponents of the `UIShell`, are displayed as `Anonymous` in the React browser plugin. This occurs because these components are `forwardRef` components that do not have a `displayName` set, making them difficult to identify and debug in development tools.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components are created using `React.forwardRef`, but they do not have a `displayName` property set. When a component is created with `React.forwardRef`, it is typically anonymous unless a `displayName` is explicitly provided. This `displayName` is used by development tools like the React browser plugin to identify the component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/Header.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
function: function_2
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js

```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/UIShell/UIShell-story.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The relevant locations that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
function: function_2

packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
function: function_1
```

These functions create the `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components using `React.forwardRef` and should have a `displayName` set to properly identify them in development tools.
