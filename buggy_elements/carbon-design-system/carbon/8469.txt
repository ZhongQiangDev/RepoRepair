### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `aria-label` provided to the `Toggle` component is not being read by the screen reader (VoiceOver). Instead, the screen reader only reads the `labelText` or the `labelA` and `labelB` props, which are not always visible or accessible to screen readers. This results in the toggle not being properly labeled for users relying on screen readers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `aria-label` attribute is being applied or not applied to the relevant HTML element within the `Toggle` component. The `aria-label` should be applied to the `<input>` element within the `Toggle` component so that it can be read by screen readers. However, it seems that the `aria-label` is either not being applied at all or is being applied to an element that is not being read by the screen reader.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
class: Toggle
```

The `Toggle` class is the primary component responsible for rendering the toggle switch. The issue likely lies within this class, specifically in how the `aria-label` is being applied to the `<input>` element. The `aria-label` should be applied to the `<input>` element so that it can be read by screen readers.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
class: Toggle
```

The `Toggle` class in `Toggle.js` is the primary location that needs inspection and editing to fix the issue. Specifically, the application of the `aria-label` attribute to the `<input>` element within the `Toggle` component should be reviewed and corrected.
