### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that new inverse tokens need to be added for high contrast moments in tooltips, pop-overs, and notifications. Specifically, the tokens `$link-inverse-active` and `$link-inverse-hover` need to be defined for different background colors (White, Gray 10, Gray 90, and Gray 100) to ensure proper contrast and visibility.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is the absence of the required inverse tokens in the existing theme and token configurations. These tokens are necessary to ensure that links within high-contrast elements like tooltips, pop-overs, and notifications are visually distinct and accessible. Without these tokens, the links may not be visible or may not meet accessibility standards.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/themes/src/tokens.js ---
```
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
function: formatTokenName
```

#### --- packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js ---
```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
function: buildThemesFile
```

#### --- packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js ---
```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js
function: buildTokensFile
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
function: formatTokenName
```
2. ```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
function: buildThemesFile
```
3. ```
packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js
function: buildTokensFile
```

These functions are relevant because they are responsible for formatting token names, building theme files, and constructing the Sass AST for tokens, respectively. They will need to be updated to include the new inverse tokens as described in the GitHub problem description.
