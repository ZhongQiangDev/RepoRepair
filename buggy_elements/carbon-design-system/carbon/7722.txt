### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a filterable multiselect component has some options selected, clicking on its `<input>` field results in the focus outline being applied to the wrong node (specifically, the `<input>` field instead of the entire control). This is visually evident from the screenshots provided, where the focus outline is around the `<input>` field instead of the entire multiselect control.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the focus event is handled within the `FilterableMultiSelect` component. When the `<input>` field is clicked, the focus event might be incorrectly applied to the `<input>` field instead of the entire multiselect control. This could be due to improper event bubbling, incorrect focus management, or a misconfiguration in the component's structure or styling.
