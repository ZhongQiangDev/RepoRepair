### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the lack of support for `xl` and `large` button size variants in the current button component. The existing button sizes do not include the `80px` (`xl`) and `64px` (`large`) heights that are needed for the new creation flow pattern and modal consistency.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the current implementation of the `Button` component does not include the `xl` and `large` size variants. The `size` prop in the `Button` component only supports existing sizes like `small` and `field`, but not the new sizes required (`xl` and `large`). Additionally, the relevant story files and other components that use the `Button` component need to be updated to reflect these new sizes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`

This file contains the main `Button` component, which needs to be updated to support the new `xl` and `large` sizes.

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js`

This file contains story configurations for the `Button` component. It needs to be updated to include stories for the new `xl` and `large` sizes.

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.Skeleton.js`

This file contains the `ButtonSkeleton` component, which may need to be updated if the skeleton styles need to reflect the new sizes.

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.Skeleton.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/ButtonSet/ButtonSet.js`

This file contains the `ButtonSet` component, which may need to be updated if the button set needs to accommodate the new sizes.

```
packages/react/src/components/ButtonSet/ButtonSet.js
function: ButtonSet
```

#### Other Files

The other functions and classes listed in the `Relevant Files Information` do not directly relate to the implementation of the `Button` component's size variants. Therefore, they are not relevant to the cause of the problem.
