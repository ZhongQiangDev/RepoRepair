### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `caption` prop is declared in the `ActionableNotification.propTypes` but is not actually used or rendered within the `ActionableNotification` component. As a result, when a user provides a value for the `caption` prop, nothing is displayed in the component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that while the `caption` prop is defined in the `propTypes` for `ActionableNotification`, it is not being passed down or utilized within the component's JSX or logic. This means that even though the prop is accepted, it is not being rendered or processed in any way, leading to the described behavior where the caption does not appear.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js ---

**Relevant Functions/Classes:**
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js
function: ActionableNotification
```

The `ActionableNotification` function is where the `caption` prop should be implemented. Since the `caption` prop is declared in `propTypes` but not used in the component, this function needs to be inspected and edited to include the `caption` prop in the component's rendering logic.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Notification/stories/ActionableNotification.stories.js ---

**Relevant Functions/Classes:**
```
packages/react/src/components/Notification/stories/ActionableNotification.stories.js
function: function_2
```

The `Playground` function in this file is used to demonstrate the `ActionableNotification` component with various props. Since the `caption` prop is not working, this function should be inspected to ensure that it correctly passes the `caption` prop to the `ActionableNotification` component.

#### Other Files

The other functions and classes listed in the "Relevant Files Information" do not appear to be directly related to the issue with the `caption` prop in `ActionableNotification`. Therefore, they do not need to be inspected for this specific problem.

### Summary of Locations That Need Inspection or Editing

1. ```
   packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js

   ```
   
2. ```
