### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that `AccordionItem` from `carbon-components-react` and `Footer` from `@carbon/react` generate duplicate IDs, such as `accordion-item-1`, when used on the same page. This leads to accessibility violations as IDs should be unique within a document.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the duplicate IDs is likely due to the `useId` function in both libraries not sharing the same context or namespace for generating unique IDs. The `useId` function in `carbon-components-react` and `@carbon/react` might be generating IDs independently, leading to collisions when both components are used on the same page.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Accordion/Accordion.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js
function: AccordionItem
```

The `AccordionItem` function uses the `useId` hook to generate IDs for its elements. This is likely where the duplicate IDs are being generated.

#### `packages/react/src/internal/useId.js`

```
packages/react/src/internal/useId.js
function: useId
```

The `useId` function is responsible for generating unique IDs. The issue might be here if the function does not ensure uniqueness across different components or libraries.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
   packages/react/src/components/Accordion/AccordionItem.js
   function: AccordionItem
   ```
2. ```
   packages/react/src/internal/useId.js
   function: useId
   ```

These two locations are directly related to the problem of duplicate IDs. The `AccordionItem` function uses `useId` to generate IDs, and the `useId` function itself might need to be modified to ensure uniqueness across different components and libraries.
