### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that clicking the down arrow icon in the ComboBox component does not trigger the `onClick` function the first time it is clicked. As a result, the AJAX call to populate the list of values does not occur, and the dropdown remains empty. However, clicking the ComboBox input field itself triggers the `onClick` function correctly, populating the list as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the ComboBox component handles click events for the down arrow icon versus the input field. The down arrow icon might not be properly bound to the `onClick` function, or there could be a delay in state updates that prevents the AJAX call from being triggered on the first click. This could be due to event bubbling issues, incorrect event listeners, or state management problems within the ComboBox component.

```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
class: ComboBox
```

The `ComboBox` class is the primary component responsible for rendering the ComboBox and handling its events. The issue described likely involves the event handling logic within this class. Specifically, the `onToggleClick` method might not be correctly triggering the `onClick` function when the down arrow is clicked.
