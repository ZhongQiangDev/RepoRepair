### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves accessibility violations in the React MultiSelect component when using DAP (Dynamic Accessibility Plugin). Specifically:

- The X button used to clear the selection is missing a label, leading to a WAI-ARIA widget with an IMG role missing a nonempty title attribute.
- When the MultiSelect is expanded, there are multiple DAP violations related to grouping roles or elements to identify related form controls and interactive elements/widgets not having an accessible name.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues likely stems from missing or incorrect ARIA attributes and labels in the MultiSelect component. Specifically:

- The X button (clear selection button) lacks a proper label or title attribute, which is necessary for screen readers to identify its purpose.
- The form controls (checkboxes) within the MultiSelect dropdown are not properly grouped, leading to issues with identifying related form controls.
- Interactive elements within the MultiSelect, such as buttons or checkboxes, may not have appropriate accessible names, making them difficult for screen readers to interpret.

```

The `MultiSelect` class is likely responsible for rendering the MultiSelect component and managing its state and event handlers. The issues identified in the DAP violations suggest that the component may need to be inspected for proper ARIA attributes and labels, especially for the X button and form controls.
