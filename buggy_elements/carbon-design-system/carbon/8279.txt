### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user performs a multi-selection using the Shift key, the selected state of the last tile can become out of sync. Specifically, if a tile was previously selected and the user holds the Shift key to select another tile, the previously selected tile may get deselected even though the `selected` prop indicates it should remain selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the `SelectableTile` component handles the selected state when the Shift key is used for multi-selection. The selected state does not respect the `selected` prop value passed in, leading to unexpected deselection of tiles.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

The `SelectableTile` class is directly related to the issue because it manages the selected state of the tile. The problem likely lies in how the `selected` state is updated and synchronized with the `selected` prop.
