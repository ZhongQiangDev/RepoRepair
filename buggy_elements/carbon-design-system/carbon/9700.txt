### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the inputs within the modal are not spanning the full width of the modal. Instead, they are narrower than expected, as shown in the first image. The second image illustrates the desired behavior where the inputs should span the full width of the modal.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from CSS styling that is not correctly applied to the input fields within the modal. The input fields may have a fixed width or padding/margin settings that prevent them from expanding to fill the modal's width. This could be due to incorrect class names, missing CSS rules, or incorrect props being passed to the input components.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal-story.js`

This file contains functions that configure and display the modal in Storybook. While it sets up the modal's properties, it does not directly handle the styling of the input fields. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the direct cause of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js`

This file contains the `Modal` class, which is responsible for rendering the modal and its content. The `Modal` class includes the `children` prop, which is where the input fields are likely rendered. If the input fields are not styled correctly, it could be due to missing or incorrect CSS classes applied within the `Modal` class.

```
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
class: Modal
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js`

This file contains the `TextInput` component, which is used to render the input fields within the modal. The `TextInput` component has various props that control its appearance and behavior. If the input fields are not spanning the full width, it could be due to incorrect props being passed to the `TextInput` component or missing CSS rules within the component.

```
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
function: TextInput
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js`

This file contains the `TextInputSkeleton` component, which is used to display a skeleton loading state for the text input. Since this component is only used for loading states, it is unlikely to be related to the issue of input fields not spanning the full width.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
