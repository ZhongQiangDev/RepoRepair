### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the screen reader cannot read the label text of the radio button in the React version, whereas it can read the label text in the vanilla HTML version. Specifically, the screen reader fails to announce "Radio button label" when interacting with the React component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue appears to be the presence of the `aria-label` attribute in the React-generated HTML. The `aria-label` attribute is set to "Radio button label," which may be conflicting with or overriding the actual label text. In the vanilla HTML, the label text is correctly associated with the radio button via the `for` attribute, which links the label to the input by ID. In the React version, the `aria-label` attribute might be causing the screen reader to ignore the label text.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
class: RadioButton
```

The `RadioButton` class is responsible for rendering the radio button component. The issue likely lies in how the label is associated with the radio button. The `aria-label` attribute might be incorrectly applied, causing the screen reader to not read the label text.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
