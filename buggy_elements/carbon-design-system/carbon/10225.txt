### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the current implementation of `Tabs` does not support an "icon-only" variant for both `Line Tabs` and `ContainedTabs`. The images provided show the desired layout for these icon-only tabs, where the tab content is represented solely by an icon, without any accompanying text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the current implementation of `Tabs` and its child components (`Tab`, `ContainedTab`) does not have the capability to render tabs with only icons. The `label` attribute in the `Tab` and `ContainedTab` components is currently designed to accept any React node, which typically includes text or a combination of text and icons. To support an icon-only variant, the components need to be updated to handle cases where the `label` is an icon or to introduce a new prop specifically for icons.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js`

This file contains the `Tab` class, which is a core component of the tab system. To support an icon-only variant, the `Tab` class needs to be updated to handle cases where the `label` is an icon. This may involve modifying the rendering logic to ensure that the icon is properly displayed and styled.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
class: Tab
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tab/next/ContainedTab.js`

This file contains the `ContainedTab` function, which is used for rendering contained tabs. Similar to the `Tab` class, the `ContainedTab` function needs to be updated to support an icon-only variant. This may involve modifying the rendering logic and handling the `label` prop to ensure that the icon is properly displayed.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tab/next/ContainedTab.js
function: ContainedTab
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js`

This file contains several functions that define the configuration and behavior of the tabs component in a storybook environment. While these functions are not directly responsible for rendering the tabs, they may need to be updated to include examples and configurations for the new icon-only variant.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
function: function_6
function: function_7
```

#### `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js`

This file contains the `Tabs` class, which is the container component for the tab system. While the `Tabs` class itself does not need to be updated to support the icon-only variant, it may need to be modified to handle new props or behaviors related to the icon-only tabs.

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
class: Tabs
```

#### Other Files

The remaining functions in `packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js` (`function_1`, `function_2`, `function_3`, `function_4`, `function_5`, `function_8`, `function_9`) are not directly related to the core tab rendering logic and do not need to be updated for the icon-only variant.
