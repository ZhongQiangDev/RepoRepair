### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the GitHub problem description is that the `TableBatchActions` component currently does not include a "Select all" button next to the `totalSelected` text. The request is to add this feature as an optional inclusion within the component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `TableBatchActions` component does not currently have the functionality to render a "Select all" button. This is likely due to the absence of the necessary logic and UI elements within the component to handle this feature.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.tsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchActions.js
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` in `TableBatchActions.js` is responsible for rendering the batch actions UI. To add the "Select all" button, this function needs to be modified to include the new button and handle its logic.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.tsx ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.tsx
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `TableSelectAll.tsx` is a React component that renders a checkbox for selecting all rows. This component can be reused or modified to create the "Select all" button functionality.
