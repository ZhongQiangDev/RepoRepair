### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the dropdown implementation needs to support a read-only state. The current implementation lacks the necessary functionality and styling for a read-only dropdown. The acceptance criteria specify that a prop for read-only should be added, along with the corresponding styles, and controls for each state should be included in the playground.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of a read-only prop and the associated styles in the `Dropdown` component. The component currently does not handle the read-only state, which is necessary to meet the specified acceptance criteria. Additionally, the playground and stories need to be updated to include controls for the read-only state and a default story for easy copy and paste.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js ---
This file contains the main `Dropdown` component. To support the read-only state, the following changes are necessary:

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
function: Dropdown
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.Skeleton.js ---
This file contains the `DropdownSkeleton` component, which is a placeholder for the dropdown during loading. It does not directly relate to the read-only state of the dropdown.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.stories.js ---
This file contains the stories for the `Dropdown` component. To meet the acceptance criteria, the stories need to be updated to include controls for the read-only state and a default story.

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.stories.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
function: function_5
function: function_7
function: function_11
```
