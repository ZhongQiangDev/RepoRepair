### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the contrast of shadows on dark themes (G90 and G100) for the following components:

- **Overflow menu shadows**: The current opacity levels for shadows on G90 and G100 themes are too low, resulting in poor contrast. The proposal is to either set both to 80% opacity or G90 to 70% and G100 to 80%.
- **Page overlay for Modals**: The current overlay color (#161616) and transparency (70%) for modals in dark themes do not provide sufficient contrast. The proposal is to change the overlay color to #000000 with a transparency of 65%.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely due to the current CSS styles applied to the shadows and overlays in the dark themes. The opacity and color values for these styles are not set to provide adequate contrast, making the components less visible and harder to interact with in dark mode.

The `Modal` class is relevant because it manages the modal component, including the page overlay. The `onRequestClose` and `open` props control the visibility of the modal, and the `className` prop can be used to apply custom styles, including the overlay color and transparency.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

The `OverflowMenu` class is relevant because it manages the overflow menu component, including the shadow. The `menuOffset` and `flipped` props can be used to adjust the position and appearance of the menu, including the shadow.
