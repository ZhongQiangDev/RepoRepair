### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is related to the accessibility of the `ExpandableTile` component when using screen readers like VoiceOver or JAWS. Specifically:

- When entering the web area, the screen reader does not announce the "Above the fold content."
- The screen reader announces the "Expand button main" but does not include the button's label and current state (`aria-expanded=false`).
- The "Below the fold content" is announced even when the tile is not expanded, which should only be announced after the tile is expanded.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues seem to stem from the following potential causes:

- **Missing or Incorrect ARIA Attributes**: The `ExpandableTile` component may not be correctly using ARIA attributes like `aria-expanded` and `aria-labelledby` to inform screen readers about the state of the tile and its content.
- **Incorrect Focus Management**: The focus may not be correctly managed when entering the web area or when interacting with the expandable content.
- **Incorrect Announcement of Content**: The "Below the fold content" is announced prematurely, which suggests that the content's visibility or accessibility state is not being properly controlled.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js ---

```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js
class: ExpandableTile
class: TileAboveTheFoldContent
class: TileBelowTheFoldContent
```

**Explanation**:
- **ExpandableTile**: This class is directly responsible for managing the expandable behavior of the tile. It should ensure that the `aria-expanded` attribute is correctly set and that the content's visibility is controlled based on the tile's state. It also needs to manage focus and keyboard interactions properly.
- **TileAboveTheFoldContent**: This class wraps the content that should be immediately visible. It needs to ensure that this content is correctly announced by screen readers when the tile is first rendered.
- **TileBelowTheFoldContent**: This class wraps the content that should only be visible and announced when the tile is expanded. It needs to ensure that this content is not announced prematurely.
