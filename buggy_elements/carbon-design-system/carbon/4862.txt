### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is a violation of IBM 2.5.3 Label in Name for the `DataTable` component when used with a `Toolbar`. Specifically, the accessible name of an element does not match or contain the visible label text, as indicated by the DAP (Digital Accessibility Platform) scan results.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this violation is likely related to how the `DataTable` component interacts with the `Toolbar` component. Specifically, the issue may arise from how the `Toolbar` component's buttons or other interactive elements are labeled and how these labels are exposed to assistive technologies. The `Toolbar` component may not be correctly setting the `aria-label` or other relevant ARIA attributes for its elements, leading to a mismatch between the accessible name and the visible label text.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to the `DataTable` and `Toolbar` components, not the `Button` component.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```
The `DataTable` class is relevant because it is the component where the violation is observed. The issue may be related to how the `DataTable` component integrates with the `Toolbar` component and how it manages the accessible names of its elements.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Toolbar/Toolbar.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Toolbar/Toolbar.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: function_4
function: function_5
```
The `Toolbar` component and its related functions are relevant because they are responsible for rendering the toolbar elements that may be causing the accessibility violation. Specifically, `function_1` (the `Toolbar` component), `function_2` (the `ToolbarItem` component), `function_3` (the `ToolbarTitle` component), `function_4` (the `ToolbarOption` component), and `function_5` (the `ToolbarDivider` component) may need to be inspected to ensure they correctly set ARIA attributes and accessible names.
