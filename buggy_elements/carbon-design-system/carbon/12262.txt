### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior identified in the GitHub problem description is that the data table component is missing an `id` element, which affects accessibility. Specifically, the IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker flags a table component as needing an `id` element, and the `headers` attribute value "expand" does not reference a valid `id` in the document.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a unique `id` attribute on the table header or row elements that the `headers` attribute is supposed to reference. The `headers` attribute is used to associate table cells with their respective headers, which is crucial for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the table structure. If the `headers` attribute points to an `id` that does not exist, it breaks the association and affects accessibility.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Table` component does not directly handle the `headers` attribute or the `id` elements. It is more focused on the overall structure and styling of the table.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TableContainer` component is responsible for wrapping the table and providing a container with optional title and description. It does not handle the `headers` attribute or `id` elements directly.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableExpandHeader.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TableExpandHeader` component handles the expand/collapse functionality for table headers but does not directly manage the `headers` attribute or `id` elements.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableExpandRow.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `TableExpandRow` component manages the expandable rows but does not directly handle the `headers` attribute or `id` elements.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
function: TableHeader
```
The `TableHeader` component is responsible for rendering table header cells (`<th>`). It is likely that this component needs to be modified to ensure that each header cell has a unique `id` attribute, which can then be referenced by the `headers` attribute in the table cells (`<td>`). The `TableHeader` component should be inspected and edited to add the necessary `id` attributes and ensure they are correctly referenced.
