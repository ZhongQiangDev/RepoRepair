### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `OverflowMenu` component is emitting a warning about the deprecated `light` prop, even though the `light` prop is not explicitly set in the code. The warning message suggests that the `light` prop is no longer needed and will be removed in the next major release, recommending the use of the `Layer` component instead.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The warning is likely being triggered because the `OverflowMenu` component is either defaulting to a `light` prop value internally or is somehow detecting the `light` prop as being set even when it is not explicitly provided in the component's props. This could be due to a default value being set in the component's definition, or a prop validation or warning mechanism that is incorrectly identifying the `light` prop as being used.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

The `OverflowMenu` class is the primary component that needs to be inspected. The warning is likely being generated within this class, either due to a default value for the `light` prop or a prop validation mechanism.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/next/OverflowMenu.stories.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js
class: OverflowMenu
```

The `OverflowMenu` class in `OverflowMenu.js` is the primary location that needs inspection and editing to fix the problem. Specifically, the default value and prop validation for the `light` prop should be examined to ensure that the warning is not triggered when the `light` prop is not explicitly set.
