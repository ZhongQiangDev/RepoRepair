### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in Firefox, the ordered lists are starting at a random number instead of starting from 1. This issue arises due to the custom counter (`counter-reset: item`) used by Carbon styles, which interferes with the native ordered list styles.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the custom counter (`counter-reset: item`) applied by Carbon styles. This custom counter is used to generate the numbers for the ordered list items using a `::before` pseudo-element. However, this approach conflicts with the native ordered list styles, causing the list to start at a random number in Firefox. Overriding the style does not work, but removing the `counter-reset: item` style resolves the issue.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/OrderedList-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/OrderedList.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/OrderedList.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in this file renders the `OrderedList` component, which is directly related to the issue. The component applies the `counter-reset: item` style, which needs to be inspected and potentially modified.

### Summary of Locations That Need Inspection or Editing

```
packages/react/src/components/OrderedList/OrderedList.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `OrderedList.js` is the primary location that needs inspection and editing to fix the problem. The custom counter style applied by this function is causing the ordered lists to start at a random number in Firefox. The function should be modified to allow for the use of native ordered list decimals without the custom counter and `::before` element.
