### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the button in its danger state does not communicate the danger state to screen reader users. This means that while the button visually indicates a danger state (e.g., with red color or specific styling), this information is not conveyed to users relying on screen readers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the lack of proper ARIA attributes or other accessibility mechanisms that would inform screen readers about the danger state of the button. Specifically, the button should include an `aria-describedby` attribute that references a visually hidden span containing a description of the danger state, or it should have an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute that includes this information.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
function: Button
```

The `Button` function is the core component responsible for rendering buttons. It accepts various props, including `kind`, which determines the button's style (e.g., `danger`). To fix the issue, the `Button` function should include logic to add appropriate ARIA attributes when the `kind` is set to `danger`.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/TooltipIcon/TooltipIcon.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js

This is the only relevant location where the issue can be addressed by adding the necessary ARIA attributes to communicate the danger state to screen reader users.
