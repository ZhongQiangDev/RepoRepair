### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description mentions the need for a "combo button" that combines a button with a contextual menu. The wrong behavior here is that the current implementation does not provide a combo button that integrates a button with a contextual menu. Instead, it seems to describe a contextual menu and a button as separate components.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely due to the lack of a specific component that combines the functionality of a button with a contextual menu. The current components (`Button`, `ComboBox`, `Menu`, and `MenuItem`) do not inherently provide this combo button functionality. The `Button` component is a standalone button, the `ComboBox` is a dropdown input field, and the `Menu` and `MenuItem` components are for creating menus but do not integrate with a button.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js ---
This file contains the `Button` component, which is a standalone button. It does not integrate with a contextual menu. Therefore, this file contains no relevant functions/classes for the combo button functionality.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js ---
This file contains the `ComboBox` component, which is a dropdown input field and not a combo button. It does not integrate with a button or a contextual menu. Therefore, this file contains no relevant functions/classes for the combo button functionality.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js ---
This file contains the `Menu` component, which is a contextual menu. It could be relevant if integrated with a button to create a combo button. However, it currently does not integrate with a button.

```
packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js
function: Menu
```

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Menu/MenuItem.js ---
This file contains the `MenuItem` component, which is a part of the `Menu` component. It is not directly relevant to creating a combo button but could be used within the combo button if integrated with a button and a menu.

```
packages/react/src/components/Menu/MenuItem.js
function: MenuItem
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/react/src/components/Menu/Menu.js
function: Menu

packages/react/src/components/Menu/MenuItem.js
function: MenuItem
```

These locations are relevant because they contain the `Menu` and `MenuItem` components, which could be integrated with a button to create the desired combo button functionality. However, additional development is required to combine these components into a single combo button.
