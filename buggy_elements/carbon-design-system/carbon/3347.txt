### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `danger` property is set to `true` on the `ComposedModal` component, the left button's `kind` property is set to `tertiary` (gray), instead of `secondary` (black), as expected. This is inconsistent with the behavior of the `Modal` component, where the left button remains `secondary` (black) when `danger` is `true`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises from the conditional statement in the `ComposedModal` component's source code:

kind={danger ? 'tertiary' : 'secondary'}

This statement sets the `kind` property of the left button to `tertiary` when `danger` is `true`, which results in the button being gray instead of black. The expected behavior should be to set the `kind` property to `secondary` when `danger` is `true`, matching the behavior of the `Modal` component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal-story.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ComposedModal.js
class: ModalFooter
class: ComposedModal
```

The `ModalFooter` class is relevant because it provides a customizable footer section for a modal dialog, typically containing action buttons like primary and secondary actions, along with optional custom content. The `ComposedModal` class is also relevant because it manages the modal dialog behavior, including the conditional logic for setting the `kind` property of the buttons.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ModalFooter.js`

```
packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ModalFooter.js
class: ModalFooter
```

The `ModalFooter` class is relevant because it renders the footer section of the modal, including the buttons. The conditional logic for setting the `kind` property of the buttons is likely implemented here.

#### `packages/react/src/components/ComposedModal/ModalHeader.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
