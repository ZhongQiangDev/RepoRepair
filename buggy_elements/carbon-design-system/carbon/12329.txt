### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `DatePicker` component in version 11 does not accept a `ref` prop, which was possible in version 10. This causes issues for users who rely on the `ref` to interact with the date picker, such as accessing its input element.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely that the `DatePicker` component in version 11 is not using `React.forwardRef` to forward the `ref` prop to the underlying DOM element. In React, function components cannot directly receive `ref` props unless they are wrapped with `React.forwardRef`. Without `forwardRef`, any attempt to pass a `ref` to the `DatePicker` will result in a warning and the `ref` will not be accessible.
