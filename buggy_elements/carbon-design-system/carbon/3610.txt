### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `light` prop is not being passed down to the underlying `<Listbox>` component when it is provided to the React listbox components. As a result, the `bx--list-box--light` class is not being applied when the `light` knob is set to `true`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the `light` prop is being handled in the components that use the `<Listbox>`. Specifically, the `light` prop needs to be explicitly passed down to the `<Listbox>` component so that it can apply the appropriate class (`bx--list-box--light`) when the prop is `true`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
class: ComboBox
```
The `ComboBox` class accepts a `light` prop, but it is not clear from the description whether this prop is being passed down to the underlying `<Listbox>` component. Therefore, this class is relevant and should be inspected to ensure the `light` prop is correctly passed down.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
class: Dropdown
```
The `Dropdown` class also accepts a `light` prop. Similar to the `ComboBox` class, it is necessary to inspect this class to ensure the `light` prop is being passed down to the underlying `<Listbox>` component.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` in this file is responsible for rendering the `ListBox` component. It accepts a `light` prop and uses it to conditionally apply the `bx--list-box--light` class. This function is relevant and should be inspected to ensure it is correctly handling the `light` prop.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `ListBoxMenu` component does not appear to directly handle the `light` prop, so it is not relevant to the issue.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `ListBoxMenuItem` component does not appear to directly handle the `light` prop, so it is not relevant to the issue.
