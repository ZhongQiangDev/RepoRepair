### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when destructuring the `DataTable` components from `@carbon/react`, the application breaks with console errors. Specifically, the error messages indicate that the component types are invalid, suggesting that the destructured components are not being recognized correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the `DataTable` components are being exported and imported. When destructuring from `DataTable`, the components may not be properly exported as named exports, leading to them being `undefined` when imported. This results in the application breaking because React expects valid component types but receives `undefined`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
class: DataTable
```
This file contains the `DataTable` class, which is the main component being imported and destructured. The issue may be related to how the `DataTable` class exports its nested components.

#### --- packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file defines the `TableContainer` component, but it is not directly related to the export/import issue described.

#### --- packages/react/tasks/build.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to the build process and does not directly impact the component exports or imports.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
   class: DataTable
   ```
   This file needs inspection to ensure that the `DataTable` class correctly exports its nested components as named exports.

2. ```
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js
   ```
   This file does not need inspection as it is not directly related to the export/import issue.

3. ```
   packages/react/tasks/build.js
   ```
   This file does not need inspection as it is not directly related to the export/import issue.

### Conclusion

The primary location that needs inspection is the `DataTable.js` file, specifically the `DataTable` class, to ensure that the nested components are correctly exported as named exports. The other files provided do not appear to be directly related to the issue.
