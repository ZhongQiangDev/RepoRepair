### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `title` attribute is being added to `Menu.Item` components by default. This causes issues such as:
- Violation of WCAG guidelines when `title` and `innerText` are the same.
- Unwanted hover tooltips for some users who prefer not to have them.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the automatic addition of the `title` attribute to `Menu.Item` components. This could be happening in the rendering logic of the `Menu.Item` component or in a higher-level function that processes menu items.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/menu/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/menu/view/item.jsx ---
```
src/menu/view/item.jsx
class: Item
```
The `Item` class is responsible for rendering menu items. The `getTitle` method might be where the `title` attribute is being set. This class should be inspected to see if it automatically adds the `title` attribute and how it can be controlled.

#### --- src/menu/view/menu.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/menu/view/selectable-item.jsx ---
```
src/menu/view/selectable-item.jsx
class: SelectableItem
```
The `SelectableItem` class is another component that renders selectable menu items. It might also be involved in setting the `title` attribute. This class should be inspected to see if it automatically adds the `title` attribute and how it can be controlled.

#### --- src/menu-button/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
