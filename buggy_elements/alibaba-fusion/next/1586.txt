### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a node in the tree component is selected, the `selected` property in the `extra` parameter changes to `false` after the first click and does not toggle back to `true` on subsequent clicks. Additionally, the CSS styles do not change accordingly, making it impossible to visually distinguish between selected and unselected states.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the `selected` state is being managed and updated within the tree component. Specifically, the `onSelect` event handler might not be correctly toggling the `selected` state, or there could be an issue with how the `selectedKeys` are being managed and passed down to the tree nodes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
docs/tree/theme/index.jsx
class: FunctionDemo
class: FunctionDemoLine
```
2. ```
src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx
class: TreeNode
```
3. ```
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
class: Tree
```

These classes are likely involved in managing the tree structure, node states, and rendering, which are directly related to the issue described. The `FunctionDemo` and `FunctionDemoLine` classes handle the demo functionality and state management, while the `TreeNode` and `Tree` classes manage the actual tree nodes and their states.
