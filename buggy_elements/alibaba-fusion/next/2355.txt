### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described in the GitHub problem is that the `dataIndex` property in the `Table.Column` component does not support string values in the format `'[start, end]'`. This causes a `TypeError` when trying to access properties using this format, as shown in the provided images and code snippets.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `fetchDataByPath` function in `src/table/util.js` does not handle the `dataIndex` format `'[start, end]'` correctly. Specifically, the regular expression used to match array indices (`/(.*)\[(.*)\]/`) does not correctly parse the string `'[start, end]'`, leading to an incorrect key extraction and ultimately a `TypeError`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/table/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/table/base.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/table/column.jsx ---
```
src/table/column.jsx
class: Column
```

The `Column` class defines the `dataIndex` prop, which is used to specify the field corresponding to the column. This class is relevant because it uses the `dataIndex` prop, which is the source of the issue.

#### --- src/table/util.js ---
```
src/table/util.js
function: function_3
```

The `function_3` (named `fetchDataByPath`) is responsible for fetching nested values from an object based on the `dataIndex` path. This function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `'[start, end]'` format.

#### --- src/table/expanded/row.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
