### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that the overlay content collapses when it is inline, and there is no space for the browser to render it properly. The suggested solution is to add `width: 100%` to the overlay content to solve the issue.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to be related to the CSS styling of the overlay content. When the content is inline, it may not have a defined width, causing it to collapse. Adding `width: 100%` ensures that the content takes up the full available width, preventing it from collapsing.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `docs/collapse/theme/index.jsx`
This file contains functions related to rendering internationalized content and does not seem directly related to the overlay component or its styling. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/overlay/manager.js`
This file contains functions for managing overlays, such as adding, removing, and checking the current overlay. These functions do not directly relate to the styling of the overlay content:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/overlay/overlay.jsx`
This file contains functions and a class related to the overlay component. The `Overlay` class is responsible for rendering and managing the overlay, which is directly related to the issue described. The functions `function_1`, `function_2`, and `function_3` are helper functions that might be indirectly related to the styling of the overlay content.

```
src/overlay/overlay.jsx
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
class: Overlay
```

#### `src/overlay/position.jsx`
This file contains the `Position` class, which manages the dynamic positioning of a child element relative to a target element or the viewport. While positioning is important, it does not directly address the issue of the overlay content collapsing due to inline styling:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `types/overlay/index.d.ts`
This file contains type definitions for the `Overlay` and `Popup` classes and their respective props. These definitions do not directly relate to the styling issue:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations
