### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using the `NumberPicker` component with a `defaultValue` of `4.02`, a `step` of `0.01`, and a `precision` of `2`, clicking the `+` button results in the value being displayed as `4.029999999999999` instead of the expected `4.03`. This is due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the way JavaScript handles floating-point arithmetic. When adding `4.02` and `0.01`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the limitations of binary floating-point representation. This results in a value like `4.029999999999999`, which is then displayed by the `NumberPicker`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/number-picker/index.jsx`

This file contains the `NumberPicker` class, which is directly related to the issue described. The class handles the value, step, and precision of the number picker. The methods that need inspection or editing include those that handle value updates and precision rounding.

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

#### `src/util/dom.js`

This file contains various DOM utility functions. None of these functions are directly related to the floating-point arithmetic issue described in the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/util/events.js`

This file contains event utility functions. None of these functions are directly related to the floating-point arithmetic issue described in the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/util/object.js`

This file contains object utility functions. None of these functions are directly related to the floating-point arithmetic issue described in the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/util/string.js`

This file contains string utility functions. None of these functions are directly related to the floating-point arithmetic issue described in the problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The only file that contains relevant functions or classes is `src/number-picker/index.jsx`, specifically the `NumberPicker` class. The methods within this class that handle value updates and precision rounding need to be inspected and potentially edited to address the floating-point arithmetic issue.
