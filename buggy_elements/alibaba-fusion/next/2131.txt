### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves an error where the `pos` property cannot be added to an object because the object is not extensible. This is indicated by the error message "Cannot add property pos, object is not extensible." Additionally, the error "Cannot read property 'pos' of undefined" suggests that at some point, the code attempts to access the `pos` property on an undefined object.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the `item.pos` assignment within the `drill` function in `tree.js`. The error suggests that the `item` object is either not extensible or is undefined when the code tries to assign or access the `pos` property. This could happen if the `item` object is frozen or if it is not properly initialized before the assignment.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `src/tree/view/tree.js`
```
src/tree/view/tree.js
function: drill
```

The `drill` function is where the error occurs. The function iterates over `data` and assigns a `pos` property to each `item`. The error suggests that either the `item` object is not extensible or it is undefined at some point during the iteration.

### Relevant Code Snippet from `tree.js`
```javascript
var drill = function drill() {
  var data = arguments.length > 0 && arguments[0] !== undefined ? arguments[0] : [];
  var level = arguments.length > 1 && arguments[1] !== undefined ? arguments[1] : 1;
  var prefix = arguments.length > 2 && arguments[2] !== undefined ? arguments[2] : '0';
  var parent = arguments.length > 3 ? arguments[3] : undefined;

  return data.map(function (item, index) {
    // ... other code ...
    var pos = prefix + '-' + index;
    var key = item.key;
    console.log("pos");
    console.log(pos);
    console.log(item.pos); // This line logs undefined
    item.pos = pos; // This line causes the error
    item.level = level;
    // ... other code ...
  });
};
```

### Conclusion

The `drill` function in `tree.js` is relevant to the issue. The error occurs because the `item` object is either not extensible or is undefined when the `pos` property is being assigned. This needs to be investigated further to ensure that `item` is properly initialized and is extensible before the assignment.
