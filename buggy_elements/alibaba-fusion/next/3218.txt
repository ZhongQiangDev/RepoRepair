### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that some Select demo styles are too absolute, affecting the appearance of other demos. Specifically, the images show that the `margin-bottom` and `margin-right` styles are hardcoded in the CSS for the `.next-select` class, which is causing inconsistent spacing between different Select components in the demo.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the CSS styles for the Select component are too specific and are not being overridden or adjusted properly for different demo scenarios. The hardcoded `margin-bottom` and `margin-right` values in the `.next-select` class are affecting the layout of the Select components in various demos, leading to inconsistent spacing and layout issues.

### Relevant Files and Locations

The relevant files and locations that need inspection or editing are:

```
docs/select/demo/combobox-basic.md
css: .next-select

docs/select/demo/select-basic.md
css: .next-select
```

These files contain the hardcoded CSS styles for the `.next-select` class that are causing the layout issues in the Select demos. The `margin-bottom` and `margin-right` values should be adjusted or removed to ensure consistent spacing across different demo scenarios.
