### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `Rating` component is given an `id` attribute and the user clicks to change the rating, the `onChange` callback is triggered twice. This results in two console logs for a single click action, which is unexpected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be related to how event listeners are being attached and managed within the `Rating` component. Specifically, the `id` attribute might be causing an unintended re-render or event listener duplication, leading to the `onChange` callback being triggered twice.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/rating/adaptor/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains adaptor functions that do not directly handle event listeners or the `onChange` callback.

#### --- src/rating/index.jsx ---
```
src/rating/index.jsx
function: function_1
```
This file contains a function that handles deprecated properties. While it does not directly handle the `onChange` event, it might be relevant if the deprecated property handling is causing re-renders or other side effects.

#### --- src/rating/rating.jsx ---
```
src/rating/rating.jsx
class: Rating
```
This file contains the `Rating` class, which is the core component responsible for rendering the rating interface and handling user interactions. The `handleClick` method within this class is likely where the `onChange` callback is triggered. This class should be inspected for any issues related to event listener management or re-rendering.

#### --- src/util/events.js ---
```
src/util/events.js
function: on
function: off
function: once
```
This file contains utility functions for managing event listeners. The `on` function is used to add event listeners, and the `off` function is used to remove them. The `once` function is used for one-time event listeners. These functions should be inspected to ensure they are not causing event listeners to be added or removed incorrectly.

#### --- types/rating/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains TypeScript type definitions and does not directly handle event listeners or the `onChange` callback.
