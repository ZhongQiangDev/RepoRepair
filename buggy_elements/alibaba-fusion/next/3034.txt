### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `Upload` component, when using `itemRender`, does not support the deletion of uploaded files. The image provided shows that the delete button (indicated by the "X" icon) is not functioning as expected, preventing users from removing uploaded files.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the `itemRender` function not properly integrating the delete functionality. The `itemRender` function is responsible for customizing the display of each uploaded file item, but it may not be correctly passing the necessary props or callbacks to enable file deletion. This could be due to missing or incorrectly implemented `onRemove` callbacks or the `closable` prop not being set correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/upload/card.jsx ---
```
src/upload/card.jsx
class: Card
```
The `Card` class manages the state of uploaded files and handles user interactions such as removing files. The `onRemove` callback is a key part of this functionality. If `itemRender` is used, it must correctly pass the `onRemove` callback to the rendered items.

#### --- src/upload/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are primarily related to deprecation warnings and property transformations, which are not directly related to the deletion functionality.

#### --- src/upload/list.jsx ---
```
src/upload/list.jsx
class: List
```
The `List` class is responsible for displaying the list of uploaded files and handling file operations like removal. The `closable` prop and `onRemove` callback are crucial for enabling file deletion. If `itemRender` is used, it must correctly integrate these props.

#### --- src/upload/upload.jsx ---
```
src/upload/upload.jsx
class: Upload
```
The `Upload` class manages the overall upload functionality, including file list management and callbacks. The `onRemove` callback is a key part of this functionality. If `itemRender` is used, it must correctly pass the `onRemove` callback to the rendered items.

#### --- src/upload/runtime/html5-uploader.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Html5Uploader` class is related to the underlying file upload mechanism and does not directly handle the UI rendering or deletion functionality.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/upload/card.jsx
class: Card
```
2. ```
src/upload/list.jsx
class: List
```
3. ```
src/upload/upload.jsx
class: Upload
```

These classes are directly involved in managing the upload and deletion of files and should be inspected to ensure that the `itemRender` function correctly integrates the necessary props and callbacks for file deletion.
