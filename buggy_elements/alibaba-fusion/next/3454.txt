### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when the `max` value is increased, the `NumberPicker` component does not immediately reflect this change. Specifically, the component does not update its maximum allowed value in real-time after the `max` value is incremented.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from the `NumberPicker` component not properly re-rendering or updating its internal state when the `max` prop changes. This could be due to a few potential issues:

- The `NumberPicker` component might not be listening for changes to the `max` prop.
- The `NumberPicker` component might not be updating its internal state or re-rendering when the `max` prop changes.
- There might be a delay or issue in the event handling that updates the `max` value.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- docs/number-picker/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/number-picker/index.jsx ---
```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: NumberPicker
```

- `function_1`: This function is a transformer for the input `props` object and does not directly handle the `max` prop or the re-rendering logic.
- `NumberPicker`: This class is the main component that handles the `max` prop and should update its internal state when the `max` prop changes. It is relevant to the issue.

#### --- src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx ---
```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

- `NumberPicker`: This class is the main component that handles the `max` prop and should update its internal state when the `max` prop changes. It is relevant to the issue.

#### --- types/number-picker/index.d.ts ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: NumberPicker

src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```

These locations should be inspected and potentially edited to ensure that the `NumberPicker` component correctly updates its internal state and re-renders when the `max` prop changes.
