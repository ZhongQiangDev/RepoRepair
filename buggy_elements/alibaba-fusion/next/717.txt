### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `Select` component does not display the `defaultValue` ("jack") when `fillProps` is used with an empty `dataSource`. The expected behavior is for the `defaultValue` to be displayed in the input field, even if the `dataSource` is empty.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises because the `Select` component relies on the `dataSource` to populate the options and fill the selected value. When the `dataSource` is empty, the component may not have the necessary data to display the `defaultValue` correctly, even though `fillProps` is specified. The component might be checking the `dataSource` for the `defaultValue` and failing to find it, resulting in no value being displayed.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- docs/select/theme/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/select/data-store.js ---
```
src/select/data-store.js
class: DataStore
```
The `DataStore` class is responsible for handling the data manipulation for the `Select` component. It manages the `dataSource`, `menuDataSource`, and other derived data structures. If the `dataSource` is empty, the `DataStore` might not be able to find the `defaultValue` and thus not display it.

#### --- src/select/index.jsx ---
```
src/select/index.jsx
function: function_2
```
The `function_2` function is a prop transformer for the `Select` component. While it primarily handles deprecation warnings and prop migration, it might be relevant if it affects how `defaultValue` or `fillProps` are processed.

#### --- src/select/select.jsx ---
```
src/select/select.jsx
class: Select
```
The `Select` class is the main component responsible for rendering the dropdown selection interface. It handles the `defaultValue`, `dataSource`, and `fillProps` props. The issue likely lies within this class, as it manages the display of the selected value based on the provided props.

#### --- types/select/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
