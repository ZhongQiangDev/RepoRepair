### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that setting `timePanelProps.defaultValue` results in the display of "Invalid Date" in the time panel of the `DatePicker2` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `defaultValue` is being handled within the `TimePanel` component. The `defaultValue` might not be correctly parsed or formatted, leading to an invalid date being displayed. This could be due to incorrect initialization, parsing, or validation of the `defaultValue`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/date-picker2/prop-types.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/date-picker2/util.js`

#### `src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx`

```
src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx
class: TimePanel
```

The `TimePanel` class is directly responsible for handling the time selection and display. The issue likely lies within how the `defaultValue` is processed and displayed. Specifically, the `formater` method and the `defaultValue` prop handling should be examined.

#### `src/time-picker2/utils/index.js`

```
src/time-picker2/utils/index.js
function: formatDateValue
```

The `formatDateValue` function is responsible for parsing and validating date values. If the `defaultValue` is not correctly formatted or parsed, this function might return `null`, leading to an "Invalid Date" display.
