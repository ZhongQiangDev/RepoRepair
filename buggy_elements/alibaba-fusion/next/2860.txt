### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the keyboard focus moves to the internal operation buttons of the `NumberPicker` component, the operation buttons remain hidden, and the focus state of the `NumberPicker` disappears. The expected behavior is that the operation buttons should be visible, and the focus state should be maintained using `:focus-within`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the following causes:
- The CSS styles for the operation buttons may not be correctly applied when they receive focus.
- The `NumberPicker` component may not be using the `:focus-within` pseudo-class to maintain the focus state when the internal elements are focused.
- The event handling for focus and blur events may not be correctly managing the visibility of the operation buttons.

The `UIState` class manages the focus state of UI elements. It may need to be updated to ensure that the focus state is maintained correctly when the internal elements of the `NumberPicker` are focused.

#### --- src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx ---
```
src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx
class: NumberPicker
```
The `NumberPicker` class is the main component that needs to be inspected. It handles the rendering of the input and operation buttons, and it should ensure that the buttons are visible when they receive focus and that the focus state is maintained.
