### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that the `popupContainer` configuration set in `ConfigProvider` does not affect the `Dialog` component. This results in the `Dialog` being rendered in an incorrect location, as shown in the image where the `Dialog` overlaps with other elements.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the `popupContainer` configuration is not being properly propagated or utilized by the `Dialog` component. The `popupContainer` is intended to specify the DOM node where the popup (in this case, the `Dialog`) should be mounted. If this configuration is not respected, the `Dialog` will default to being mounted in `document.body`, which can lead to layout issues like the one shown.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/config-provider/error-boundary.jsx`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `ErrorBoundary` class and `DefaultUI` function are not directly related to the `popupContainer` configuration or the `Dialog` component.

#### `src/dialog/dialog.jsx`
```
src/dialog/dialog.jsx
class: Dialog
```
The `Dialog` class is directly relevant because it is the component that is not respecting the `popupContainer` configuration. The issue likely lies within how the `Dialog` is rendered or positioned.

#### `src/overlay/popup.jsx`
```
src/overlay/popup.jsx
class: Popup
```
The `Popup` class is relevant because it handles the mounting and positioning of overlay components like the `Dialog`. The `container` prop of the `Popup` class is where the `popupContainer` configuration should be applied.

#### `types/config-provider/index.d.ts`
```
types/config-provider/index.d.ts
class: ConfigProvider
```
The `ConfigProvider` class is relevant because it is responsible for providing the `popupContainer` configuration to other components. The issue might be in how the `ConfigProvider` is passing down the configuration or how components are consuming it.

#### `types/dialog/index.d.ts`
```
types/dialog/index.d.ts
class: Dialog
```
The `Dialog` class definition in the types file is relevant because it defines the interface for the `Dialog` component. If the `popupContainer` configuration is not properly typed or documented here, it could lead to issues in implementation.
