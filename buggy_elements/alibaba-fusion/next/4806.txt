### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after a user selects all the results in the `CascaderSelect` component while using the search functionality, the search results do not clear automatically. This leaves the user on the search results page, and they must manually click outside the dropdown to return to the full list view.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the lack of a mechanism to automatically clear the search results when all items have been selected. The component does not detect when all items are selected and does not reset the search state accordingly. Additionally, there is no user interface element (like a button) to manually clear the search results.
