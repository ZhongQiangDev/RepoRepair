### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user types a character (e.g., 'r') and triggers an autocomplete suggestion (e.g., 'Recent'), pressing the Enter key results in the search being performed with the typed character ('r') instead of the selected suggestion ('Recent').

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `onSearch` event is handled. When the Enter key is pressed, the `onSearch` function is triggered, but it may be using the current input value ('r') instead of the selected suggestion ('Recent'). This could be due to the event handling not properly updating the input value to the selected suggestion before triggering the search.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/search/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- docs/search/theme/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/search/Search.jsx ---
```
src/search/Search.jsx
class: Search
```
The `Search` class is likely where the event handling for the search input and suggestions is defined. The `onSearch` function and how it interacts with the `dataSource` and `value` props should be examined.

#### --- src/select/auto-complete.jsx ---
```
src/select/auto-complete.jsx
class: AutoComplete
```
The `AutoComplete` class handles the autocomplete functionality, including the selection of suggestions. The `handleMenuSelect`, `handleItemClick`, and `chooseHighlightItem` methods may need to be reviewed to ensure they correctly update the input value when a suggestion is selected.

#### --- types/search/index.d.ts ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
