### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem description states that the `Field` component should not modify the input data. However, the code snippet shows that the `Field` class directly assigns `options.values` to `this.values` without creating a copy. This means that any changes made to `this.values` within the `Field` class will also modify the original `options.values` object, which is not the desired behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `Field` class is directly referencing the `options.values` object instead of creating a copy of it. As a result, any modifications made to `this.values` will also affect the original `options.values` object. To fix this, the `Field` class should create a deep copy of `options.values` before assigning it to `this.values`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `es/field/index.js`
This file contains the `Field` class, which is directly related to the issue. The `Field` class is responsible for managing form fields and their values. The problematic line is in the constructor where `this.values` is assigned the `options.values` object directly.

```
es/field/index.js
class: Field
```

#### `es/field/utils.js`
This file contains utility functions that are used by the `Field` class. None of these functions directly modify the input data, so they are not directly related to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/field/index.js`
This file contains the `function_2` which is a constructor function similar to the `Field` class in `es/field/index.js`. It also directly assigns `options.values` to `this.values` without creating a copy.

```
lib/field/index.js
function: function_2
```

#### `lib/validate/rules/required.js`
This file contains the `required` validation rule function. It does not modify the input data, so it is not related to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/field/index.js`
This file contains the `Field` class, which is the same as the one in `es/field/index.js`. It also directly assigns `options.values` to `this.values` without creating a copy.

```
src/field/index.js
class: Field
```
