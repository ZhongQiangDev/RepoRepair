### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described in the GitHub problem is that when business logic encapsulates styles and adds additional DOM structures, the `useLabelForErrorMessage` API does not work as expected. The user wants an additional `errorMessageLabel` API to work in conjunction with `useLabelForErrorMessage` to ensure that the label text is used as the error message prompt.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely due to the way the `useLabelForErrorMessage` API is implemented. When additional DOM structures are added, the API may not correctly identify the label text to use for error messages. The user wants a new API (`errorMessageLabel`) that can explicitly specify the label text to be used for error messages, ensuring that the label text is correctly displayed even when the DOM structure is modified.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/core/theme/form-element.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/form/error.jsx ---
```
src/form/error.jsx
class: Error
```

The `Error` class is responsible for displaying validation errors for form fields. It may need to be updated to support the new `errorMessageLabel` API.

#### --- src/form/item.jsx ---
```
src/form/item.jsx
class: Item
```

The `Item` class wraps form elements and handles validation and labeling. It may need to be updated to support the new `errorMessageLabel` API and ensure it works correctly with `useLabelForErrorMessage`.

#### --- src/util/pick-attrs.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- types/form/index.d.ts ---
```
types/form/index.d.ts
function: FormProps
function: ItemProps
```

The `FormProps` and `ItemProps` interfaces define the properties for the `Form` and `Item` components. These interfaces may need to be updated to include the new `errorMessageLabel` property.
