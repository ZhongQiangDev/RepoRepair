### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when the content of the tabs exceeds the available space, the tabs do not support dragging or keyboard scrolling. This makes it inconvenient for users to navigate through the tabs when they overflow.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the handling of tab overflow and the lack of support for dragging or keyboard navigation when the tabs exceed the available space. Specifically, the `excessMode` property is set to `'slide'`, but the implementation does not provide the expected dragging or keyboard scrolling functionality.
