### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that the left arrow (previous arrow) is disabled when `slidesToShow > slidesCount` and `infinite={false}` and `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`. This means that the left arrow should be enabled to allow navigation to the previous slide, but it is currently disabled.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the logic that determines whether the navigation arrows should be enabled or disabled. Specifically, the conditions under which the left arrow is disabled may not be correctly handling the scenario where `slidesToShow > slidesCount`, `infinite={false}`, and `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx`
```
src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx
class: Arrow
```
The `Arrow` class is responsible for rendering the navigation arrows and determining whether they should be disabled. The `isDisabled` static method likely contains the logic that needs to be inspected and potentially modified.
