### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the user wants an API to remove the title information from the Cascader component. The image shows a dropdown menu with a title ("请选择" - "Please Select") that the user wants to remove.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The title "请选择" is likely part of the default rendering behavior of the Cascader component. To remove this title, we need to identify where this title is being added in the component's rendering logic and provide an API to control its display.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/cascader/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains functions related to data processing and configuration for the Cascader component. None of these functions directly handle the rendering of the title.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- docs/cascader/theme/index.jsx ---
This file contains functions related to creating data sources and rendering demos. These functions do not directly handle the rendering of the title.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/cascader/cascader.jsx ---
This file contains the `Cascader` class, which is the main component responsible for rendering the cascading menu. The title "请选择" is likely rendered within this class.

```
src/cascader/cascader.jsx
class: Cascader
```

#### --- src/cascader/item.jsx ---
This file contains the `CascaderMenuItem` class, which renders individual items within the cascading menu. The title is not likely rendered here.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/cascader/menu.jsx ---
This file contains the `CascaderMenu` class, which renders the menu wrapper. The title is not likely rendered here.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant location to inspect or edit to fix the problem is:

```
src/cascader/cascader.jsx
class: Cascader
```

This class should be examined to find where the title "请选择" is being rendered and to add an API to control its display.
