### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when using virtual scrolling in the `CascaderSelect` component, the background color appears abnormal. The screenshot shows a cascading menu with multiple levels, and the background color of the menu items seems to be inconsistent or incorrect.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from how the virtual scrolling is implemented in the `CascaderSelect` component. Virtual scrolling optimizes performance by rendering only the items that are visible in the viewport, but it can sometimes cause issues with styling and layout if not handled correctly. The background color issue could be due to:

- Incorrect styling being applied to the virtual list items.
- Issues with the virtual list's rendering logic, causing some items to not receive the correct styles.
- Problems with the CSS class names or styles being applied to the menu items when virtual scrolling is enabled.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/cascader/cascader.tsx ---
```
components/cascader/cascader.tsx
function: setCascaderInnerWidth
function: componentDidMount
function: componentDidUpdate
```
- `setCascaderInnerWidth`: This function sets the width of the cascader inner element, which might affect the layout and styling of the menu items.
- `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`: These lifecycle methods might be involved in setting up or updating the virtual scrolling behavior, which could impact the background color issue.

#### --- components/cascader/menu.tsx ---
```
components/cascader/menu.tsx
class: CascaderMenu
```
- The `CascaderMenu` class handles the rendering of the menu items and the virtual scrolling logic. The `scrollToSelectedItem` method and the `render` method could be relevant to the background color issue.

#### --- components/cascader-select/types.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- This file defines types and interfaces but does not contain any implementation that could directly cause the background color issue.

#### --- components/dropdown/dropdown.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- The `Dropdown` class is not directly related to the `CascaderSelect` component or its virtual scrolling behavior.

#### --- components/virtual-list/index.d.ts ---
```
components/virtual-list/index.d.ts
class: VirtualList
```
- The `VirtualList` class is responsible for the virtual scrolling functionality. Issues with the virtual list's rendering logic or styling could be causing the background color problem.
