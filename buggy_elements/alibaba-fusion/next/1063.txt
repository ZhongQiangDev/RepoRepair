### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem description states that the `Field` component should not modify the input data. However, the code snippet provided shows that the `Field` class directly assigns the `options.values` to `this.values` without creating a copy. This means that any changes made to `this.values` within the `Field` class will also modify the original `options.values`, which is not the desired behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the `Field` class is directly assigning the `options.values` object to `this.values` without creating a deep copy. As a result, any modifications to `this.values` will also affect the original `options.values` object. To fix this, `this.values` should be initialized with a deep copy of `options.values` to ensure that the original data remains unchanged.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/field/index.js
```
src/field/index.js
class: Field
```
The `Field` class is directly relevant because it is where the issue occurs. The `Field` class needs to be modified to ensure that `this.values` is initialized with a deep copy of `options.values`.

#### src/field/utils.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file do not directly relate to the initialization of `this.values` in the `Field` class.

#### src/form/enhance.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to form field initialization and configuration but do not directly impact the issue described.

#### src/form/form.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Form` class and related functions do not directly impact the initialization of `this.values` in the `Field` class.

#### src/form/item.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `Item` class and related functions do not directly impact the initialization of `this.values` in the `Field` class.
