### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the Transfer component currently does not support controlling the search functionality separately for the left and right panels. The user wants to enable the search box only for the left panel and disable it for the right panel.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the `showSearch` prop in the Transfer component is a single boolean value that controls the search functionality for both panels simultaneously. There is no mechanism to specify different search settings for each panel independently.

```
The `TransferPanel` class is responsible for rendering each panel (left and right). It has a `showSearch` prop that controls whether the search functionality is enabled. To support separate search controls for each panel, this class needs to be modified to accept a more granular configuration for search settings.

#### --- src/transfer/view/transfer.jsx ---
```
src/transfer/view/transfer.jsx
class: Transfer
```
The `Transfer` class is the main component that manages the transfer interface. It currently uses a single `showSearch` prop to control the search functionality for both panels. This class needs to be updated to allow separate search settings for each panel.

#### --- types/transfer/index.d.ts ---
```
types/transfer/index.d.ts
function: TransferProps
```
The `TransferProps` interface defines the props accepted by the `Transfer` component. It currently includes a single `showSearch` boolean. This interface needs to be updated to include separate search settings for the left and right panels.
