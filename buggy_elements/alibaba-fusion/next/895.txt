### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that in `iconOnly` mode, navigation items without configured icons are displaying blank spaces instead of being hidden or rendered without the blank space. This is evident from the screenshot where some items appear with a blank space where an icon should be.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises because the `iconOnly` mode is not properly handling cases where an icon is not provided for a navigation item. Instead of hiding the item or rendering it without the blank space, it is rendering a placeholder or empty space, which is not the desired behavior.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- docs/nav/theme/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/nav/group.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/nav/item.jsx ---
```
src/nav/item.jsx
class: Item
```
The `Item` class is responsible for rendering individual navigation items. It handles the `icon` prop and the `iconOnly` context. If an icon is not provided and `iconOnly` is true, it should handle this case to avoid rendering blank spaces.

#### --- src/nav/nav.jsx ---
```
src/nav/nav.jsx
class: Nav
```
The `Nav` class manages the overall navigation component and passes down the `iconOnly` context to child components. It may need to ensure that child components handle the `iconOnly` mode correctly.

#### --- src/nav/sub-nav.jsx ---
```
src/nav/sub-nav.jsx
class: SubNav
```
The `SubNav` class handles sub-navigation items and may also need to handle the `iconOnly` mode correctly, especially if it contains items without icons.
