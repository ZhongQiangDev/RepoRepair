### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that when there is no title in the dialog, the close button's position is incorrect, as it overlaps with the text content of the dialog. This is visually confirmed by the provided image where the close button is positioned over the text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the way the dialog's layout is structured when the title is not present. When the title is missing, the space that would normally be occupied by the title is not properly accounted for, causing the close button to shift into the area where the content is displayed. This could be due to CSS styling issues or improper layout adjustments in the rendering logic of the dialog component.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/dialog/adaptor/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- docs/dialog/theme/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/dialog/dialog.jsx ---
```
src/dialog/dialog.jsx
class: Dialog
```
The `Dialog` class is responsible for rendering the dialog component. The issue might be related to how the dialog adjusts its layout when the `title` prop is not provided. The `render` method of this class would need to be inspected to see how it handles the absence of a title and positions the close button.

#### --- src/dialog/inner.jsx ---
```
src/dialog/inner.jsx
class: Inner
```
The `Inner` class is responsible for rendering the inner parts of the dialog, including the header, body, and footer. The `renderHeader` method might be relevant here, as it generates the title section. If the title is not provided, the method might not be properly adjusting the layout for the absence of the title, causing the close button to overlap with the content.
