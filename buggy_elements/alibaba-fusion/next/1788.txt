### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described in the GitHub issue is related to a TypeScript type error involving the `onBlur` event handler for the `Input.TextArea` component. The error message indicates that the type of the `onBlur` property is incompatible. Specifically, the type `(event: MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>) => void` is not assignable to the type `() => void`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the `onBlur` event handler in the `Input.TextArea` component is expected to accept an event parameter of type `MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>`, but the type definition for `onBlur` in the TypeScript interface only allows a function with no parameters (`() => void`). This mismatch in the expected parameter types leads to the TypeScript type error.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/form/form.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/input/input.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/input/textarea.jsx ---
```
src/input/textarea.jsx
class: TextArea
```

The `TextArea` class is relevant because it is the component where the `onBlur` event handler is likely defined and used.

#### --- src/util/events.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- types/input/index.d.ts ---
```
types/input/index.d.ts
function: InputProps
function: TextAreaProps
```

The `InputProps` and `TextAreaProps` interfaces are relevant because they define the types for the `onBlur` event handler. The issue lies in the type definition for `onBlur` in these interfaces.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/input/textarea.jsx
class: TextArea

types/input/index.d.ts
function: InputProps
function: TextAreaProps
```
