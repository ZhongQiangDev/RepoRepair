### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `popupProps` prop with `v2: true` is used in the `CascaderSelect` component, it results in an error: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getInstance')`. This indicates that there is an issue with the `v2` version of the popup component, likely related to the `Popup` or `Overlay` components.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error message suggests that the `getInstance` method is being called on a `null` object, which implies that the reference to the popup or overlay instance is not being set correctly when `v2` is enabled. This could be due to a few reasons:
- The `saveRef` method is not being called or is not working as expected in the `v2` version.
- The `v2` version of the popup or overlay component is not properly initializing or rendering the necessary elements.
- There might be a mismatch in the props or state management between the `CascaderSelect` and the `Popup` or `Overlay` components when `v2` is enabled.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `docs/cascader-select/adaptor/index.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `docs/cascader-select/theme/index.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx`
```
src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx
class: CascaderSelect
```

#### `src/overlay/index.jsx`
```
src/overlay/index.jsx
class: Overlay
class: Popup
```

#### `src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx`
```
src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx
function: function_1
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx
class: CascaderSelect
```
2. ```
src/overlay/index.jsx
class: Overlay
```
3. ```
src/overlay/index.jsx
class: Popup
```
4. ```
src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx
function: function_1
```

These locations are relevant because they involve the `CascaderSelect` component and the `Popup` and `Overlay` components, which are likely involved in the rendering and management of the popup when `v2` is enabled. The `function_1` in `popup-v2.jsx` is also relevant as it defines the behavior of the `Popup` component in the `v2` version.
