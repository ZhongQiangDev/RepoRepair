### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `NumberPicker` component allows users to input values beyond the maximum limit (`max`), even though it is expected to restrict such input. When the user inputs a value greater than the maximum allowed value, the component does not prevent the input, and the value is only corrected when the input loses focus (`onBlur`).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the lack of validation during the `onChange` event. The `NumberPicker` component should ideally validate the input value against the `max` limit as soon as the user types a value, rather than waiting for the `onBlur` event. This would prevent the user from entering invalid values in the first place.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The `NumberPicker` class in both `src/number-picker/index.jsx` and `src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx` are relevant to the issue. These files define the `NumberPicker` component and handle the input validation logic. Specifically, the `onChange` event handling should be modified to validate the input value against the `max` limit immediately, rather than waiting for the `onBlur` event.
