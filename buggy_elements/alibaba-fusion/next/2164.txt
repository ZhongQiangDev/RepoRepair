### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the sorting icons in the table header do not have a `cursor: pointer` style applied to them. This means that when a user hovers over the sorting icons, the cursor does not change to indicate that the icons are clickable, which can lead to a poor user experience.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of the `cursor: pointer` CSS style being applied to the sorting icons. This style is typically used to visually indicate that an element is interactive and can be clicked. The sorting icons are part of the table header, and the style needs to be applied either directly to the icons or to the parent element that contains them.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/table/theme/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/table/base/cell.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/table/base/header.jsx ---
```
src/table/base/header.jsx
class: Header
```
The `Header` class is responsible for rendering the table header, including the sorting icons. The issue might be related to how the sorting icons are rendered and styled within this class.

#### --- src/table/base/sort.jsx ---
```
src/table/base/sort.jsx
class: Sort
```
The `Sort` class is specifically responsible for rendering the sorting UI elements. This class likely contains the logic for rendering the sorting icons and could be the place where the `cursor: pointer` style needs to be applied.

#### --- src/table/fixed/header.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/table/base/header.jsx
class: Header

src/table/base/sort.jsx
class: Sort
```

These two classes are the most relevant to the issue. The `Header` class is responsible for rendering the table header, and the `Sort` class is responsible for rendering the sorting icons. The `cursor: pointer` style should be applied in one of these classes to fix the issue.
