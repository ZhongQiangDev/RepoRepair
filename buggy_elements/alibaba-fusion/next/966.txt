### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when a `Group` component in the menu has a label with a space (e.g., "Group Label 1"), it is incorrectly interpreted as multiple children, leading to an error. The error message indicates that the `Group` component is trying to access a property `className` of an undefined object, which suggests that the `children` prop is being misinterpreted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to how the `Group` component processes its `children` prop. When the `label` prop contains a space, it seems that the component is incorrectly splitting the label into multiple children, which leads to the `children` prop being an array of strings instead of a React node. This results in the `Group` component attempting to access properties on these strings, causing the `TypeError`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/menu/view/group.jsx`

This file contains the `Group` class, which is directly related to the issue. The `Group` class is responsible for rendering the group label and its children. The problem likely lies in how the `children` prop is processed within this class.

```
src/menu/view/group.jsx
class: Group
```

#### `src/nav/group.jsx`

This file also contains a `Group` class, but it is designed for a navigation context and inherits from `Menu.Group`. While it is related to the `Group` concept, the issue described is specific to the `Menu` component, so this file is less likely to be directly relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/nav/popup-item.jsx`

This file contains the `PopupItem` class, which is not directly related to the `Group` component or the issue described. The problem is specific to how the `Group` component handles its `children` prop, so this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/table/column-group.jsx`

This file contains the `ColumnGroup` class, which is unrelated to the `Group` component in the `Menu` context. The issue described is specific to the `Menu` component, so this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/table/list-header.jsx`

This file contains the `ListHeader` class, which is unrelated to the `Group` component in the `Menu` context. The issue described is specific to the `Menu` component, so this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The only relevant file is `src/menu/view/group.jsx`, which contains the `Group` class that needs to be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue. The other files do not contain relevant functions or classes related to the described problem.
