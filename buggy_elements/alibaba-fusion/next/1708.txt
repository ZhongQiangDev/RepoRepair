### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when both disabled items and default selected items are enabled, the input box displays duplicate labels. This results in a warning message indicating that two children have the same key, which violates React's requirement for unique keys.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `TreeSelect` component handles the generation and assignment of keys for its child nodes. Specifically, when a node is both disabled and selected by default, the component might be generating duplicate keys, leading to the warning. This could be due to a flaw in the logic that generates unique keys for nodes, especially when dealing with disabled and selected states simultaneously.

#### --- docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx ---
```
docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx
function: function_4
```
The `function_4` is responsible for creating a configuration object for the `TreeSelect` component. It processes the input data and generates a data source suitable for the `TreeSelect`. The issue might be related to how it handles the `keys` object, particularly when dealing with disabled and selected states.

#### --- src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx ---
```
src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx
class: TreeNode
```
The `TreeNode` class represents a node within the tree structure and manages various states such as expansion, selection, checking, etc. The issue might be related to how it handles the `disabled` and `selected` states and generates keys for nodes.

#### --- src/tree/view/tree.jsx ---
```
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
class: Tree
```
The `Tree` class is a React component that renders a hierarchical tree structure. It manages internal state for expanded, selected, and checked nodes. The issue might be related to how it handles the generation of keys for nodes, especially when dealing with disabled and selected states.

#### --- src/tree/view/util.js ---
```
src/tree/view/util.js
function: filterChildKey
function: filterParentKey
function: forEachEnableNode
function: getAllCheckedKeys
function: getCheckableParentNode
```
This file contains utility functions that are used to manage and manipulate the tree structure. The issue might be related to how these functions handle the generation of keys for nodes, especially when dealing with disabled and selected states.

#### --- src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx ---
```
class: TreeSelect
```
The `TreeSelect` class combines a select input with a hierarchical tree structure. It manages its state for visibility, value, and search functionality. The issue might be related to how it handles the generation of keys for nodes, especially when dealing with disabled and selected states.
