### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that F# type annotations are not being highlighted correctly. In the provided screenshot, the type annotations such as `int`, `double`, and `MyUnion` are not highlighted with the desired color, as seen in the "Desired Result" screenshot.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of specific rules in the Prism language definition for F#. The language definition for F# needs to include patterns that recognize and highlight type annotations. The current language definition may not have these patterns, or the patterns may not be correctly configured.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core functionality of Prism is not specific to any particular language and does not contain language-specific highlighting rules.

#### components/prism-flow.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is specific to Flow, a type system for JavaScript, and does not contain any F# language definitions.

#### components/prism-jsx.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is specific to JSX and does not contain any F# language definitions.

#### plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This plugin is for highlighting keywords in general and does not specifically address F# type annotations.

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain relevant functions or classes for fixing the F# type annotation highlighting issue. To resolve this, you would need to create or modify a language definition file for F# that includes specific patterns for recognizing and highlighting type annotations. This file would need to be similar to `prism-flow.js` but tailored for F# syntax.
