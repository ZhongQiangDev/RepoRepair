### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that PrismJS fails to highlight class names in C++ code correctly. Specifically:
- In the inheritance declaration `class MainWindow : public QMainWindow`, `QMainWindow` is not highlighted as a class name.
- In the method definition `void MainWindow::changeWindowTitle()`, `MainWindow` is not highlighted as a class name.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the C++ language grammar rules defined in PrismJS not properly recognizing and highlighting class names in these specific contexts. The grammar rules for C++ need to be adjusted to correctly identify and highlight class names in inheritance declarations and method definitions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of PrismJS, including tokenization, highlighting, DOM integration, language management, and the plugin system. While it is essential for the overall operation of PrismJS, it does not contain specific language grammar rules for C++. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-java.js ---
This file configures syntax highlighting for Java, not C++. The grammar rules defined here are specific to Java and do not affect C++ highlighting. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-php.js ---
This file extends Prism's `clike` language syntax to add PHP-specific features. Similar to the Java file, it does not contain C++ grammar rules. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Relevant File Not Provided

The relevant file that should contain the C++ grammar rules is not provided in the "Relevant Files Information." However, based on the problem description, the relevant file would likely be something like `components/prism-cpp.js`. If this file existed, it would contain the C++ language grammar rules that need to be inspected and potentially modified.

### Hypothetical Relevant File: `components/prism-cpp.js`

If `components/prism-cpp.js` existed, it would contain the C++ grammar rules. The relevant function or class to inspect would be the one that defines the C++ language grammar rules. For example:
```
components/prism-cpp.js
function: function_1
```

In this hypothetical function, you would look for the section that defines the `class-name` pattern and ensure it correctly matches and highlights class names in the contexts mentioned in the problem description.
