### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that SQL tick marks (`) are not being recognized as string delimiters, and therefore the text within these marks is not being highlighted as strings. This results in the SQL code not being properly formatted, as seen in the provided image.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the SQL language definition within the Prism library. Specifically, the grammar rules for identifying strings in SQL are not correctly configured to recognize backticks (`) as string delimiters. The provided solution suggests modifying the `string` pattern in the SQL language definition to include backticks as valid string delimiters.
