### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect syntax highlighting of C++ literals that use single quotes (`'`) as digit separators. The current highlighting incorrectly treats the single quotes as string delimiters, leading to improper tokenization and highlighting of the numbers. For example, `1'048'576` is not recognized as a single number but is instead split into multiple tokens.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the regex pattern used for identifying numbers in the Prism C++ language definition. The current regex pattern does not account for single quotes as valid characters within numbers, leading to the incorrect splitting of the number literals. The regex needs to be updated to include single quotes as valid characters within the number pattern.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The core functionality of Prism, such as tokenization and highlighting, is generic and does not specifically handle the C++ language or its specific features like digit separators.

#### plugins/normalize-whitespace/prism-normalize-whitespace.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The whitespace normalization plugin is unrelated to the syntax highlighting of C++ literals.

```

#### components/prism-cpp.js

This file likely contains the relevant function for defining the C++ language grammar, including the regex pattern for numbers. The function that needs to be inspected and potentially edited is the one that extends the 'c' language definition and defines the 'number' token.

```
components/prism-cpp.js
function: extend('c')
```

### Summary of Locations That Need Inspection or Editing
