### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Prism.js is incorrectly identifying the `type` attribute as a keyword in TypeScript code. This results in the `type` attribute being highlighted with the same color as keywords, which is not the intended behavior. The `type` attribute should be treated as a regular property name, not a keyword.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the way Prism.js is configured to recognize keywords in TypeScript. The `type` keyword is a valid TypeScript keyword, but when used as a property name in an interface or class, it should not be highlighted as a keyword. The problem arises because the `type` keyword pattern is too broad and matches the `type` attribute in this context.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core functionality of Prism.js does not directly handle language-specific keyword recognition, so it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

#### components/prism-js-extras.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file enhances JavaScript syntax highlighting but does not specifically handle TypeScript keywords or attributes.

#### components/prism-jsdoc.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file handles JSDoc comments and is not relevant to the issue of keyword recognition in TypeScript.

#### components/prism-typescript.js
```
components/prism-typescript.js
function: function_1
```
This file is responsible for extending Prism's JavaScript language definition to support TypeScript. The `function_1` function defines the `keyword` pattern, which likely includes the `type` keyword. This pattern may be too broad and needs to be refined to avoid matching property names.

#### plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This plugin is for highlighting keywords with custom CSS classes but does not affect the recognition of keywords in the first place.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The relevant location that needs inspection or editing is:
```
components/prism-typescript.js
function: function_1
```
This function defines the TypeScript language grammar, including the `keyword` pattern, which needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the `type` attribute as a property name rather than a keyword.
