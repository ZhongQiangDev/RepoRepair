### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using single quotes within double-quoted strings in the D language, the syntax highlighting incorrectly treats the single quote as the end of the string. This results in improper highlighting of the string content. Additionally, the WYSIWYG strings (enclosed in backticks) are not being highlighted correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the grammar rules defined for the D language in Prism.js. The grammar rules for string literals in the D language need to be updated to correctly handle single quotes within double-quoted strings and to recognize WYSIWYG strings enclosed in backticks.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization and highlighting. The issue is likely related to the grammar rules for the D language, which are not explicitly defined in this file. However, the `tokenize` function and the `languages` object are relevant as they handle the tokenization and language definitions.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: tokenize
```
