### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the ANSI-C quoting (`$'...'`) in the Bash code snippet is not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, the `\n` escape sequences within the quoted string are causing the highlighting to break, resulting in incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prism.js handles escape sequences within strings. The Bash grammar definition in `components/prism-bash.js` may not be correctly identifying or handling the `\n` escape sequences within the ANSI-C quoted string. This could be due to a missing or incorrect pattern for escape sequences in the Bash grammar.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core Prism.js file does not contain specific language definitions or handling for Bash, so it is not directly relevant to the issue.

#### --- components/prism-bash.js ---
```
components/prism-bash.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `components/prism-bash.js` defines the syntax highlighting rules for Bash. It includes patterns for strings and escape sequences, which are likely relevant to the issue. The function needs to be examined to ensure it correctly handles escape sequences within ANSI-C quoted strings.

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core initialization and utility functions in `components/prism-core.js` are not specific to Bash and do not directly handle language-specific syntax highlighting.

#### --- components/prism-markup.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in `components/prism-markup.js` handle inlined languages within markup and HTML attributes, which are not directly related to the Bash syntax highlighting issue.

#### --- plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The plugin for highlighting keywords does not directly relate to the handling of escape sequences within strings.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The only relevant location identified is:
```
components/prism-bash.js
function: function_1
```
This function defines the Bash syntax highlighting rules and should be inspected and potentially modified to correctly handle ANSI-C quoted strings and their escape sequences.
