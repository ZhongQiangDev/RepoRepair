### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the Prism.js highlight demo on the project homepage breaks when scrolling down to about 90% of the page. Specifically, a backtick (`) breaks the following code, causing the syntax highlighting to fail.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prism.js handles backticks in the code being highlighted. Backticks are used for template literals in JavaScript, and if they are not properly handled, they can disrupt the tokenization process. The problem might be related to how the `tokenize` function processes the code or how the `highlight` function handles the tokens.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js

This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the `tokenize` and `highlight` functions. These functions are directly involved in the tokenization and highlighting process, so they are relevant to the issue.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: tokenize
function: highlight
function: highlightElement
```

#### components/prism-js-extras.js

This file extends the JavaScript language definition in Prism.js. While it adds additional patterns for method variables, methods, and other JavaScript-specific tokens, it does not directly handle backticks or template literals. Therefore, it is less likely to be directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-js-templates.js

This file specifically handles template literals in JavaScript, including backticks. It is highly relevant to the issue.

```
components/prism-js-templates.js
function: createTemplate
```

#### plugins/unescaped-markup/prism-unescaped-markup.js

This file handles unescaped markup in `script[type='text/plain']` elements. It is not directly related to the handling of backticks or template literals in JavaScript code.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant files and functions/classes that need to be inspected or edited to fix the problem are:

```
components/prism-core.js
function: tokenize
function: highlight
function: highlightElement

components/prism-js-templates.js
function: createTemplate
```
