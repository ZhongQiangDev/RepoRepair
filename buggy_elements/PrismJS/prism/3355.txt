### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves incorrect syntax highlighting in `.cshtml` files when using Prism.js. Specifically:
- The `@Localize.GetLabelHtml("PLACEHOLDER")` and `@Localize.GetLabelHtml("TITLE")` expressions are not highlighted correctly.
- The `@helper` keyword and its associated code block are not highlighted properly.
- The `@{ ... }` code block is not highlighted as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect highlighting likely stems from the way Prism.js handles Razor/C# syntax in `.cshtml` files. The current grammar definitions in Prism.js may not fully account for Razor-specific constructs like `@helper`, `@{ ... }`, and `@` expressions within HTML attributes.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core utilities and highlighting functions in `prism-core.js` are generic and not specific to `.cshtml` syntax.

#### components/prism-cshtml.js
```
components/prism-cshtml.js
function: function_1
```
The `nested` function in `prism-cshtml.js` is relevant because it deals with nested patterns in Razor/C# syntax. However, it may not fully handle the specific constructs causing the highlighting issues.

#### components/prism-js-extras.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file modifies JavaScript language definitions and is not directly related to `.cshtml` syntax.

#### components/prism-markup-templating.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file handles templating expressions in markup languages but does not specifically address Razor/C# syntax.

#### components/prism-markup.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in `prism-markup.js` handle inlined languages within markup but do not specifically address the Razor/C# constructs causing the highlighting issues.

### Conclusion

The primary file that needs inspection or editing is `components/prism-cshtml.js`, specifically the `function_1` function. This function is responsible for generating patterns for matching nested brackets and Razor/C# syntax, and it may need adjustments to correctly handle the `@helper`, `@{ ... }`, and `@` expressions within HTML attributes.
