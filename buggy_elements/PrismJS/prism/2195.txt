### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that comments in Visual Basic code are not being highlighted correctly when they span multiple lines using the line continuation character (`_`). Specifically, the comment highlighting stops at the end of the first line, and the subsequent lines are not treated as part of the same comment.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the syntax highlighting rules for comments are defined. The regular expression used to match comments may not account for the line continuation character (`_`) at the end of a line, causing the highlighting to stop prematurely. The highlighting engine needs to recognize the line continuation character within comments and treat the entire multi-line comment as a single token.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-batch.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to Visual Basic, not batch scripting.

#### components/prism-core.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The core functionality of Prism.js is generic and does not specifically handle Visual Basic comments.

#### plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The plugin is for highlighting keywords, not comments.

#### plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The plugin is for preserving HTML markup during highlighting, not for handling comments.

### Relevant Files and Functions

Since none of the provided files directly relate to Visual Basic syntax highlighting, the relevant code is likely in a file defining the Visual Basic language grammar for Prism.js. However, based on the provided files, the closest relevant location would be in a hypothetical file defining the Visual Basic language grammar.

```
components/prism-vb.js
function: define_visual_basic_grammar
```

This hypothetical function would define the grammar rules for Visual Basic, including the rules for comments. The function would need to be modified to correctly handle line continuation characters within comments.
