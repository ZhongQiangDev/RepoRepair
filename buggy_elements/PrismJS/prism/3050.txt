### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description outlines the need to add support for the Mermaid language to the syntax highlighting system. The wrong behavior here is the absence of Mermaid language support in the current implementation. Specifically, the system cannot recognize and highlight Mermaid code snippets as it does for other languages like LaTeX, markup, etc.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the lack of a defined language grammar and highlighting rules for Mermaid within the Prism.js library. Prism.js uses language-specific grammar rules to tokenize and highlight code, and since Mermaid is not currently defined, the library cannot process and highlight Mermaid code snippets correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization, highlighting, DOM integration, language management, and the plugin system. To add support for Mermaid, we need to define its grammar and integrate it into the language management system.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- components/prism-latex.js ---
This file defines syntax highlighting rules for LaTeX, TeX, and Context languages. It is not directly related to adding Mermaid support, as Mermaid is a different language with its own syntax and grammar.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-markup-templating.js ---
This file handles markup templating by creating and managing placeholder tokens. While it deals with templating, it is not directly related to defining a new language like Mermaid.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-markup.js ---
This file contains functions for handling inlined languages within markup and modifying token attributes. While it deals with extending syntax highlighting capabilities, it is not directly related to defining a new language like Mermaid.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations
