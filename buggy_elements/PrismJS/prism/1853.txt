### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the JSON tokenization breaks when encountering a string value that starts with `/*`. The expected behavior is that the JSON should be tokenized correctly, treating `/*` as part of a string value rather than as the start of a comment. However, the current tokenization incorrectly interprets `/*` as the beginning of a comment, leading to improper highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the JSON grammar rules used by Prism.js. The grammar rules may not be correctly handling the case where `/*` appears within a string value. Specifically, the rules for string tokens may not be properly distinguishing between string content and comment delimiters.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization and highlighting. The `tokenize` function is responsible for breaking down the input text into tokens based on the provided grammar rules. Since the issue is related to tokenization, this file is relevant.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: tokenize
```

#### --- components/prism-markup.js ---
This file deals with extending Prism.js's syntax highlighting capabilities for inlined languages within markup. The issue described is specific to JSON tokenization and does not involve inlined languages within markup. Therefore, this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js ---
This file adds a hook to modify the highlighting of keyword tokens. The issue described is related to string tokenization, not keyword highlighting. Therefore, this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- plugins/normalize-whitespace/prism-normalize-whitespace.js ---
This file contains a function for normalizing whitespace in text. The issue described is related to tokenization and highlighting, not whitespace normalization. Therefore, this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
