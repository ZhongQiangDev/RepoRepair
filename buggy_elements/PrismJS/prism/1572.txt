### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description requests the addition of G-code syntax highlighting to Prism.js with the language identifier `gcode`. The wrong behavior is that Prism.js currently does not support G-code syntax highlighting, and the user wants this feature to be implemented.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the Prism.js library does not have a predefined language definition for G-code. The user has provided a sample implementation from another repository that can be used as a reference to add the G-code language definition to Prism.js. The implementation involves defining the syntax highlighting rules for comments, keywords, and properties specific to G-code.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### components/prism-asciidoc.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-bash.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-latex.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-markup.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to adding G-code syntax highlighting. However, based on the problem description and the provided implementation, the following steps should be taken:

1. Create a new file, e.g., `components/prism-gcode.js`, to define the G-code language.
2. Add the following code to the new file:

```javascript
Prism.languages.gcode = {
    comment: /;.*/,
    keyword: /\b(G[\d]+|M[\d]+)\b/g,
    property: /\b(X|Y|Z|E|F|S|P|T|I|J|D|H|R|Q|N|\*)/g
};
```

3. Ensure that the new file is included in the Prism.js build process so that the G-code language is recognized and can be used for syntax highlighting.
