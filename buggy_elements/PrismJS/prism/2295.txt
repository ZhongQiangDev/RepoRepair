### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that single-package package names (e.g., `package baz;`) are not being highlighted correctly in Java code. The screenshot shows that `package baz;` is not highlighted, while `package baz.zap;` and `import` statements are highlighted correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the `prism-java.js` file defines the grammar rules for Java. Specifically, the pattern for matching package declarations may not be correctly configured to handle single-package names. The `namespace` pattern in `prism-java.js` should ideally match both single-package and multi-package names.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core functionality of Prism does not directly handle language-specific highlighting rules, so it is not relevant to this issue.

#### --- components/prism-css.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for CSS, which is unrelated to the Java highlighting issue.

#### --- components/prism-java.js ---
```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `prism-java.js` is responsible for defining the Java language grammar rules. The `namespace` pattern within this function should be examined to ensure it correctly matches single-package names.

#### --- components/prism-js-extras.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file enhances JavaScript syntax highlighting and is not relevant to the Java highlighting issue.

#### --- plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This plugin is for highlighting keywords and does not directly affect the highlighting of package declarations.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The only relevant location is:
```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```
This function defines the Java language grammar rules, including the `namespace` pattern, which needs to be inspected and potentially modified to correctly highlight single-package names.
