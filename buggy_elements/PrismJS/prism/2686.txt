### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the syntax highlighting for the "Shell session" language is not working correctly in the more recent downloads of Prism.js (versions 1.22 and 1.23). Specifically, the shell session commands and their outputs are not being tokenized and highlighted as expected. Instead, the entire shell session text is being treated as a single token with the class `token output`, which results in no syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the language definition for "Shell session" in Prism.js. The problem could be due to changes in the language definition or the tokenizer logic that processes the shell session text. The issue might also be related to how the shell session language definition interacts with other components or plugins in Prism.js.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-bash.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is specific to the "Shell session" language, not the "Bash" language.

#### components/prism-core.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The core functionality of Prism.js is not directly related to the specific issue with the "Shell session" language.

#### components/prism-shell-session.js
```
components/prism-shell-session.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in this file defines the syntax highlighting rules for the "Shell session" language. The issue likely lies here, as the language definition may have been altered or is not being processed correctly.

#### plugins/command-line/prism-command-line.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The command-line plugin is not directly related to the "Shell session" language definition.

#### plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The keep-markup plugin is not directly related to the "Shell session" language definition.

### Conclusion

The relevant file and function that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
components/prism-shell-session.js
function: function_1
```

This function defines the syntax highlighting rules for the "Shell session" language and should be examined to identify and correct the issue with the tokenizer.
