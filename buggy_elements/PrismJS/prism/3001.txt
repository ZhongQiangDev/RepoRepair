### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that certain TypeScript keywords (`infer`, `type`) are incorrectly treated as keywords when followed by an alphabetic character. This results in incorrect highlighting for words like `inference` and `typeDefs`, where the initial part of the word (`infer` and `type`) is highlighted as a keyword.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the TypeScript language definition in Prism handles keyword matching. Specifically, the regular expressions used to match keywords may not be correctly excluding cases where the keyword is followed by an alphabetic character. This can lead to partial matches that incorrectly highlight parts of longer words.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core functionality of Prism does not directly handle language-specific keyword matching, so it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

#### components/prism-js-extras.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file enhances JavaScript syntax highlighting but does not specifically address TypeScript keywords or their matching rules.

#### components/prism-tsx.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file focuses on combining JSX and TypeScript syntax rules for TSX, but it does not directly handle keyword matching for TypeScript.

#### components/prism-typescript.js
```
components/prism-typescript.js
function: function_1
```
This file is highly relevant because it extends the JavaScript syntax to support TypeScript-specific features, including keyword handling. The issue likely lies in how the `keyword` patterns are defined and matched. Specifically, the function `function_1` is responsible for adding TypeScript keywords and their matching rules.

#### plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This plugin adds custom CSS classes for keywords but does not affect the keyword matching logic itself.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The primary location that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is:
```
components/prism-typescript.js
function: function_1
```
This function is responsible for defining and extending the TypeScript language definition, including the keyword matching rules. Adjustments to the regular expressions used for keyword matching should resolve the issue of partial matches within longer words.
