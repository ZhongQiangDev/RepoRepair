### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after a specific sequence of template literals and comments, the syntax highlighting for subsequent template literals breaks. Specifically:

- A regex containing a single quote followed by a template literal with a single quote renders correctly.
- A comment containing a template literal also renders correctly.
- However, after these two elements, any subsequent template literals are not highlighted correctly. The first template tag is ignored, and the highlighting for template literals is inverted for the rest of the file.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how the template literal parsing is handled within the Prism.js syntax highlighting logic. The issue seems to be related to the state of the parser after encountering the specific sequence of template literals and comments. The parser might be getting confused or stuck in a certain state, causing it to misinterpret subsequent template literals.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js

This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the main highlighting logic. The issue described is likely related to the highlighting logic, so this file is relevant.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

#### components/prism-js-extras.js

This file enhances JavaScript syntax highlighting by adding new patterns and aliases. While it adds additional patterns, it does not directly handle template literals. Therefore, it is less likely to be directly related to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-js-templates.js

This file specifically handles template literals and tagged templates. It is highly relevant to the issue described.

```
components/prism-js-templates.js
function: function_1
```

#### components/prism-jsdoc.js

This file enhances syntax highlighting for JSDoc comments. Since the issue is related to template literals and not JSDoc comments, this file is not directly relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
