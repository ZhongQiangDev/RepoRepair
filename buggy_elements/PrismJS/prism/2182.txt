### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the PrismJS syntax highlighter fails to correctly identify and highlight Elixir attributes that end with a `?`. Specifically, the attribute `attribute?:` in the provided Elixir code is not being recognized as a valid attribute name, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the regular expression used to identify attribute names in the Elixir grammar does not account for the optional `?` at the end of the attribute name. The current regex pattern is missing the optional question mark, which results in the `attribute?:` being incorrectly tokenized.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is specific to the Elixir language grammar and does not involve the core functionality of PrismJS.

#### components/prism-elixir.js

This file contains the relevant function that needs to be inspected and edited.

```
components/prism-elixir.js
function: function_1
```

The function `function_1` in `components/prism-elixir.js` is responsible for defining the grammar rules for the Elixir language. The specific line that needs to be modified is the regex pattern for the `attr-name` token. The current pattern does not include the optional `?` at the end of the attribute name, which is causing the incorrect highlighting.

To fix the issue, the regex pattern for `attr-name` should be updated to include the optional `?`:

```javascript
'attr-name': /\w+?\?:(?!:)/,
```

This change will ensure that attribute names ending with a `?` are correctly identified and highlighted.
