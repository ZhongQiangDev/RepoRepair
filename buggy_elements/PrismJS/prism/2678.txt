### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the Markdown parser needs to support image tokens. Specifically, it should be able to parse and render image syntax like `![emoji](https://content.markdowner.net/emoji/g/64/1f44d.png)` correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause behind the wrong behavior is that the current Markdown parser does not have the capability to recognize and process the image syntax. This means there is no existing function or class that handles the parsing of `![alt text](image_url)` and converts it into an appropriate HTML `<img>` tag.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-markdown.js
This file contains a function `function_1` which is responsible for creating regular expressions to match inline Markdown syntax. However, it does not mention anything about handling image syntax. Therefore, this function needs to be inspected and potentially modified to include support for image tokens.

```
components/prism-markdown.js
function: function_1
```

#### components/prism-markup.js
This file contains functions related to extending Prism.js's syntax highlighting capabilities for inlined languages within markup. It does not seem directly related to parsing Markdown image syntax.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### docs/scripts/collapse.js
This file contains a function `hideAllButCurrent` which is responsible for collapsing and expanding menu items based on the current page. It is not related to parsing Markdown image syntax.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### docs/scripts/linenumber.js
This file contains a function `function_1` which is responsible for adding line numbers to code blocks. It is not related to parsing Markdown image syntax.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### plugins/unescaped-markup/prism-unescaped-markup.js
This file contains a function `function_1` which is responsible for extending Prism.js functionality to handle unescaped markup. It does not seem directly related to parsing Markdown image syntax.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations
