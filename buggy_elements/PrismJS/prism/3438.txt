### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the URL string within the `@import` statement is not being highlighted correctly. Instead of treating the entire URL string as a single token, it is being broken down into multiple tokens, which results in incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the URL string is being parsed and tokenized by the syntax highlighting library. Specifically, the regular expression used to match URL strings in the CSS language definition may not be correctly capturing the entire URL string as a single token. This could be due to the presence of special characters or patterns within the URL that are being misinterpreted by the tokenizer.

components/prism-css.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `prism-css.js` is responsible for defining the CSS language rules, including the `url` pattern. This function likely needs to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that the URL string is correctly matched as a single token.
