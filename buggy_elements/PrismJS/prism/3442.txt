### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that quotes inside HTML attribute values are being highlighted as punctuation. For example, in the HTML snippet `<google-chart data='[["Month", "Days"], ["Jan", 31]]'></google-chart>`, the quotes within the `data` attribute value are being highlighted, which is unexpected and may not be desirable.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how Prism.js is tokenizing and highlighting the HTML attribute values. Specifically, the grammar rules for HTML attributes may be treating the quotes inside the attribute values as punctuation rather than as part of the string content. This could be due to the way the regular expressions or patterns are defined for matching and tokenizing HTML attributes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization and highlighting. The `tokenize` function and the `highlight` function are likely relevant to the issue since they handle the tokenization and highlighting of code snippets based on grammar rules.

```
components/prism-core.js
function: function_1
```

#### components/prism-js-extras.js
This file modifies the Prism.js language definition for JavaScript by inserting additional token patterns. Since the issue is related to HTML attributes and not JavaScript, this file is likely not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-markup-templating.js
This file handles markup templating by creating and managing placeholder tokens. While it deals with tokenization, it is more focused on templating expressions rather than HTML attributes. Therefore, it is likely not relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-markup.js
This file contains functions that extend Prism.js's syntax highlighting capabilities for inlined languages within markup and for languages embedded within HTML attributes. The `function_4` function specifically adds support for highlighting languages within HTML attributes, which is directly related to the issue.

```
components/prism-markup.js
function: function_4
```

#### plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
This file adds a hook for highlighting keywords during syntax highlighting. Since the issue is related to HTML attributes and not keywords, this file is likely not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations
