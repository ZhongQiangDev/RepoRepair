### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the keyword `isolated` in Swift function parameter types is not being highlighted as a keyword. The image provided shows `isolated` in a function parameter type context, and it should be highlighted as a keyword but is not.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely that the `isolated` keyword is not included in the list of recognized keywords for Swift in the Prism.js language definition. The Swift language definition in Prism.js needs to be updated to include `isolated` as a keyword so that it can be properly highlighted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, but it does not define language-specific rules.

#### components/prism-js-extras.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file modifies the Prism.js language definition for JavaScript, not Swift.

#### components/prism-swift.js
```
components/prism-swift.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains the Swift language definition for Prism.js. The `function_1` function is where the Swift language rules are defined. To fix the issue, the `isolated` keyword needs to be added to the list of recognized keywords in this file.

#### components/prism-typescript.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file modifies the Prism.js language definition for TypeScript, not Swift.

#### plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file adds a hook to add a CSS class to keyword tokens, but it does not define the keywords themselves.
