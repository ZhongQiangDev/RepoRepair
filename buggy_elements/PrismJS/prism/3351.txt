### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `UUID` class name in the Java code is not being highlighted correctly as a "class-name" token. Instead, it is being rendered as plain text, which is inconsistent with the expected highlighting behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the Java language definition in Prism not correctly identifying `UUID` as a class name. This could be due to the regular expression used for matching class names not being comprehensive enough to include `UUID` or due to an issue in the tokenization process where `UUID` is not being recognized as a class name.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core utilities and functions of Prism, but it does not define language-specific rules. Therefore, it is unlikely to be directly responsible for the issue with highlighting `UUID`. However, the `tokenize` function and the `highlightElement` function could be indirectly involved if there is a problem with how tokens are being processed.

#### --- components/prism-java.js ---
This file defines the language-specific rules for Java, including the `class-name` pattern. The issue is likely located here.

```

function: function_1
```

#### --- components/prism-js-extras.js ---
This file modifies the Prism.js language definition for JavaScript and is not relevant to the Java highlighting issue.
