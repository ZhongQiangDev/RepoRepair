### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the SQL comment (`-- this is a comment`) is not being correctly recognized and highlighted. Instead, it appears to be treated as part of the SQL query, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the SQL grammar rules are defined within the Prism.js library. Specifically, the grammar rules for SQL comments (`--`) may not be correctly set up to handle comments within SQL queries that are stored as strings in a database table. The grammar rules need to correctly identify the `--` as the start of a comment and ignore the content until the end of the line.
