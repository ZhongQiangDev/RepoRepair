### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a string in VB.NET code contains an '@' symbol within quotes, the syntax highlighting fails to recognize the opening quote correctly. This results in incorrect highlighting, as seen in the first line of the example where the string is not properly highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the string pattern used in the Prism library for VB.NET. The pattern does not currently account for the '@' symbol within quoted strings, leading to the incorrect recognition of the string boundaries. The suggested modification to the string pattern in the problem description aims to include '@' in the allowed characters within a string, which should resolve the issue.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of the Prism library, including tokenization and highlighting. The issue described is related to the string pattern used for tokenization, which is likely defined within this file or a language-specific file that extends it. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```

function: function_1
```

#### --- components/prism-regex.js ---
This file is specifically for adding regex-specific syntax highlighting rules to Prism. The issue described is related to string handling in VB.NET, not regex patterns. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the issue.
