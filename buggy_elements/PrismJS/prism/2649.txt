### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `#` symbol in the shell session code is incorrectly identified as a `shell-symbol` token, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. Specifically, the `#` symbol is being highlighted as if it were a command prompt symbol, rather than being treated as part of a command or comment.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for shell sessions in Prism.js. The rules for identifying `shell-symbol` tokens (such as `#` or `$`) may be too broad or not properly scoped, causing the `#` symbol within a command to be incorrectly matched as a `shell-symbol` rather than being treated as part of the command text.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### components/prism-bash.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to shell sessions, not Bash scripts.

#### components/prism-core.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to language-specific syntax highlighting rules, not the core highlighting logic.

#### components/prism-markup.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to shell sessions, not markup or inlined languages.

#### components/prism-shell-session.js
```
components/prism-shell-session.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in this file defines the syntax highlighting rules for shell sessions. The issue likely lies in the `command` rule, where the `shell-symbol` pattern may be incorrectly matching the `#` symbol within commands.

#### plugins/command-line/prism-command-line.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to syntax highlighting rules, not command-line features.
