### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the current implementation of Prism.js does not properly support Apex syntax highlighting. The issue arises because Apex is similar to Java but has its own unique syntax elements that are not being recognized. The current workaround of aliasing Apex to Java (`Prism.languages.apex = Prism.languages.java`) is insufficient as it fails to highlight Apex-specific syntax correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the existing Java language definition in Prism.js does not account for Apex-specific syntax elements. While Apex shares similarities with Java, it has unique keywords, data types, and syntax structures that are not covered by the Java definition. Therefore, simply aliasing Apex to Java results in incorrect or incomplete syntax highlighting for Apex code.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### components/prism-asciidoc.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-core.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-flow.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### components/prism-java.js
```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `prism-java.js` is relevant because it defines the syntax highlighting rules for Java. To support Apex, we need to extend or modify these rules to include Apex-specific syntax elements. This function will need to be inspected and potentially edited to add support for Apex.

#### components/prism-php.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
components/prism-java.js
function: function_1
```

This function will need to be inspected and potentially edited to add support for Apex-specific syntax elements. The modifications should include defining new keywords, data types, and syntax structures unique to Apex, ensuring that the highlighting rules accurately reflect the language's characteristics.
