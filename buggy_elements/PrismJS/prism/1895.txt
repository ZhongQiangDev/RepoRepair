### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that numeric literals containing underscores as numeric separators (e.g., `1_000_000_000_000` and `1_019_436_871.42`) are not being highlighted correctly by Prism.js. Instead of being recognized as valid numeric literals, they are likely being treated as invalid syntax or as a combination of numbers and unknown tokens.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the grammar rules in Prism.js not being updated to recognize the new JavaScript numeric separator syntax. The grammar rules for numeric literals in Prism.js need to be modified to include the underscore (`_`) as a valid separator within numbers. This would involve updating the regular expressions used to match numeric literals to include the underscore character in the appropriate places.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the `tokenize` and `highlight` functions. The issue is likely related to the grammar rules used for tokenizing the code. The `tokenize` function uses language-specific grammar rules to break down the input text into tokens. Therefore, the grammar rules for the JavaScript language need to be updated to recognize numeric separators.
