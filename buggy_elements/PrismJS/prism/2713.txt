### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that constants (`$from`) are incorrectly recognized as keywords in the JavaScript syntax highlighting. This results in the constants being highlighted with the wrong color or style, as shown in the provided screenshot.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the JavaScript grammar rules in the Prism library. Specifically, the grammar rules might be incorrectly classifying the `$from` identifier as a keyword instead of a variable or constant. This could be due to an overly broad regex pattern for keywords or a missing pattern for variables/constants.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of the Prism library, including tokenization, highlighting, and DOM integration. While it is essential for the overall highlighting process, it does not directly define the language-specific grammar rules. Therefore, it is unlikely to contain the specific issue related to the incorrect highlighting of constants.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-js-extras.js ---
This file modifies the Prism.js language definition for JavaScript by inserting additional token patterns. It specifically adds patterns for various JavaScript constructs, including keywords. The issue might be related to how keywords are defined or how variables/constants are handled.

```
components/prism-js-extras.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- components/prism-js-templates.js ---
This file is focused on generating regex patterns for tagged template literals in JavaScript. It does not directly relate to the definition of keywords or variables/constants. Therefore, it is unlikely to be relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- components/prism-jsdoc.js ---
This file modifies the Prism language definition to add support for JSDoc annotations. It does not directly relate to the definition of keywords or variables/constants in regular JavaScript code. Therefore, it is unlikely to be relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the most relevant location to inspect or edit to fix the problem is:

```
