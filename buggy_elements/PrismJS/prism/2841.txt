### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that string interpolation within a Ruby regex literal (`/foo#{bar}/`) is not being properly highlighted by Prism.js. However, when using the `%r` syntax (`%r[foo#{bar}]`), the interpolation is correctly highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prism.js handles regex literals in Ruby. Specifically, the regex literal `/.../` might not be correctly configured to recognize and highlight string interpolation (`#{...}`) within it. In contrast, the `%r` syntax is correctly configured to handle interpolation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core functionality of Prism.js does not directly handle language-specific syntax highlighting rules.

#### --- components/prism-markup.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with inlined languages within markup and does not directly relate to Ruby regex interpolation.

#### --- components/prism-regex.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file defines regex syntax highlighting rules but does not specifically handle Ruby's string interpolation within regex literals.

#### --- components/prism-ruby.js ---
```
components/prism-ruby.js
function: function_1
```
This file is where the Ruby language definition is set up. The issue likely lies within the regex patterns defined for Ruby. Specifically, the handling of interpolation within regex literals needs to be examined.

#### --- plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This plugin is for highlighting keywords and does not relate to the issue of regex interpolation highlighting.

### Conclusion

The relevant file and function to inspect and potentially edit is:
```
components/prism-ruby.js
function: function_1
```
This function defines the Ruby language rules, including regex patterns. The issue likely involves adjusting the regex pattern for standard regex literals (`/.../`) to correctly handle and highlight string interpolation (`#{...}`).
