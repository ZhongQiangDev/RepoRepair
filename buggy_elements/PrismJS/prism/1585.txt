### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a CSS value and the `!important` statement are specified together, the `!important` keyword is not recognized as a separate token. Instead, it is treated as part of the value, which leads to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the CSS language definition in Prism.js is set up. Specifically, the pattern for matching the `!important` keyword might not be correctly configured to handle cases where it is immediately adjacent to a CSS value. This could result in the `!important` keyword being included as part of the value token rather than being recognized as a separate `important` token.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- prism.js ---
```
prism.js

```

**Explanation:**
The `function_35` in `prism.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for CSS. The issue described is likely related to how the `important` token is defined within this function. Specifically, the pattern for matching the `!important` keyword needs to be adjusted to ensure it is recognized as a separate token when it appears immediately after a CSS value.
