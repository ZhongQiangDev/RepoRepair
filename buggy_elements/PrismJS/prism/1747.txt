### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the empty string `''` in the Smalltalk code is not being handled correctly by the syntax highlighter. Specifically, the text following the empty string is incorrectly highlighted as part of the string, when it should be treated as regular code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the grammar rules used by the syntax highlighter for Smalltalk. The highlighter is probably not correctly identifying the end of the empty string, causing it to incorrectly treat the subsequent text as part of the string. This could be due to a missing or incorrect pattern for matching empty strings in the language grammar.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- components/prism-core.js ---
This file contains the core functionality of the Prism library, including tokenization and highlighting. The issue described is likely related to the tokenization process, which is handled by the `tokenize` function. Therefore, this file is relevant.

```

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js ---
This file adds a hook to highlight keywords in the code. The issue described is related to string handling, not keyword highlighting, so this file is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
