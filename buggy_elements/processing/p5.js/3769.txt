### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a custom shader is used to create a geometry (in this case, a sphere), the render buffers for that geometry are created based on the attributes of the custom shader. If the custom shader does not have certain attributes (e.g., for normals or texture coordinates), the corresponding buffers are not created. Later, when a different shader (e.g., a fill shader that requires those attributes) is used to render the same geometry, the missing buffers cause the geometry to be rendered incorrectly or not at all.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the render buffers for a geometry are created at the time the geometry is first rendered, based on the attributes of the current shader. If the current shader does not require certain attributes (e.g., normals or texture coordinates), the corresponding buffers are not created. When a different shader that requires those attributes is later used to render the geometry, the missing buffers result in incorrect rendering.

### Explanation

- **src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js**:
  - `function_3`: This function initializes the WebGL context and sets up the rendering environment. It is relevant because it sets up the initial state of the renderer, which could affect how shaders and buffers are managed.
  - `function_30`: This function determines the fill shader to be used in retained mode. It checks the current rendering context and selects the appropriate shader, which is relevant to the issue of shader attribute compatibility.
  - `function_39`: This function sets the stroke uniforms for a shader, which is relevant to how shaders are configured and used.
  - `function_42`: This function configures the fill shader, which is relevant to how shaders are set up for rendering.

- **src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js**:
  - `function_3`: This function sets up WebGL buffers for rendering geometry. It binds shaders and creates buffers based on the current shader's attributes, which is directly related to the issue.
  - `function_4`: This function renders geometry buffers in WebGL. It checks whether stroke or fill rendering is enabled and processes the corresponding geometry buffers, which is relevant to the rendering process.

- **src/webgl/p5.Shader.js**:
  - `function_13`: This function checks if a shader is a texture shader, which is relevant to shader attribute checking.
  - `function_14`: This function checks if a shader can handle lighting, which is relevant to shader attribute checking.
  - `function_15`: This function checks if a shader is a stroke shader, which is relevant to shader attribute checking.
  - `function_16`: This function checks if a shader is a color shader, which is relevant to shader attribute checking.
  - `function_17`: This function checks if a shader is both a light shader and a texture shader, which is relevant to shader attribute checking.
