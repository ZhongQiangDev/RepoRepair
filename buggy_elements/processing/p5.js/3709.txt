### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the `tint()` function does not work in WebGL mode. The example code provided demonstrates that when `tint()` is called within the `draw()` function while using the WebGL renderer (`WEBGL`), the expected color tinting effect is not applied to the texture.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The `tint()` function is intended to modify the color of an image by applying a color filter. In the context of WebGL, this functionality might not be directly supported because WebGL operates differently from the 2D rendering context. WebGL requires shaders to handle color transformations, and the `tint()` function may not be properly integrated with the WebGL rendering pipeline.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/image/p5.Image.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/image/pixels.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js

```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
function: function_15
```

The `filter()` function in `p5.RendererGL.js` is relevant because it indicates that filtering operations are not supported in WebGL mode. This suggests that similar operations like `tint()` might also not be supported.

#### src/webgl/p5.Texture.js

```
src/webgl/p5.Texture.js
function: function_4
```

The `update` function in `p5.Texture.js` is relevant because it handles the updating of texture data. If `tint()` is not working, it might be due to the texture data not being updated correctly with the tinted color values.

### Summary

The relevant files and functions identified are:

```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
function: function_15

src/webgl/p5.Texture.js
function: function_4
```

These functions are likely involved in the issue because they relate to the handling of filters and texture updates in WebGL mode, which are crucial for the `tint()` function to work correctly.
