### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using WebGL mode in p5.js, the alpha blending of a semi-transparent red square on a black background is blending with the blue background of the page instead of the black background of the canvas. This results in an unexpected color appearance, as shown in the second image where the red square appears darker than expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is related to the WebGL context's `alpha` attribute. When `alpha` is set to `true` by default, the WebGL canvas allows the background of the page to show through the transparent parts of the canvas. This means that the semi-transparent red square is blending with the blue background of the page rather than the black background of the canvas. Setting `alpha` to `false` would prevent this blending with the page background, ensuring that the semi-transparent red square blends only with the black background of the canvas.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/core/p5.Graphics.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/core/rendering.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`
```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
function: function_2
function: function_6
```

- `function_2` (`_setAttributeDefaults`): This function initializes or merges default WebGL rendering attributes for a given p5.js instance. The `alpha` attribute is set to `true` by default, which is the cause of the issue. Changing this default value to `false` would fix the problem.
- `function_6` (`setAttributes`): This function allows developers to configure the WebGL rendering context. It can be used to set the `alpha` attribute to `false` if needed, but the default value is still set in `_setAttributeDefaults`.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
