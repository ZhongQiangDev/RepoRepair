### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `loadStrings` function in p5.js filters out empty lines when loading a text file, whereas the equivalent function in Processing includes empty lines in the array. This discrepancy causes issues when trying to match line numbers in shader files loaded by `loadShader`, as the line numbers in the source file do not align with those in the array returned by `loadStrings`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely in the implementation of the `loadStrings` function in p5.js. Specifically, the function may be processing the text file in a way that removes empty lines before splitting the content into an array of strings. This could be due to how the function handles whitespace or line endings when splitting the text into lines.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/addons/p5.dom.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/io/files.js ---
```
src/io/files.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
```

**Explanation:**
- `function_3` is the `loadStrings` function, which is directly related to the issue described. This function is responsible for loading a text file and splitting its contents into an array of strings. It is likely where the empty lines are being filtered out.
- `function_4` is another implementation of `loadStrings`, which may also be relevant if it is being used in certain contexts.

#### --- tasks/build/combineModules.js ---

### Summary of Relevant Functions

The relevant functions are located in `src/io/files.js`:
```
src/io/files.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
```

These functions need to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that empty lines are included in the array returned by `loadStrings`, matching the behavior of the equivalent function in Processing.
