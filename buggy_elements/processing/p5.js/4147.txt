### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the vertex colors in the WebGL mode are not being applied correctly in p5.js version 0.9.0. Specifically, the gradient effect expected from the different fill colors assigned to each vertex is not visible. Instead, the output appears as a single color or a uniform gradient, which does not match the expected output seen in version 0.8.0.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in how vertex colors are handled in the WebGL rendering pipeline between versions 0.8.0 and 0.9.0. This could involve changes in how colors are passed to the shaders, how they are interpolated across vertices, or how they are ultimately rendered on the screen. The problem might be related to the shader programs, the way vertex data is stored and passed, or the configuration of the WebGL context.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/color/p5.Color.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/core/shape/vertex.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`

```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: function_4
```

- `function_2`: This function handles the vertex creation in WebGL mode. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how vertex colors are being stored or passed.
- `function_3`: This function finalizes the shape drawing in WebGL mode. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how vertex colors are being processed during the final rendering.
- `function_4`: This function handles the drawing of filled shapes in immediate mode. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how vertex colors are being applied during the fill process.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`

```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
function: function_9
function: function_46
```

- `function_9`: This function sets the fill color for 3D geometry in WebGL mode. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how fill colors are being set or applied.
- `function_46`: This function configures the shader used for filling shapes in a WebGL rendering context. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how vertex colors are being configured in the shader.

#### `src/webgl/p5.Shader.js`

```
src/webgl/p5.Shader.js
function: function_13
function: function_18
```

- `function_13`: This function checks if the shader is a light shader. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how lighting affects vertex colors.
- `function_18`: This function checks if the shader is intended for stroking. It might be relevant if there is an issue with how stroke-related settings affect vertex colors.

### Summary

The identified functions and classes are likely involved in the handling and rendering of vertex colors in WebGL mode. The issue could be related to how vertex colors are stored, passed, or processed in the WebGL rendering pipeline. Further investigation into these functions and their interactions would be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem.
