### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` function does not produce the expected result when used in WebGL mode. Specifically, in WebGL mode, the overlapping area of the red and blue circles should appear as a darker color (black or dark purple) due to the multiplication of the colors, but instead, it appears as a solid blue color, indicating that the blending is not functioning as intended.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `blendMode` function is implemented in the WebGL renderer. In WebGL, blending is controlled using the `gl.blendFunc` and `gl.blendEquation` methods. The `blendMode(MULTIPLY)` should set the appropriate blending function to achieve the desired effect, but it seems that the blending function is not being set correctly or is not supported in the current implementation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/core/p5.Renderer2D.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes for WebGL mode.

#### `src/core/rendering.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes for WebGL mode.

#### `src/webgl/material.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes for the `blendMode` function.

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`

#### `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`

```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
function: function_16
function: function_17
```

- `function_16`: This function is responsible for setting the blend mode in the WebGL renderer. It checks if the specified blend mode is supported in WebGL and sets the appropriate blend function using `gl.blendFunc` and `gl.blendEquation`. If the blend mode is not supported, it issues a warning.
  
- `function_17`: This function applies the current blend mode settings to the WebGL context. It uses a `switch` statement to handle different blend modes and sets the appropriate blend function and equation.

These functions are directly related to the `blendMode` function in WebGL mode and should be inspected for any issues that might be causing the wrong behavior.
