### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `no-constant-condition` rule reports error ranges that are too broad. Instead of highlighting only the constant conditions (`true` in the examples provided), it highlights the entire statement or expression containing the constant condition.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `no-constant-condition` rule determines the range of the reported error. The rule is probably using the entire node's range (e.g., the entire `IfStatement` or `ConditionalExpression`) instead of narrowing down to the specific part of the node that represents the constant condition.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js ---

This file contains the `no-constant-condition` rule, which is directly related to the issue described. The following functions and methods are relevant:

```
lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js
function: create
```

The `create` function is responsible for defining the behavior of the rule. It includes several helper methods that analyze nodes and report issues. The issue likely lies in how the rule reports the location of the constant condition. Specifically, the `reportIfConstant` method or similar logic within the `create` function may need to be adjusted to report only the range of the constant condition.
