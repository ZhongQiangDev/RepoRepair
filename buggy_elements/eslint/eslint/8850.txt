### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `indent` rule incorrectly reporting indentation errors for JSX binary expressions when using parentheses. Specifically, the code snippet provided in the problem description is expected to pass without errors in ESLint version 4.0 but fails in version 4.1.1 with the following errors:

- Line 6 and 7: Expected indentation of 16 spaces but found 20.
- Line 8: Expected indentation of 12 spaces but found 16.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be a regression in the `indent` rule's handling of JSX binary expressions when they are wrapped in parentheses. The rule is incorrectly calculating the expected indentation levels for these expressions, leading to false positives. This issue seems to be related to how the rule processes nested structures within JSX and how it handles the additional parentheses.

#### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
lib/rules/indent-legacy.js
function: create

lib/rules/indent.js
function: create
class: OffsetStorage
class: TokenInfo
```

The `create` function in both `indent-legacy.js` and `indent.js` is responsible for implementing the `indent` rule, which is where the issue likely resides. The `OffsetStorage` and `TokenInfo` classes in `indent.js` are also relevant as they manage token offsets and indentation information, which could be contributing to the incorrect indentation calculations.
