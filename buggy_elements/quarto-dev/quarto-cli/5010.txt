### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that non-standard URLs (containing commas and other punctuation) display correctly inline within a blog post but do not display correctly in the image grid view. This suggests an issue with how URLs are processed or rendered in the grid view compared to the inline display.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how URLs are handled in the grid view. The grid view might be applying additional URL processing or validation that fails for non-standard URLs. This could involve URL encoding, protocol checking, or other URL normalization steps that are not applied consistently between the inline display and the grid view.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/core/image.ts`

This file contains functions related to image handling, such as determining content types and sizes. While these functions are important for image processing, they do not directly handle URL processing or rendering. Therefore, this file likely does not contain the relevant functions for the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/core/url.ts`

This file contains functions that process and manipulate URLs, which are directly relevant to the issue described.

```
src/core/url.ts
function: ensureProtocolAndTrailingSlash
function: isHttpUrl
function: joinUrl
```

#### `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/paths.ts`

This file contains functions related to path manipulation and does not directly handle URL processing or rendering. Therefore, this file likely does not contain the relevant functions for the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/core/pandoc/pandoc-id.ts`

This file contains functions related to generating identifiers and does not directly handle URL processing or rendering. Therefore, this file likely does not contain the relevant functions for the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing-shared.ts`

This file contains type definitions and functions related to website listing and does not directly handle URL processing or rendering. Therefore, this file likely does not contain the relevant functions for the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant functions that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are located in `src/core/url.ts`. These functions handle URL processing and may need to be adjusted to ensure consistent handling of non-standard URLs in both inline display and grid view.
