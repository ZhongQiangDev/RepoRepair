### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Markdown list generated by the `pander` package is not correctly formatted. Specifically, the list items are incorrectly nested, with sub-bullets introduced where they should not be. The expected output should be a flat list, but the actual output shows nested list items.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to be related to how the `pander` package formats the list when it is embedded within a Markdown document. The problem seems to occur during the conversion of the R output to Markdown, which is then processed by Pandoc. The intermediary Markdown file generated by the `pander` package introduces sub-bullets, which are not present in the original R code or the final HTML output when using `knitr::knit`.

### Relevant Files and Functions

The issue is likely related to how the `pander` package formats the list and how Pandoc processes the Markdown. However, the provided files do not contain any functions or classes directly related to the `pander` package or the specific Markdown formatting issue. The problem might be within the `pander` package itself or in the interaction between `pander` and Pandoc.

Since the provided files do not contain relevant functions or classes, the locations that need inspection or editing are likely outside the provided files. The relevant locations would be within the `pander` package and possibly within Pandoc's Markdown processing logic.

### Summary
