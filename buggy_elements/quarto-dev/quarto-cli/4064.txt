### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when using percentage values for `width` and `height` in the Reveal.js configuration within a Quarto document, the presentation does not render correctly and results in a blank screen. However, when using pixel values, the presentation renders as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Reveal.js or the Quarto rendering engine handles percentage values for `width` and `height`. Specifically, the problem might be related to how these values are processed and applied to the presentation's CSS. The percentage values might not be properly quoted or formatted, leading to a failure in the rendering process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts ---
```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
function: revealHtmlPostprocessor
function: revealjsFormat
function: revealResolveFormat
```

The `revealHtmlPostprocessor` function is responsible for processing the document and applying various transformations for Reveal.js. It might need to ensure that percentage values for `width` and `height` are properly handled and quoted. The `revealjsFormat` function sets up the Reveal.js format, and `revealResolveFormat` processes metadata, which might include the `width` and `height` settings.
