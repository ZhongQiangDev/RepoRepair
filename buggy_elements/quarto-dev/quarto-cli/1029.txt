### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `aside` class is used on a slide with a single figure, the figure is stretched too much, and the `aside` content overlaps the bottom of the figure. If the figure has a caption, the caption even goes below the `aside` content. The desired behavior is for the `aside` content to have priority and always take the bottom part of the slide, with the figure stretching only to the top of the `aside` block.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the CSS styling and layout management of the `aside` class and the `r-stretch` class. The `r-stretch` class is responsible for stretching images to fit the slide, but it seems to be conflicting with the `aside` class, which is supposed to reserve space at the bottom of the slide for additional content. The issue might be related to how the CSS rules for these classes are defined and applied, particularly in terms of their positioning and z-index.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `src/format/reveal/format-reveal-theme.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts`

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
function: applyStretch
function: revealHtmlPostprocessor
```

- **`applyStretch`**: This function is responsible for applying the `r-stretch` class to images under specific conditions. It might be relevant because it determines how images are stretched on slides, which could be conflicting with the `aside` class.
- **`revealHtmlPostprocessor`**: This function handles various post-processing tasks for Reveal.js presentations, including image stretching. It might be relevant because it could be responsible for the overall layout and positioning of elements on slides.

#### `src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/math/math.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/notes/plugin.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/search/plugin.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary

The functions `applyStretch` and `revealHtmlPostprocessor` in `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts` are likely relevant to the issue described in the GitHub problem. These functions handle the stretching of images and the overall post-processing of slides, which could be causing the conflict with the `aside` class.
