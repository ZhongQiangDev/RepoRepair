### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem involves issues with processing markdown in callout block captions when rendering to PDF. Specifically:

- **Special Characters in Captions**: When special characters (like `%<-%`) are used in the caption, they cause errors because they are not properly escaped for LaTeX.
- **Markdown Formatting in Captions**: Markdown formatting (like bold text `**strong**` or code blocks ``code``) in the caption is not processed correctly, resulting in plain text output without the intended formatting.
- **Commas in Captions**: Commas in the caption text cause LaTeX to interpret them as option separators, leading to errors.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues appears to be related to how the Lua filter processes the callout block captions:

- **Lack of Markdown Processing**: The current implementation uses `pandoc.utils.stringify()` on the caption content, which does not process markdown. This results in the raw markdown text being passed to LaTeX, causing formatting issues.
- **Improper Escaping**: Special characters in the caption are not properly escaped for LaTeX, leading to syntax errors.
- **Handling of Commas**: Commas in the caption are not handled correctly, causing LaTeX to misinterpret them as option separators.
