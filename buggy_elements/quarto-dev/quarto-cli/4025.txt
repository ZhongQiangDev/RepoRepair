### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that a single Bokeh plot is being incorrectly identified as multiple subfigures (1b and 1c), which should not exist. The output shows subfigures (b) and (c) with placeholder captions `?(caption)` that are not associated with any actual content.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the rendering process handles the Bokeh plot. It seems that the rendering engine is misinterpreting the single plot as multiple subfigures, possibly due to incorrect metadata or figure handling logic. This could be related to how the figure caption and subfigure labels are being processed or how the Bokeh plot is being embedded in the document.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/command/render/render-files.ts ---

This file contains functions related to rendering files using Pandoc and managing the rendering process. The following functions could be relevant:

```
src/command/render/render-files.ts
function: renderFiles
function: renderExecute
function: defaultPandocRenderer
```

- `renderFiles`: This function is responsible for rendering a list of files into their respective output formats using Pandoc. It could be relevant if there is an issue with how the Bokeh plot is being processed during rendering.
- `renderExecute`: This function handles the execution of computations during the rendering process. It might be relevant if the Bokeh plot is being executed and rendered incorrectly.
- `defaultPandocRenderer`: This function handles the rendering of executed files using Pandoc. It could be relevant if there is an issue with how the Bokeh plot is being rendered.

#### --- src/command/render/render-shared.ts ---

This file contains utility functions for rendering and previewing. It does not seem directly related to the issue:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/handlers/base.ts ---

This file contains functions related to handling language cells and generating HTML attributes. The following functions could be relevant:

```
src/core/handlers/base.ts
function: build
function: handleLanguageCells
function: makeHandlerContext
```

- `build`: This function processes a Quarto markdown cell to create a structured block. It could be relevant if there is an issue with how the Bokeh plot cell is being processed.
- `handleLanguageCells`: This function handles markdown cells by categorizing them based on their language type. It might be relevant if the Bokeh plot cell is being categorized incorrectly.
- `makeHandlerContext`: This function initializes a context object for handling cells. It could be relevant if there is an issue with how the context is being set up for the Bokeh plot.

#### --- src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/web-worker-manager.ts ---

This file contains functions related to web workers and remote function execution. It does not seem directly related to the issue:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/lib/yaml-schema/project-config.ts ---

This file contains functions related to YAML schema validation and error handling. It does not seem directly related to the issue:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
