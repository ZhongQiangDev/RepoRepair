### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when `hash-type: number` is used in the reveal.js format, the title slide's content is misaligned. Specifically, the title, subtitle, author, and date are not centered as expected, unlike when `hash-type: title` is used.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment issue likely stems from how the `hash-type` setting affects the CSS or HTML structure of the title slide. The `hash-type: number` setting might introduce additional elements or styles that interfere with the centering of the title slide content. This could be due to improper handling of the hash type in the theme or post-processing steps.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/format/reveal/format-reveal-theme.ts`

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-theme.ts
function: pandocVariablesToRevealDefaults
function: pandocVariablesToThemeScss
function: revealTheme
```

These functions are responsible for processing metadata and converting it into SCSS variables and layers, which are then used to style the presentation. The issue might be related to how the `hash-type` metadata is processed and applied to the theme.

#### `src/format/reveal/format-reveal-title.ts`

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal-title.ts
function: titleSlideScss
function: titleSlidePartial
```

These functions handle the SCSS and HTML templates for the title slide. The misalignment could be due to incorrect SCSS being applied or an incorrect HTML template being used based on the `hash-type`.

#### `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts`

```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
function: revealHtmlPostprocessor
function: revealjsFormat
```

The `revealHtmlPostprocessor` function processes the HTML document and applies various configurations, including handling the title slide. The `revealjsFormat` function sets up the format configuration, which might include the `hash-type` setting.

#### `src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/markdown/plugin.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

This file is related to extracting markdown content from slide sections and is not directly related to the title slide alignment issue.

#### `src/resources/library/dayjs/locale/en.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

This file is related to generating ordinal suffixes for numbers and is not relevant to the title slide alignment issue.
