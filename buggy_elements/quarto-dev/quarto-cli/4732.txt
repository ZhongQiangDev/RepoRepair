### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when using the `revealjs` format with the `knitr` engine, the embedded code from an external file (`code.R`) is not displayed in the generated HTML output. Instead, the HTML contains an empty `<div>` element where the code should be. However, when using a format other than `revealjs`, the embedded code is displayed correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `revealjs` format handles embedded code blocks when using the `knitr` engine. The `knitr` engine is responsible for processing the R code and embedding it into the document, but the `revealjs` format may not be correctly handling the embedded content. This could be due to differences in how `revealjs` processes HTML content compared to other formats, or it could be related to how the `knitr` engine interacts with the `revealjs` format.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/command/render/codetools.ts ---
```
src/command/render/codetools.ts
function: codeToolsPostprocessor
function: formatHasCodeTools
function: keepSourceBlock
function: resolveCodeTools
function: resolveKeepSource
```

These functions are related to processing and embedding code blocks in the document. The `codeToolsPostprocessor` function, in particular, might need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles embedded code blocks when using the `revealjs` format. The `formatHasCodeTools` function determines if code tools should be rendered, which could be relevant if the `revealjs` format is not properly enabling code tools. The `keepSourceBlock` function processes the source code for embedding, and `resolveCodeTools` and `resolveKeepSource` functions resolve and configure code tools, which might need to be adjusted for the `revealjs` format.

#### --- src/command/render/render.ts ---
```
src/command/render/render.ts
function: renderPandoc
function: runHtmlPostprocessors
function: markdownWithPandocIncludes
function: mergePandocIncludes
function: PandocRenderCompletion
```

The `renderPandoc` function orchestrates the rendering process using Pandoc, which could be relevant if there are issues with how Pandoc is processing the embedded code blocks for the `revealjs` format. The `runHtmlPostprocessors` function applies postprocessors to the HTML content, which might need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles embedded code blocks. The `markdownWithPandocIncludes` function processes includes in the Markdown content, which could be relevant if there are issues with including the embedded code. The `mergePandocIncludes` and `PandocRenderCompletion` functions manage includes and rendering completion, which might need to be adjusted for the `revealjs` format.

#### --- src/core/knitr.ts ---
```
src/core/knitr.ts
function: knitrCapabilities
function: knitrCapabilitiesMessage
function: knitrInstallationMessage
function: KnitrRequiredPackages
function: rInstallationMessage
```

This file contains functions related to the `knitr` package and its capabilities. While these functions are important for ensuring that `knitr` is properly set up and available, they are not directly related to the issue of embedding code blocks in the `revealjs` format. Therefore, this file contains no relevant functions/classes for the specific issue described.

#### --- src/core/handlers/base.ts ---
```
src/core/handlers/base.ts
function: build
function: cell
function: document
function: documentEnd
function: documentStart
function: getDivAttributes
function: handleLanguageCells
function: install
function: languages
function: languageSchema
function: makeHandlerContext
function: resetFigureCounter
```

The `build` function processes Quarto markdown cells, which could be relevant if there are issues with how cells are being processed for the `revealjs` format. The `cell` function returns the raw content of a Quarto markdown cell, which might need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles embedded code blocks. The `document`, `documentEnd`, and `documentStart` functions manage document processing, which could be relevant if there are issues with how the document is being processed for the `revealjs` format. The `getDivAttributes` function generates HTML attributes and classes, which might need to be adjusted for the `revealjs` format. The `handleLanguageCells` function categorizes and handles language-specific cells, which could be relevant if there are issues with how language-specific cells are being handled for the `revealjs` format. The `install`, `languages`, `languageSchema`, `makeHandlerContext`, and `resetFigureCounter` functions are not directly related to the issue of embedding code blocks in the `revealjs` format.

#### --- src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts ---
```
src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts
function: applyClassesToParentSlide
function: applyStretch
function: findParentSlide
function: removeClassesFromParentSlide
function: revealHtmlPostprocessor
function: revealjsFormat
function: revealMarkdownAfterBody
function: revealResolveFormat
```

The `revealHtmlPostprocessor` function processes the HTML content for the `revealjs` format, which could be relevant if there are issues with how the HTML content is being processed for the `revealjs` format. The `revealjsFormat` function sets up the `revealjs` format, which might need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles embedded code blocks. The `revealMarkdownAfterBody` function generates content for the `revealjs` format, which could be relevant if there are issues with how content is being generated for the `revealjs` format. The `revealResolveFormat` function resolves the `revealjs` format, which might need to be adjusted for the `revealjs` format. The `applyClassesToParentSlide`, `applyStretch`, `findParentSlide`, `removeClassesFromParentSlide` functions are related to manipulating the DOM for slides, which might need to be inspected to ensure they correctly handle embedded code blocks.
