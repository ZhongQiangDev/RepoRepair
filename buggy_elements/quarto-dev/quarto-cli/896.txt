### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that images are not being placed correctly within custom divs in a Reveal.js presentation. Specifically, when an image is placed inside a custom div with a class (e.g., `.qrcodeblock` or `.anotherblocks`), the image is rendered outside the div instead of inside it. This issue does not occur when the image is placed within a column layout.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how Reveal.js or the underlying HTML/CSS is handling the custom divs. The issue could be due to:

- Incorrect HTML structure generation when custom divs are used.
- CSS styling issues that cause the image to be pushed outside the div.
- A bug in the Reveal.js rendering process that affects custom divs but not column layouts.
