### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect rendering of the table when a caption is added. Specifically:
- The table headers and subheaders are misaligned.
- The table layout is distorted, with the subheader "Subheader" not spanning correctly over the columns "x" and "y".
- The table appears to be stretched horizontally, which is not the desired output.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to be related to how the table is processed and rendered when a caption is added. The presence of the caption might be interfering with the CSS styling or the table processing logic, causing the layout to break. This could be due to:
- Incorrect CSS styles being applied when a caption is present.
- A bug in the table processing logic that fails to handle captions correctly.
- An issue with how the table is being converted to HTML, particularly with the spanners and captions.

### Relevant Functions/Classes

Based on the analysis, the issue is likely related to the table processing and rendering logic, which is not directly covered by the provided functions. However, if we assume that the table processing logic might be related to the `pandocBlock` or `pandocHtmlBlock` functions, we can infer the following:

```
src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts
function: pandocBlock
function: pandocHtmlBlock
```

These functions might be involved in generating the HTML for the table, and any issues with handling captions or spanners could be addressed here. However, without more specific information about the table processing logic, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact functions or classes responsible.
