### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect labeling of subfigures when cross-reference information is not explicitly provided. In the first example, the subfigures are labeled as separate figures (Figure 1 and Figure 2), which is incorrect. In the second example, where cross-reference information is provided, the subfigures are correctly labeled as subfigures (a) and (b) under a single figure (Figure 1).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that Quarto does not automatically generate cross-reference information for subfigures unless explicitly provided. This results in each subfigure being treated as a separate figure, leading to incorrect labeling. When cross-reference information is provided, Quarto correctly handles the subfigures as part of a single figure.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/command/render/crossref.ts`

This file contains functions related to cross-referencing. The functions `crossrefFilter`, `crossrefFilterActive`, `crossrefFilterParams`, and `crossrefOption` are relevant to the issue because they handle the generation and processing of cross-reference information.

```
src/command/render/crossref.ts
function: crossrefFilter
function: crossrefFilterActive
function: crossrefFilterParams
function: crossrefOption
```

#### `src/command/render/filters.ts`

This file contains functions related to various filters used in the rendering process. The function `filterParamsJson` is relevant because it aggregates metadata and parameters for use in Pandoc filtering, which includes cross-reference parameters.

```
src/command/render/filters.ts
function: filterParamsJson
```

#### `src/command/render/latexmk/latexmk.ts`

This file contains functions related to the `latexmk` tool for generating PDFs. While it is involved in the rendering process, it does not directly handle cross-referencing. Therefore, it contains no relevant functions/classes.
