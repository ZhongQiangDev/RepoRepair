### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the combination of `panel-tabset` and `nav-fill` does not render correctly in the newer version of Quarto (1.3.146). Specifically, the tabs are not displayed side by side with equal width as expected when using `nav-fill`. Instead, they are stacked vertically.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to be related to how the `nav-fill` class is applied to the `panel-tabset`. In the older version (1.2.335), the `nav-fill` class works as expected, causing the tabs to stretch and fill the available horizontal space. However, in the newer version (1.3.146), the `nav-fill` class does not seem to be applied correctly, resulting in the tabs being stacked vertically.

### Explanation

The `function_3` in `tabby.js` is the constructor function responsible for initializing the tabbed interface. This function sets up the tab behavior and manages the display of tabs. Given that the issue is related to the display of tabs, it is likely that the problem lies within this function or the associated CSS styles that it applies.

The other files do not contain functions or classes directly related to the rendering of tabsets or the application of the `nav-fill` class. Therefore, they are not relevant to the issue described.
