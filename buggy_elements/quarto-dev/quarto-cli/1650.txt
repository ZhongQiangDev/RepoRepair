### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that there is an unexpected blank line at the top of the code chunk when using `echo: true` or `echo: fenced` with Mermaid and Dot chunks in a Quarto document. This issue is observed in the output, as shown in the provided screenshots.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the blank line issue likely stems from how the code chunks are being processed and rendered. Specifically, the problem might be related to how the `echo` option is handled in the rendering process. When `echo: true` or `echo: fenced` is set, the code chunk is supposed to be displayed in the output, but an extra blank line is being added at the top.
