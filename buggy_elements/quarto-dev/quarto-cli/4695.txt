### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that links in the `index.qmd` file, which work correctly in the local preview, do not appear as links when the content is rendered on Confluence. Instead, the text appears without any hyperlink functionality.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the links are being processed or rendered when the content is transferred from the local environment to Confluence. Possible causes include:
- Incorrect handling of relative paths in the Confluence environment.
- Confluence's rendering engine not recognizing or properly interpreting the Markdown links.
- Issues with the way the HTML is being generated or transformed for Confluence.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/core/http-devserver.ts`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/core/http.ts`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/core/url.ts`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/project/project-shared.ts`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/project/types/website/website-resources.ts`

```
src/project/types/website/website-resources.ts
function: htmlResourceResolverPostprocessor
function: resolveResourceRefs
function: resolveTag
```

These functions are relevant because they handle the resolution and processing of resource references (including links) in HTML documents. Specifically:
- `htmlResourceResolverPostprocessor` processes HTML documents and resolves relative resource paths.
- `resolveResourceRefs` identifies and resolves all resource references in an HTML document.
- `resolveTag` processes HTML elements of a specified tag and attribute, resolving their paths.

These functions could be involved in how links are handled and might need to be inspected to ensure they correctly process and resolve links for the Confluence environment.
