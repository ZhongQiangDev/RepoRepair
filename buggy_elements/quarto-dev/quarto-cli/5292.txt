### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the code annotation feature does not work correctly for PDF outputs in Quarto version 1.3.336. Specifically:

- The `tikz` package is not included, which is necessary for certain types of annotations.
- The `\circled` command is not defined, which is likely used for creating circled numbers or symbols in the code annotations.
- Defining the `\circled` command in the preamble of the document only partially resolves the issue, as it works within the code block but not for the stylized list elements below it.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely stems from the following:

- **Missing TikZ Package**: The `tikz` package is not being included in the LaTeX preamble, which is necessary for certain types of annotations.
- **Undefined `\circled` Command**: The `\circled` command is not defined in the document preamble, which is required for creating circled numbers or symbols.
- **Partial Fix**: Defining the `\circled` command in the preamble only works within the code block but not for the stylized list elements, indicating a possible issue with how the annotations are being processed or rendered outside of the code blocks.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/command/render/filters.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/command/render/latexmk/latexmk.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/command/render/latexmk/parse-error.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/core/lib/external/colors.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Relevant Functions/Classes

Based on the analysis, the issue seems to be related to the inclusion of LaTeX packages and the definition of commands in the preamble. The relevant files and functions are likely located in the LaTeX-related rendering and configuration parts of the Quarto codebase, which are not listed in the provided "Relevant Files Information." However, based on the provided files, none of them directly relate to the issue described.

If we were to speculate on where the relevant functions might be located, they could be in files related to:

- LaTeX preamble generation.
- Pandoc filter configuration for PDF outputs.
- Code block annotation handling.

Since none of the provided files contain relevant functions, the answer is:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
