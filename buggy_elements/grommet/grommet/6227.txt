### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a required field is dynamically removed from the form by toggling a checkbox, the form remains invalid even though all other fields are valid. This indicates that the form validation state is not being updated correctly when fields are dynamically added or removed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the form validation state is managed when fields are dynamically added or removed. Specifically, the validation state may not be properly reset or updated when a required field is removed, causing the form to retain an invalid state even if all remaining fields are valid.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/CheckBox/CheckBox.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/Form/Form.js`

```
src/js/components/Form/Form.js
function: function_10
```

The `function_10` is the main React component that manages the form state, validation, and submission. It is responsible for handling dynamic forms, including adding/removing fields. The issue may be related to how the form state is updated when fields are dynamically removed.

#### `src/js/components/Form/stories/DynamicFields.js`

```
src/js/components/Form/stories/DynamicFields.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` is a React component that demonstrates dynamic form behavior. It toggles the visibility of an additional "Alias" text input field based on a checkbox. This component may be relevant to the issue as it demonstrates the dynamic addition/removal of fields.

#### `src/js/components/Form/stories/ValidateOnChange.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js`

```
src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js
function: function_12
```

The `function_12` is a React component that renders a form field with extensive customization options. It integrates with the FormContext and handles validation. This component may be relevant to the issue as it manages individual form fields and their validation states.
