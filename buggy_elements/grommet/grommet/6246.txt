### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `DataChart` component fails to render bars when the data includes negative values. Instead of displaying the bars correctly, the chart shows nothing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `DataChart` component handles negative values in the data. The component may not be properly configured to render bars for negative values, or it might be missing logic to handle negative values appropriately. Additionally, the component may not be rendering a zero line guide as expected when negative values are present.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js`

This file contains the main `DataChart` component, which is responsible for rendering the chart. Given the problem description, this file is highly relevant because it processes the data and configurations to produce the visual representation.

````
src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js
function: function_1
````

#### `src/js/components/DataChart/YAxis.js`

This file contains the `YAxis` component, which is responsible for rendering the Y-axis of the chart. While this component is important for displaying the scale and formatting of the axis labels, it is less likely to be directly responsible for the issue with rendering bars for negative values.

````
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
````

#### `src/js/components/DataChart/stories/Offset.js`

This file contains a story for the `DataChart` component, demonstrating how to use it with specific configurations. While this file is useful for testing and examples, it is not directly responsible for the issue.

````
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the primary location that needs inspection or editing is:

````
src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js
function: function_1
````

This function should be examined to ensure it correctly handles negative values in the data and renders the bars appropriately. Additionally, it should be checked to ensure it renders a zero line guide as expected when negative values are present.
