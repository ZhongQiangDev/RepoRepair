### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `PageHeader` heading with a long string overflows instead of wrapping when it runs out of space. This causes the heading to collide with other content, such as the subtitle or actions.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the CSS styling of the `title` prop within the `PageHeader` component. Specifically, the `Heading` component used to render the title may not have the appropriate CSS properties set to ensure text wrapping. The `white-space` property might be set to `nowrap`, or the `word-break` and `overflow-wrap` properties might not be configured correctly.
