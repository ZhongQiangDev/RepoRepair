### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when sorting a column in a DataTable, items are not reordered as expected if an item in the table has a property set to `null` or `undefined`. Specifically, the sorting breaks when encountering these values.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from the sorting logic not handling `null` or `undefined` values correctly. When comparing values during sorting, encountering `null` or `undefined` can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, as these values do not compare naturally with other values.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js
function: function_9
```

The `function_9` function in `buildState.js` filters and sorts data based on provided filters and sorting criteria, which is relevant to the cause.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/Cell.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
function: function_3
```

The `function_3` function in `DataTable.js` handles the main logic for the DataTable component, including sorting. The sorting logic is likely where the issue lies, as it needs to handle `null` or `undefined` values appropriately.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function in `Sorter.js` handles the column header and sorting functionality. While it triggers sorting, the actual sorting logic is likely handled elsewhere, but this function is still relevant as it initiates the sorting process.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Sort.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
