### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description highlights the absence of a `DataTableGroup` component, which would allow users to select a `groupBy` value for the `DataTable`. The current implementation uses a `Select` component to achieve this functionality, but it is not a dedicated `DataTableGroup` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the lack of a specific `DataTableGroup` component in the existing codebase. This component would encapsulate the logic for selecting a `groupBy` value and integrating it seamlessly with the `DataTable`. The current workaround using a `Select` component is not ideal and does not provide a cohesive user experience.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Data/Data.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/Data/stories/Controlled.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
function: function_3
```

The `function_3` function in `DataTable.js` is relevant because it defines the `DataTable` component, which includes the `groupBy` prop. This prop is used to specify how the data should be grouped. To implement the `DataTableGroup` component, we would need to modify this function to accept and handle the `groupBy` value selected by the `DataTableGroup` component.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/ControlledGrouped.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/stories/ControlledGrouped.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function in `ControlledGrouped.js` is relevant because it demonstrates how the `DataTable` component can be used with grouped data. This function manages the state of expanded groups and passes the `groupBy` prop to the `DataTable` component. To implement the `DataTableGroup` component, we would need to modify this function to use the `DataTableGroup` component for selecting the `groupBy` value.

#### `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Grouped.js`

```
src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Grouped.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` function in `Grouped.js` is relevant because it demonstrates how the `DataTable` component can be used with grouped data. This function passes the `groupBy` prop to the `DataTable` component. To implement the `DataTableGroup` component, we would need to modify this function to use the `DataTableGroup` component for selecting the `groupBy` value.

### Summary

To fix the problem, we need to create a new `DataTableGroup` component and integrate it with the existing `DataTable` component. The relevant files and functions that need to be inspected or edited are:

1. `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`
   - `function_3`
2. `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/ControlledGrouped.js`
   - `function_1`
3. `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Grouped.js`
   - `function_1`
