### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the arrow icon for the Select component is not visible when the background is dark. This suggests that the icon's color or visibility is not properly adjusted for dark backgrounds.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the styling of the arrow icon not being adjusted for dark mode. This could be due to:
- The icon's color being too light or transparent, making it invisible against a dark background.
- The icon's visibility or opacity not being set correctly for dark mode.
- The theme configuration not properly applying the necessary styles for the icon in dark mode.
