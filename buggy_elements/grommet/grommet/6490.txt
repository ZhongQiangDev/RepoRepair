### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the Box component throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')` when both `border="between"` and `gap="10px"` are specified. This indicates that somewhere in the code, an attempt is made to access the `match` property of an undefined value, likely during the processing of the `gap` or `border` properties.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error suggests that the `gap` value is not being handled correctly, possibly because it is not being parsed or validated properly before being used in a context where a `match` method is expected. This could be due to a mismatch in how the `gap` value is expected to be formatted or processed compared to how it is actually being provided.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/js/components/Box/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js ---
```
src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js
function: function_40
function: function_41
```
- `function_40`: This function handles the generation of styles based on `directionProp`, `gap`, `responsive`, `border`, and `theme`. It is relevant because it processes the `gap` and `border` properties, which are the source of the issue.
- `function_41`: This function is a conditional styling function that triggers when the `gap` property is provided. It calls `gapStyle` to generate appropriate gap styling, which is also relevant to the problem.

#### --- src/js/components/Box/stories/Border.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/js/utils/border.js ---
```
src/js/utils/border.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```
- `function_1`: This function generates CSS border styles dynamically based on the provided `data` and `theme`. It is relevant because it processes the `border` property, which is part of the issue.
- `function_2`: This function processes border-related data to generate CSS styles for borders. It handles multiple border configurations and applies responsive design if enabled, making it relevant to the problem.

#### --- src/js/utils/mixins.js ---
```
src/js/utils/mixins.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```
- `function_1`: This function parses a metric value, which could be relevant if the `gap` value is not being parsed correctly.
- `function_2`: This function returns a numerical value representing the edge size, which could be relevant if the `gap` value is not being handled correctly as an edge size.
