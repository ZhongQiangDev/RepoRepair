### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the filters overflow in the dropdown menu when there are many filters. The expected behavior is to have a `layer` prop that allows the filters to be displayed in a separate layer, providing more space and preventing overflow.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the overflow issue is likely due to the current implementation of the `DataFilters` component, which only supports a `drop` prop for dropdown menus. The component does not have a `layer` prop that would allow it to display filters in a separate layer. This limitation results in the filters being cramped into the dropdown menu, leading to overflow.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js ---
This file contains the `DataFilters` component, which is directly related to the issue. The component needs to be updated to support a `layer` prop.

```
src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js
function: DataFilters
```

#### --- src/js/components/DataFilters/index.d.ts ---
This file contains the type definitions for the `DataFilters` component. It needs to be updated to include the `layer` prop.

```
src/js/components/DataFilters/index.d.ts
```

#### --- src/js/components/Drop/StyledDrop.js ---
This file contains styled components related to the dropdown menu. While it may not directly cause the issue, it might need to be adjusted if the `layer` prop affects the styling of the dropdown.

```
src/js/components/Drop/StyledDrop.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
function: function_4
function: function_5
function: function_6
function: function_7
function: function_8
```

#### --- src/js/components/Layer/Layer.js ---
This file contains the `Layer` component, which could be used to implement the `layer` prop in the `DataFilters` component. The `Layer` component manages the creation and cleanup of a portal-based container for rendering content outside the parent DOM hierarchy.

```
src/js/components/Layer/Layer.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- src/js/components/Layer/LayerContainer.js ---
This file contains the `LayerContainer` component, which could be used in conjunction with the `Layer` component to implement the `layer` prop. The `LayerContainer` component renders a layer with customizable properties.

```
src/js/components/Layer/LayerContainer.js
function: function_1
```
