### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the background color specified for the checked radio button is being applied to all radio buttons instead of just the one that is checked. This means that when a background color is set for the checked state, all radio buttons in the group display this background color, rather than only the selected one.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the background color is being applied in the styling logic. The background color for the checked state might be applied to all radio buttons instead of being conditionally applied only to the checked one. This could be due to a mistake in the conditional logic that determines which radio button should receive the checked background color.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js`

This file contains the main `RadioButton` component. The issue likely lies in how the checked state is handled and how the background color is applied. The function `function_1` is responsible for rendering the radio button and applying styles based on the checked state.

```
src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js`

This file contains styled components for the radio button. The function `function_13` is responsible for dynamically computing the background color for the radio button's checkmark. This function might be incorrectly applying the background color to all radio buttons instead of just the checked one.

```
src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js
function: function_13
```

#### `src/js/themes/base.js`

This file contains theme configurations. While it defines color values and other theme-related properties, it does not directly handle the conditional application of styles to the radio button. Therefore, it is unlikely to be directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/utils/colors.js`

This file contains utility functions for color manipulation. While these functions are used to normalize and process color values, they do not directly handle the conditional application of styles to the radio button. Therefore, they are not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/utils/styles.js`

This file contains utility functions for styling. While these functions are used to dynamically retrieve and apply styles based on the theme, they do not directly handle the conditional application of styles to the radio button. Therefore, they are not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant files and functions that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
function: function_1

src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js
function: function_13
```
