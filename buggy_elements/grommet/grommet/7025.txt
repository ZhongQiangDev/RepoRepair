### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the 'Clear Filters' button is missing when the user interacts with the Data Toolbar components, such as the Filter and Search components. According to the expected behavior, the 'Clear Filters' button should appear whenever the user interacts with these components.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the 'Clear Filters' button is being rendered or controlled within the Data Toolbar components. It seems that the button is not being promoted to the top-level component as expected, which means it might be missing from the toolbar content or the logic that determines its visibility is not functioning correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/js/components/Data/Data.js ---
This file contains the main Data component, which initializes and manages the view state and toolbar content. The 'Clear Filters' button should be part of the toolbar content, so this file is relevant.

```
src/js/components/Data/Data.js
function: function_3
```

#### --- src/js/components/Data/stories/Controlled.js ---
This file contains a React component that renders a data management interface with a toolbar. It does not directly manage the 'Clear Filters' button, but it uses the Data component, so it might be indirectly relevant.

```
src/js/components/Data/stories/Controlled.js
function: function_5
```

#### --- src/js/components/Data/stories/DataTable.js ---
This file contains a React component that renders a structured layout for displaying tabular data. It does not directly manage the 'Clear Filters' button, so it is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/js/components/Data/stories/Inline.js ---
This file contains a React component that renders a responsive layout for displaying and filtering data. It does not directly manage the 'Clear Filters' button, so it is not relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js ---
This file contains the DataFilters component, which provides a flexible interface for filtering data. The 'Clear Filters' button is likely part of this component, so it is relevant.

```
src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js
function: function_1
```
