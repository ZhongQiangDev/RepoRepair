### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the search input within the `Select` component appears very small in Safari, despite the padding being ignored. This issue does not occur in Chrome, where the search input appears as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how Safari handles the `-webkit-appearance` property on `<input type='search' />` elements. In Safari, the default styling for search inputs includes a specific appearance that may override padding and other styles. The solution mentioned in the problem description involves adding `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` to the search input, which should normalize its appearance across browsers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One
