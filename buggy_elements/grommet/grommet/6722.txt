### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `Name` (e.g., "File log level") and the `value` (e.g., the `Select` component) in the `NameValuePair` are not vertically aligned. The `Name` is positioned higher than the `value`, as indicated by the red and green lines in the provided image.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment likely stems from the styling or layout properties applied to the `NameValuePair` component. Specifically, the `valueProps` and `nameProps` might not be correctly configured to ensure both elements are vertically centered. The `NameValuePair` component might be using default alignment settings that do not align the `Name` and `value` properly.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/js/components/NameValueList/NameValueList.js`

This file contains the `NameValueList` component, which is the parent component of `NameValuePair`. It sets up the grid layout and passes down props like `nameProps`, `valueProps`, and `pairProps` to child components.

```
src/js/components/NameValueList/NameValueList.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValueList/stories/Align.js`

This file demonstrates the alignment capabilities of the `NameValueList` and `NameValuePair` components. It does not directly cause the alignment issue but can be used to test the fix.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValueList/stories/PairProps.js`

This file demonstrates the use of `pairProps` to arrange name-value pairs in a vertical column layout. It does not directly cause the alignment issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValueList/stories/Width.js`

This file demonstrates setting widths for names and values in the `NameValueList`. It does not directly cause the alignment issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/NameValuePair/NameValuePair.js`

This file contains the `NameValuePair` component, which is responsible for rendering the name-value pair. The alignment issue is likely caused by how this component handles the alignment of the `Name` and `value`.

```
src/js/components/NameValuePair/NameValuePair.js
function: function_1
```
