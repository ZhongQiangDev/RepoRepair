### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the circle meter path animation is not smooth when the value changes. Instead, it exhibits a strange animation in Chrome, while there is no animation at all in the latest versions of Firefox and Safari. The animation issue is specifically related to the transition applied to the SVG path of the circle meter.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the strange animation is likely due to the CSS transition applied to the SVG path. The transition is set to `transition: all 300ms`, which affects all properties of the path, including those that should not be animated. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in Chrome, where the browser may handle the transition differently compared to other browsers like Firefox and Safari.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js`

This file contains the `Circle` component, which is responsible for rendering the circular meter. The issue described is related to the animation of the SVG path, which is likely handled within this component.

```
src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js`

This file contains the `Meter` component, which is a higher-level component that can render either a bar or a circular meter based on the `type` parameter. While it does not directly handle the animation, it is responsible for rendering the `Circle` component.

```
src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js
function: function_3
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/meter.stories.js`

This file contains storybook stories for the `Meter` component. It does not directly handle the animation and is not relevant to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js`

This file contains styled-components for the `Meter` component. It defines the `border-radius` and other styles, but it does not handle the animation.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/utils/graphics.js`

This file contains utility functions for generating SVG path commands and converting polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. While these functions are used to generate the SVG path, they do not handle the animation.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
