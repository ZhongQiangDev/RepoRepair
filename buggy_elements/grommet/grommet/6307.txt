### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using browser navigation (back/forward buttons), the URL changes, but the sorting arrow icons in the table headers do not update to reflect the new sorting state stored in the URL. This inconsistency between the URL and the table header state leads to a mismatch in the user interface.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the component responsible for rendering the table headers and sorting icons is not re-rendering or updating its state when the URL changes due to browser navigation. This could be due to a lack of a mechanism to listen for URL changes and update the component's state accordingly. The component may only update its state when the user interacts directly with the table headers, but not when the URL changes via browser navigation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/js/components/DataTable/Body.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js ---
```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` in `DataTable.js` is the main DataTable component. It manages the state for sorting, filtering, and other table functionalities. It likely needs to listen for URL changes and update its internal state accordingly to ensure the sorting icons are consistent with the URL.

#### --- src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js ---
```
src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js
function: function_5
```
The `function_5` in `Header.js` is responsible for rendering the header row of the data table. It handles sorting, filtering, and other header-related functionalities. It needs to ensure that the sorting icons are updated based on the current sorting state, which should be derived from the URL when the component re-renders.

#### --- src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js ---
```
src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `Sorter.js` is responsible for rendering the column headers with sorting functionality. It needs to ensure that the sorting icons are updated based on the current sorting state, which should be derived from the URL when the component re-renders.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
function: function_3
```
2. ```
src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js
function: function_5
```
3. ```
src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js
function: function_1
```

These functions need to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure they listen for URL changes and update the sorting state and icons accordingly.
