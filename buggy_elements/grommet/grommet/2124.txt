### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the Grommet2 Calendar does not display properly in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). The screenshot shows that the calendar is not rendering correctly, with some days missing or improperly displayed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue is likely related to compatibility problems with IE11. Common causes for such issues include:
- **CSS Flexbox Issues**: IE11 has limited support for CSS Flexbox, which might cause layout problems.
- **CSS Grid Issues**: If the calendar uses CSS Grid, it may not render correctly in IE11.
- **JavaScript Polyfills**: Some JavaScript features used in the calendar may not be supported in IE11 without polyfills.
- **Styling Issues**: Specific CSS properties or values may not be supported in IE11.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js`

This file contains the main logic for the Calendar component. The following functions may be relevant:

```
src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js
function: function_13
```

`function_13` is the main React component that renders the calendar. It manages date selection, range selection, and month navigation. If there are layout issues, they might be related to how this function renders the calendar.

#### `src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js`

This file contains styled-components for the calendar. The following functions may be relevant:

```
src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js
function: function_1
function: function_14
function: function_16
function: function_17
function: function_18
```

These functions define the styles for various parts of the calendar, including size, fill, and conditional styles. If there are CSS-related issues, they might be found here.

#### `src/js/components/Calendar/utils.js`

This file contains utility functions for date manipulation. While these functions are important for the calendar's functionality, they are less likely to cause display issues directly:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/themes/vanilla.js`

This file contains theme-related functions. While theme settings can affect the appearance, they are less likely to cause specific display issues in IE11:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/utils/styles.js`

This file contains utility functions for styles. The following functions may be relevant:

```
src/js/utils/styles.js
function: function_1
function: function_13
function: function_16
function: function_18
```

These functions handle dynamic styling based on theme properties. If there are issues with how styles are applied, they might be found here.

### Summary

The most likely locations for the issue are in `src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js` and `src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js`, where the main rendering logic and styles are defined. The functions listed above should be inspected for compatibility issues with IE11.
