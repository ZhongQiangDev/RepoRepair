### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `Meter` component with `type="circle"` is not rendering all the data points as expected. Instead, it only renders the last data point, which is not the intended functionality. This issue started occurring in version `v2.25.0` and was working correctly in `v2.24.0`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in how the `Circle` component processes and renders the `values` array. Specifically, the problem could be related to how the start and end angles for each segment are calculated or how the segments are being drawn in the SVG path. The issue might also be related to how the `deriveMax` function calculates the maximum value for the meter, which could affect the proportion of each segment.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js`

This file contains the `Circle` component, which is directly responsible for rendering the circular meter. The issue is likely located here.

```
src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js`

This file contains the `Meter` component, which is the parent component that renders either a bar or a circular chart based on the `type` parameter. The `deriveMax` function is used to calculate the maximum value for the chart, which could be related to the issue.

```
src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js
function: function_1
function: function_3
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/utils.js`

This file contains utility functions that might be used by the `Circle` component, such as `strokeProps` for determining stroke properties and `function_2` for determining colors. These functions might indirectly affect the rendering of the segments.

```
src/js/components/Meter/utils.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/stories/Circle.js`

This file contains a story for the `Circle` component, which is not directly related to the issue but could be useful for testing.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/js/components/Meter/stories/VerticalBarMultiple.js`

This file contains a story for a vertical bar meter, which is not directly related to the issue.
