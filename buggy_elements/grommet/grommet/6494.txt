### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `RangeInput` within the `FormField` is not centered and extends beyond the edge of the `FormField`. This misalignment causes the `RangeInput` to appear off-center and visually incorrect.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from incorrect styling or layout properties applied to the `RangeInput` or `FormField`. Specifically, the padding, margin, or width properties might not be correctly set, causing the `RangeInput` to overflow its container. Additionally, the alignment properties (e.g., `justify-content`, `align-items`) might not be correctly configured to center the `RangeInput` within the `FormField`.
