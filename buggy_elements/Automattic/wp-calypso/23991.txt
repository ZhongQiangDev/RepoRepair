### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user sets and then removes a featured image on a new post, and subsequently tries to navigate away from the page using the back button, an "Are You Sure?" (AYS) dialog appears. This dialog indicates that the system believes there are unsaved changes, even though the post content has not actually changed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the system marking the post as "dirty" (indicating unsaved changes) when the featured image is set and then removed. This could be due to the featured image setting/removal process not properly resetting the post's dirty state, leading the system to believe changes are pending even when they are not.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx ---
```
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx
class: EditorFeaturedImage
```
The `EditorFeaturedImage` class is responsible for handling the featured image functionality. The methods `setImage` and `removeImage` likely interact with the post's state and may need to ensure the post is not marked as dirty unnecessarily.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/preview-container.jsx ---
```
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/preview-container.jsx
function: function_7
```
The `function_7` method updates the featured image and might be involved in marking the post as dirty. It should ensure that the post's dirty state is correctly managed.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-ground-control/quick-save-buttons.jsx ---
```
client/post-editor/editor-ground-control/quick-save-buttons.jsx
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` (isSaveAvailableFn) checks if the post has unsaved changes (`isDirty`). If the featured image setting/removal incorrectly marks the post as dirty, this function will return `true`, leading to the AYS dialog.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-title/index.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `EditorTitle` class and related functions handle the post title and do not seem directly related to the featured image functionality.
