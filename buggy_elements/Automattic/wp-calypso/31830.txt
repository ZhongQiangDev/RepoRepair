### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the app banner is still being displayed within the mobile app when navigating to the "Stats" section of a site. The user expects to see their website without the app banner since they are already using the mobile app.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the logic that determines whether the app banner should be displayed. The `AppBanner` class has a method `isVisible()` which checks if the banner should be displayed based on the device type and dismissal status. However, it seems that this logic does not account for the fact that the user is already within the mobile app, leading to the banner being shown unnecessarily.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `AppBanner` class, which is directly responsible for rendering the app banner. The `isVisible()` method in this class needs to be examined to ensure it correctly identifies when the user is within the mobile app and prevents the banner from being displayed.

```
client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
class: AppBanner
```

#### --- client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js ---
This file contains utility functions that may be used by the `AppBanner` class. The `isDismissed` function checks if the banner has been dismissed for a specific section, but it does not directly control whether the banner is displayed within the app. The `getCurrentSection` function determines the current section, which may be relevant for the `isVisible()` logic.

```
client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js
function: getCurrentSection
```

#### --- client/state/selectors/is-directly-uninitialized.js ---
This file contains a function that checks if a specific section is uninitialized. This is not directly related to the app banner display logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/state/selectors/is-notifications-open.js ---
This file contains a function that checks if the notifications panel is open. This is not directly related to the app banner display logic.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/state/selectors/is-requesting-site-monitor-settings.js ---
This file contains a function that checks if a request for site monitor settings is in progress. This is not directly related to the app banner display logic.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
