### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the prop `showEmailSettings` should be renamed to `showNotificationSettings` to reflect the fact that the popover now deals with both new post notifications and email notification settings. Additionally, the test case specifies that recommended sites under the search box should not have a 'Settings' link, even if the user is following one of them.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is likely due to the outdated naming of the prop `showEmailSettings`, which does not accurately reflect the current functionality of the popover. The renaming is necessary to ensure that the codebase accurately represents the current functionality and to avoid confusion for developers and users. The test case also suggests that there might be an issue with the visibility of the 'Settings' link for recommended sites, which could be related to how the component handles the display of settings options.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/blocks/reader-email-settings/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `ReaderEmailSettings` class and the `mapStateToProps` function. The class and function are related to email settings, but since the issue involves renaming `showEmailSettings` to `showNotificationSettings`, this file is relevant.

```
client/blocks/reader-email-settings/index.jsx
function: mapStateToProps
class: ReaderEmailSettings
```

#### --- client/blocks/reader-site-notification-settings/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `ReaderSiteNotificationSettings` class and the `mapStateToProps` function. The class and function are related to notification settings, which aligns with the new name `showNotificationSettings`. This file is relevant.

```
client/blocks/reader-site-notification-settings/index.jsx
function: mapStateToProps
class: ReaderSiteNotificationSettings
```

#### --- client/reader/following-manage/empty.jsx ---
This file contains the `FollowingManageEmptyContent` class, which is related to the empty state UI for the "Manage Following" section. This file does not seem directly related to the renaming of the prop or the visibility of the 'Settings' link for recommended sites.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- client/reader/following-manage/index.jsx ---
This file contains the `FollowingManage` class and the `function_1` function. The `FollowingManage` class manages the list of sites the user is following and handles search functionality. The `function_1` function maps the Redux state and props to the `FollowingManage` component. This file is relevant because it might contain logic related to the visibility of the 'Settings' link for recommended sites.

```
client/reader/following-manage/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: FollowingManage
```

#### --- client/reader/following-manage/search-followed.jsx ---
This file contains the `FollowingManageSearchFollowed` class, which is related to the search input field for filtering followed sites. This file does not seem directly related to the renaming of the prop or the visibility of the 'Settings' link for recommended sites.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
