### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the upgrade nudge is visible on the media page for users with editor and author roles, even though these roles cannot upgrade the site. The upgrade nudge should only be visible to users who have the capability to upgrade the site, such as administrators.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the lack of a role-based check in the code that renders the upgrade nudge. The code responsible for displaying the upgrade nudge does not currently verify the user's role or capability to upgrade the site before rendering the nudge. As a result, the nudge is displayed to all users, regardless of their role.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/blocks/plan-storage/bar.jsx`

This file contains the `PlanStorageBar` class, which is responsible for rendering the storage bar and the upgrade nudge. To fix the issue, we need to add a check to ensure that the upgrade nudge is only displayed to users who have the capability to upgrade the site.

```
client/blocks/plan-storage/bar.jsx
class: PlanStorageBar
```

#### `client/components/data/query-site-roles/index.jsx`

This file contains the `QuerySiteRoles` class and the `function_1` function, which are related to requesting and checking site roles. While these functions are relevant to user roles, they do not directly control the visibility of the upgrade nudge. However, the `QuerySiteRoles` class could be used to fetch the user's role, which can then be used in the `PlanStorageBar` class to determine if the upgrade nudge should be displayed.

```
client/components/data/query-site-roles/index.jsx
class: QuerySiteRoles
```

#### `client/state/selectors/can-current-user.js`

This file contains the `canCurrentUser` function, which checks if the current user has a specific capability for a given site. This function can be used to determine if the user has the capability to upgrade the site, which is necessary for deciding whether to display the upgrade nudge.

```
client/state/selectors/can-current-user.js
function: canCurrentUser
```

#### `client/state/selectors/is-eligible-for-domain-to-paid-plan-upsell.js`

This file contains the `isEligibleForDomainToPaidPlanUpsell` function, which checks if the user is eligible for a domain to paid plan upsell. While this function is related to upsell eligibility, it is not directly relevant to the issue of hiding the upgrade nudge for editor and author roles.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/state/selectors/is-eligible-for-free-to-paid-upsell.js`

This file contains the `isEligibleForFreeToPaidUpsell` function, which checks if the user is eligible for a free to paid plan upsell. Similar to the previous file, this function is related to upsell eligibility but not directly relevant to the issue at hand.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
