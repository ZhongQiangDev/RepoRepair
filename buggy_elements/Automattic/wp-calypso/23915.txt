### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the "Edit" link is clicked on a post in the Reader for Jetpack sites, the page enters a weird state where the top and side bars disappear, but the reader content is still displayed, and the user does not fully enter the "edit" mode.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a problem with the URL generated for the "Edit" link or the way the application handles the transition to the edit mode. The `getEditURL` function in `client/blocks/post-edit-button/index.jsx` might be generating an incorrect URL, or there could be an issue with how the application processes this URL when clicked. Additionally, the `PostItem` class in `client/blocks/post-item/index.jsx` might not be correctly handling the user's ability to edit the post.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/blocks/post-edit-button/index.jsx`
```
client/blocks/post-edit-button/index.jsx
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function generates the URL for the "Edit" link. If this URL is incorrect, it could lead to the described issue.

#### `client/blocks/post-item/index.jsx`
```
client/blocks/post-item/index.jsx
function: function_2
class: PostItem
```
The `function_2` function determines whether the user can edit the post and generates the appropriate URL. The `PostItem` class manages the rendering and interaction of the post item, including the "Edit" link.

#### `client/components/reader-main/index.jsx`
```
client/components/reader-main/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: ReaderMain
```
The `function_1` function controls the presence of the 'is-reader-page' class on the body element, which could affect the layout and styling of the page. The `ReaderMain` class manages the state of the Reader page, which might be relevant if the page state is not being updated correctly when entering edit mode.

#### `client/components/tinymce/index.jsx`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to the TinyMCE editor and does not seem directly relevant to the issue described.

#### `client/blocks/reader-excerpt/index.jsx`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to rendering the excerpt of a post and does not seem directly relevant to the issue described.
