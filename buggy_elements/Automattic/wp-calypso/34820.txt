### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that selecting the "Online Store" option during the signup process results in a blank screen instead of navigating to the Domain Search page. The user expects to be taken to the next step in the signup process, but instead, they encounter a blank screen.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

Based on the error messages captured in the screenshots, the issue appears to be related to authentication. The error messages indicate that the system is unable to fetch the user from the `/me` endpoint due to an `AuthorizationRequiredError`. This suggests that the application is unable to obtain an active access token, which is necessary to query information about the current user. This could be due to several reasons, such as:

- The OAuth token is not being set correctly.
- There is an issue with the token validation process.
- The user is not being redirected properly after authentication.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `client/auth/connect.jsx`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `client/auth/controller.js`

```
client/auth/controller.js
function: function_2
function: function_4
function: function_5
```

- `function_2`: This function checks if the current path requires an OAuth token and redirects the user if necessary. It could be relevant if there is an issue with the token validation process.
- `function_4`: This function handles the OAuth authentication process for an API. It sets up the OAuth settings and generates an authentication URL. It could be relevant if there is an issue with the OAuth token setup.
- `function_5`: This function retrieves and stores the access token and redirects the user after authentication. It could be relevant if there is an issue with the token retrieval or user redirection.

#### `client/signup/controller.js`

```
client/signup/controller.js
function: redirectToFlow
function: start
```

- `redirectToFlow`: This function manages the redirection logic for the signup process. It could be relevant if there is an issue with the redirection to the Domain Search page.
- `start`: This function prepares the signup process and renders the `SignupComponent`. It could be relevant if there is an issue with the rendering of the signup component.

### Summary

The following locations need inspection or editing to fix the problem:

```
client/auth/controller.js
function: function_2
function: function_4
function: function_5

client/signup/controller.js
function: redirectToFlow
function: start
```
