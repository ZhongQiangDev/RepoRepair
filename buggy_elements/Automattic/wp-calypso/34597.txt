### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors identified in the `GitHub Problem Description` are:

- **Issue 1:** Non-administrator users see upgrade nudges and sections they shouldn't, such as "Ads Earnings" and "Ads Settings."
- **Issue 2:** After deleting all items from the cart, non-administrator users gain access to sections they shouldn't have access to.
- **Issue 3:** When attempting to purchase something, non-administrator users encounter a broken flow and an error message indicating that only administrators can make purchases.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The causes behind these behaviors are likely:

- **Issue 1:** The application does not properly check user roles and permissions before displaying certain sections or upgrade nudges.
- **Issue 2:** There is a lack of proper authorization checks after the cart is emptied, allowing non-administrators to access restricted sections.
- **Issue 3:** The checkout process does not validate user roles, leading to a broken flow and error messages when non-administrators attempt to make purchases.
