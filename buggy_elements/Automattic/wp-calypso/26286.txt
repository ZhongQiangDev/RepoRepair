### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the app banner related to Stats is being shown when visiting the `/stats/activity/YOURSITESLUG` page on a mobile device. This is incorrect because the banner should only be shown for the `/stats` path, not for the `/activity` path.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the `AppBanner` component is currently only checking if the current path is `/stats` to determine whether to display the banner. It does not have any logic to differentiate between `/stats` and `/stats/activity`. As a result, the banner is incorrectly displayed on the `/stats/activity` page.
