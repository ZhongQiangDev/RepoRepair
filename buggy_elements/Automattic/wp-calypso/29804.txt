### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the text displayed on the "checkout thank you" page for users who upgrade to the WordPress.com Premium plan. Specifically:

- The text mentions "No ads or limits," which is misleading because there is a storage limit for the Premium plan.
- The text states that the Premium plan "adds 10GB of file storage," which can be confusing for users upgrading from the Personal plan, as they already have 6GB of storage.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the text being generated or hardcoded in a way that does not account for the specific storage limits and upgrades for different plan types. The text needs to be updated to reflect the correct storage limits and avoid any misleading statements about "no limits."

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/blocks/product-purchase-features-list/video-audio-posts.jsx`

This file contains the `VideoAudioPosts` function, which renders the description for the video and audio posts feature. The `getDescription` function within it determines the description text based on the plan type. This function is relevant because it generates the text that needs to be updated.

```
client/blocks/product-purchase-features-list/video-audio-posts.jsx
function: getDescription
```

#### `client/my-sites/checkout/checkout-thank-you/features-header.jsx`

This file contains the `FeaturesHeader` function, which renders the header for the features section on the checkout thank you page. However, it does not directly control the text of the video and audio posts feature description. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/my-sites/checkout/checkout-thank-you/premium-plan-details.jsx`

This file contains the `PremiumPlanDetails` function, which renders various features of the premium plan. It includes the `PurchaseDetail` components that display different features, including video and audio posts. This function is relevant because it may be responsible for rendering the text that needs to be updated.

```
client/my-sites/checkout/checkout-thank-you/premium-plan-details.jsx
function: function_1
```

#### `client/my-sites/plan-compare-card/docs/example.jsx`

This file contains a `render` function that generates a "Free Plan" card. It is not relevant to the issue because it does not deal with the Premium plan or the text on the checkout thank you page.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/state/selectors/get-media-storage-limit.js`

This file contains the `getMediaStorageLimit` function, which retrieves the media storage limit for a site. While it is related to storage limits, it does not directly control the text on the checkout thank you page. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
