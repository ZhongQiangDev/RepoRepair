### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after trashing a post, the user is unexpectedly prompted with a restore dialog instead of seeing a success message or being redirected away from the editor. This indicates that the post trashing process is not completing as expected, and the system is reverting to a state where it expects the post to be restored.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in the post trashing process not being properly completed or acknowledged by the system. This could be due to several reasons:
- The trashing action might not be successfully updating the post status in the backend.
- The frontend might not be correctly handling the response from the backend after the trashing action.
- There might be an issue with the state management where the post is still considered as "not trashed" even after the trashing action.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-delete-post/index.jsx ---
```
client/post-editor/editor-delete-post/index.jsx
class: EditorDeletePost
```
This file contains the `EditorDeletePost` class, which is responsible for handling the trashing of posts. The `sendToTrash` method is likely where the trashing action is initiated. If this method does not correctly update the post status or handle the response, it could lead to the described issue.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-revisions/dialog.jsx ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to post revisions and does not seem directly relevant to the trashing process.

#### --- client/state/posts/actions.js ---
```
client/state/posts/actions.js
function: trashPost
function: deletePost
function: restorePost
```
This file contains several functions related to post actions, including `trashPost`, `deletePost`, and `restorePost`. The `trashPost` function is directly related to the trashing process and should be examined to ensure it correctly updates the post status and handles the response.

#### --- client/state/posts/reducer.js ---
```
client/state/posts/reducer.js
function: function_3
function: function_7
```
This file contains reducers that manage the state of posts. The `function_3` and `function_7` functions handle actions related to deleting and updating posts. These functions should be checked to ensure they correctly update the state when a post is trashed.

#### --- client/state/ui/editor/reducer.js ---
```
client/state/ui/editor/reducer.js
function: postId
```
This file contains a reducer that manages the editor's post ID. The `postId` function should be examined to ensure it correctly handles the post ID when a post is trashed and prevents the restore dialog from appearing incorrectly.
