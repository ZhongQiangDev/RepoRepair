### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user selects a featured image from their Google library and publishes the post, the featured image does not appear in the post preview. Additionally, when trying to close the recently published post, a message appears indicating unsaved changes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a failure in the process of setting the featured image from the Google library. This could be due to:

- The image selection from the Google library not being properly processed or stored.
- The featured image not being correctly associated with the post in the state or database.
- The UI not updating to reflect the newly set featured image.
- The state management not recognizing the image as saved, leading to the "unsaved changes" warning.
