### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the view counts for blog posts are not being displayed in the Blog Posts list. The "Before" image shows that the view counts are missing, while the "After" image shows that the view counts should be present.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the way the view counts are fetched and displayed in the Blog Posts list. The view counts may not be being fetched correctly from the backend, or the frontend may not be rendering them properly. Additionally, there may be performance constraints that need to be addressed to ensure that the view counts can be displayed without impacting the performance of the application.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- client/components/data/query-post-stats/index.jsx ---
```
client/components/data/query-post-stats/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: QueryPostStats
```
The `function_1` and `QueryPostStats` class are relevant because they handle the fetching and refreshing of post statistics, including view counts. The `function_1` checks if a request for post statistics is in progress, and the `QueryPostStats` class manages the fetching and periodic refreshing of post statistics.

#### --- client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-action-counts/index.jsx ---
```
client/my-sites/post-type-list/post-action-counts/index.jsx
function: function_1
class: PostActionCounts
```
The `function_1` and `PostActionCounts` class are relevant because they determine whether to show view counts and render the view count if it should be displayed. The `function_1` checks if the current user has the permission to view stats and if the site is not a Jetpack site or if the Jetpack stats module is active. The `PostActionCounts` class renders the view count if the `showViews` flag is true.

#### --- client/my-sites/posts/post-total-views.jsx ---
```
client/my-sites/posts/post-total-views.jsx
function: function_2
function: PostTotalViews
```
The `function_2` and `PostTotalViews` function are relevant because they display the total number of views for a specific post. The `function_2` connects the `PostTotalViews` component to the Redux store and localizes it, and the `PostTotalViews` function renders the formatted view count.

#### --- client/state/stats/posts/reducer.js ---
```
client/state/stats/posts/reducer.js
function: items
function: requesting
```
The `items` and `requesting` functions are relevant because they manage the state updates for post statistics and the state of requests for post statistics. The `items` function handles the `POST_STATS_RECEIVE` action to update the post statistics, and the `requesting` function manages the state of requests for post statistics.

#### --- client/state/stats/posts/selectors.js ---
```
client/state/stats/posts/selectors.js
function: getPostStat
function: getPostStats
function: isRequestingPostStats
```
The `getPostStat`, `getPostStats`, and `isRequestingPostStats` functions are relevant because they fetch specific stat values and statistics for posts from the global state tree and check if a request for post statistics is currently in progress. The `getPostStat` function fetches a specific stat value, the `getPostStats` function fetches the statistics of a specific post, and the `isRequestingPostStats` function checks if a request for post statistics is in progress.
