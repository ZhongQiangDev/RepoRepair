### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that currently, only the Administrator who purchased a plan can manage it. There is no functionality to transfer ownership of a purchased plan to another Administrator on the site. The proposal is to allow customers to transfer ownership of a purchased plan to any other Administrator on their site.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the lack of a feature or functionality in the existing codebase that allows for the transfer of plan ownership. The current implementation only associates the plan with the Administrator who purchased it and does not provide a mechanism for transferring ownership to another user.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- client/my-sites/plans/controller.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/my-sites/plans/current-plan/controller.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/my-sites/plans-features-main/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/state/plans/selectors.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/state/sites/plans/selectors.js ---
```
client/state/sites/plans/selectors.js
function: isCurrentUserCurrentPlanOwner
```

The `isCurrentUserCurrentPlanOwner` function checks if the current user is the owner of the current plan. This function is relevant because it determines the ownership of the plan, which is a key aspect of the proposed feature to transfer ownership.
