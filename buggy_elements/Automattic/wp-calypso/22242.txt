### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a user enters a URL with `/wp-admin` appended (e.g., `https://example.com/wp-admin`), Jetpack Connect does not correctly handle this URL. Instead of recognizing that Jetpack is already installed and activated on the site, it prompts the user to install Jetpack again. After clicking "Install Jetpack," the user is redirected to a URL with a double `/wp-admin` (e.g., `/wp-admin/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?...`), resulting in a 404 error.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how Jetpack Connect processes and validates the URL entered by the user. Specifically, it seems that the URL validation and normalization logic does not properly handle URLs with `/wp-admin` appended. This results in Jetpack Connect incorrectly determining that Jetpack is not installed on the site, leading to the prompt to install Jetpack again. Additionally, the redirection logic may not be correctly handling the URL structure, resulting in the double `/wp-admin` in the final URL.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- client/jetpack-connect/main.jsx ---
```
client/jetpack-connect/main.jsx
function: function_1
class: JetpackConnectMain
```
- `function_1` is involved in retrieving Jetpack site data by URL, which is relevant to the URL handling issue.
- `JetpackConnectMain` manages the Jetpack connection process, including URL validation and site status checks.

#### --- client/jetpack-connect/site-url-input.jsx ---
```
client/jetpack-connect/site-url-input.jsx
class: JetpackConnectSiteUrlInput
```
- `JetpackConnectSiteUrlInput` handles the input field for the site URL and includes methods for validating and checking the URL, which is directly related to the issue.

#### --- client/state/jetpack/settings/actions.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- This file deals with fetching and updating Jetpack settings, which is not directly related to URL handling or validation.

#### --- client/state/sites/selectors.js ---
```
client/state/sites/selectors.js
function: getSiteByUrl
function: getJetpackSiteRemoteManagementUrl
function: getSiteAdminUrl
```
- `getSiteByUrl` retrieves a site by URL, which is relevant to the URL handling issue.
- `getJetpackSiteRemoteManagementUrl` constructs the remote management URL, which may be involved in the redirection logic.
- `getSiteAdminUrl` retrieves the admin URL for a site, which could be relevant to the double `/wp-admin` issue.
