### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the current implementation does not display a success screen after the user has inserted a contact form and connected successfully. Instead, it continues to display the contact form tile. Additionally, the actual insertion of the contact form should happen only after the user has connected, which is not currently the case.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the logic that determines what screen to display based on the user's progress in the onboarding process. Specifically, the application needs to check if the user has inserted a contact form and connected successfully before showing the success screen. If these conditions are not met, the application should either show the contact form tile or lead the user to the Jetpack Connect (JPC) flow.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `client/components/tinymce/plugins/contact-form/plugin.jsx`

This file contains the logic for integrating the contact form into the TinyMCE editor. It does not directly handle the onboarding process or the success screen display. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/components/tinymce/plugins/wpcom-view/views/contact-form/index.jsx`

This file contains functions related to editing and rendering the contact form within the editor. It does not handle the onboarding process or the success screen display. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/jetpack-onboarding/index.js`

This file sets up the routing for the Jetpack onboarding process. It defines the route for the onboarding steps but does not handle the logic for displaying the success screen or checking the user's progress. Therefore:

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/contact-form.jsx`

This file contains the `JetpackOnboardingContactFormStep` class, which is responsible for rendering the contact form step in the onboarding process. This class likely needs to be updated to include the logic for displaying the success screen and checking the user's progress.

```
client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/contact-form.jsx
class: JetpackOnboardingContactFormStep
```

#### `client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js`

This file contains action creators for managing the Jetpack onboarding settings and credentials. These actions may be relevant for updating the state to reflect whether the user has inserted a contact form and connected successfully.

```
client/state/jetpack-onboarding/actions.js
function: function_3
function: function_4
function: function_5
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
