### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the "From Name" field is cleared in the email settings of a site with an encodable character in its Site Title (e.g., "Allendav's Store Test"), an undecoded HTML entity (`&#039;`) appears in the "From Name" field instead of the expected decoded character (`'`).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the failure to properly decode HTML entities when the "From Name" field is populated with the site title. The site title contains an encoded character (`&#039;`), which should be decoded to `'` before being displayed in the "From Name" field. This suggests that the function responsible for setting the "From Name" field is not correctly decoding HTML entities.

function: decodeEntities
```
