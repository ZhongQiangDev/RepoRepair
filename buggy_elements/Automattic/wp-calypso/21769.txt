### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user deletes their primary site and then tries to access the contact form via the help button, the contact form fails to load. Instead, the user sees a blank page with the message "Loading contact form" repeatedly, and the console shows errors indicating that a property 'ID' of null cannot be read. This suggests that the application is attempting to access a property of an object that is null, likely due to the absence of a primary site.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely related to the application's inability to handle the scenario where no primary site exists. The error message "Cannot read property 'ID' of null" suggests that the application is trying to access the 'ID' property of an object that is null, which is probably the primary site object. This indicates that the application does not have a fallback mechanism in place when there is no primary site selected.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `client/state/selectors/get-primary-site-id.js`

This file contains the `getPrimarySiteId` function, which retrieves the primary site ID from the global state. If no primary site exists, this function returns `null`. This function is relevant because it is likely the source of the `null` value that causes the error.

```
client/state/selectors/get-primary-site-id.js
function: getPrimarySiteId
```

#### `client/state/selectors/get-selected-or-primary-site-id.js`

This file contains the `getSelectedOrPrimarySiteId` function, which attempts to retrieve the selected site ID and falls back to the primary site ID if no site is selected. If both the selected site and primary site are not available, this function will return `null`. This function is relevant because it is likely used to determine the site ID for the contact form.

```
client/state/selectors/get-selected-or-primary-site-id.js
function: getSelectedOrPrimarySiteId
```

#### `client/support/support-user/login-dialog.jsx`

This file contains the `SupportUserLoginDialog` class, which is a React component for the support user login dialog. This class does not seem directly related to the issue of loading the contact form when no primary site exists. The issue appears to be more related to site selection and primary site handling rather than user login.
