### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that during the blog signup flow, there is a flash of an account details screen with a notice stating, "Your account has already been created. You can change your email, username, and password later." This screen should not appear, and the flow should automatically progress to the logged-in checklist view for the free plan or to checkout if a paid plan is selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely involves the flow management and progress tracking within the signup process. Specifically, the flow is not correctly skipping or hiding the account details screen when it should automatically progress to the next step. This could be due to incorrect state management, improper handling of flow steps, or a misconfiguration in the flow progress logic.
