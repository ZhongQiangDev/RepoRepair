### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `localForage` library, which is used by WordPress.com/Calypso and Gutenberg, has an Apache 2.0 license. This license is incompatible with the GPLv2 license used by WordPress.com and Gutenberg. As a result, the `npm install` command fails with an error indicating that `localForage` has an incompatible license.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the license incompatibility between `localForage` (Apache 2.0) and the projects using it (GPLv2). The `npm run check-licenses` script is designed to ensure that all dependencies have compatible licenses. Since `localForage` does not meet this requirement, the script fails, preventing the installation from completing successfully.

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the license compatibility issue with `localForage`. The issue is more related to the project's dependency management and licensing policies rather than the specific functionality of these files. To resolve the issue, the maintainers of `localForage` could consider relicensing it under a GPL-compatible license, or the projects using `localForage` could find an alternative library with a compatible license.
