### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a non-admin user (subscriber) connects their site using Jetpack, they are redirected to `/jetpack/connect/plans`, but instead of seeing the plans page, they see the JPC initial site entry screen. This indicates that the redirection logic or the page rendering logic is not correctly handling the user's role or the connection status.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from a few potential areas:
- **Incorrect Redirection Logic**: The application might not be correctly identifying the user's role and redirecting them appropriately after the connection process.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: The application might not be properly checking the user's role (subscriber vs. admin) and rendering the correct page based on their permissions.
- **State Management**: The state management system might not be correctly updating or reflecting the user's connection status and role, leading to the wrong page being rendered.
