### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that products cannot be added to the store if the category name contains an "&" symbol. When attempting to save a product with such a category, an error message "There was a problem saving. Please try again" is displayed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the "&" symbol is being handled in the category name. This symbol might be causing encoding or parsing issues when the category data is being processed or sent to the server. The problem could be related to how the category name is being sanitized, encoded, or decoded during the creation or update process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/extensions/woocommerce/app/product-categories/create.js`

This file contains functions and a class related to creating product categories. The `createProductCategory` action creator is likely involved in the process of creating a new category, which could be where the issue lies if the category name with "&" is not being handled correctly.

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/product-categories/create.js
function: createProductCategory
class: ProductCategoryCreate
```

#### `client/extensions/woocommerce/app/product-categories/form.js`

This file contains the `ProductCategoryForm` class, which handles the form for editing product categories. This class might be involved in the issue if it does not properly handle the "&" symbol in the category name.

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/product-categories/form.js
class: ProductCategoryForm
```

#### `client/extensions/woocommerce/app/products/product-form-categories-card.js`

This file contains the `ProductFormCategoriesCard` function, which manages product categories and featured status. This function might be involved if it does not handle the "&" symbol correctly when updating product categories.

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/app/products/product-form-categories-card.js
function: function_1
```

#### `client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/product-categories/actions.js`

This file contains several action creators related to product categories. The `createProductCategory` and `updateProductCategory` functions are likely involved in the issue if they do not handle the "&" symbol correctly.

```
client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/product-categories/actions.js
function: createProductCategory
function: updateProductCategory
```

#### `client/extensions/woocommerce/state/sites/product-categories/reducer.js`

This file contains reducers that manage the state of product categories. While these reducers are responsible for updating the state based on actions, they are less likely to be directly involved in the issue unless they are mishandling the "&" symbol in the category name.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
