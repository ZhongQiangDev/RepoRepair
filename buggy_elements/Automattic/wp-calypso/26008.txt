### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that embedded Crowdsignal surveys are not being displayed in the Reader. Instead of showing the survey, the post appears empty or does not display any representation of the survey. This issue is similar to the problem with Polldaddy embeds not being displayed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the lack of a specific rule or function to detect and properly render Crowdsignal surveys within the post content. The current implementation only has a rule to detect Polldaddy polls, as mentioned in the problem description. Since Crowdsignal surveys embed differently, a similar rule needs to be implemented to handle these surveys.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### client/blocks/reader-full-post/header.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### client/blocks/reader-full-post/unavailable.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-media.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-polls.js
```
client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-polls.js
function: detectPolls
```

The `detectPolls` function is relevant because it handles the detection and transformation of Polldaddy poll embeds. A similar function needs to be created for Crowdsignal surveys.

#### client/reader/embed-helper.jsx
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-polls.js
function: detectPolls
```

To fix the problem, a new function similar to `detectPolls` should be created to detect and properly render Crowdsignal surveys. This function should be added to the `client/lib/post-normalizer` directory, and it should be integrated into the post normalization process to ensure that Crowdsignal surveys are correctly displayed in the Reader.
