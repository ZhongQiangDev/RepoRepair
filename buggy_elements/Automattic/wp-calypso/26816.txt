### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description outlines the following issues and tasks related to the modal for trying the new editor:

- The modal should remember the user's dismissal preference and default to visible on load.
- The modal should redirect to wp-admin for Jetpack/AT sites.
- Click tracking events should be added to both buttons in the dialog.
- The sidebar image should be made clickable.
- The modal should be displayed again when the "Learn More" button is clicked.
- There is a bonus design question about adding an option to not show the modal again for a while.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The wrong behavior stems from the lack of implementation for the follow-up tasks mentioned in the GitHub problem description. Specifically:

- There is no mechanism to remember the user's dismissal preference and default the modal to visible on load.
- The redirection to wp-admin for Jetpack/AT sites is not implemented.
- Click tracking events are not added to the buttons in the dialog.
- The sidebar image is not clickable.
- The modal does not display again when the "Learn More" button is clicked.
- There is no option to not show the modal again for a while.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions or Classes

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-confirmation-sidebar/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-forbidden/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-sidebar/header.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-term-selector/index.jsx ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- client/post-editor/editor-modal/index.jsx ---
```
client/post-editor/editor-modal/index.jsx
class: EditorModal
function: function_1
```

The `EditorModal` class and `function_1` are likely relevant because they may handle the modal's behavior, including displaying the modal, handling user preferences, and adding click tracking events. The `EditorModal` class could manage the modal's visibility and user preferences, while `function_1` could be responsible for extracting necessary data from the state and setting up the modal's behavior.
