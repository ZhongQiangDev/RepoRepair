### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem description outlines the need to introduce a new step in the Jetpack Onboarding process that allows users to enable the Stats module. The wrong behavior involves ensuring that the new step integrates seamlessly with the existing onboarding flow, particularly in terms of navigation and user experience. Specifically:

- The introduction screen should correctly lead to the Jetpack Connect (JPC) flow if the user hasn't connected yet.
- The JPC flow should preserve the Jetpack Onboarding (JPO) wizard navigation back/skip links.
- After connecting or enabling the Stats module, the user should be presented with a success screen with a CTA leading to the next step.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior likely stems from the following:

- The new Stats step needs to be properly integrated into the onboarding flow, ensuring that it correctly handles the transition to the JPC flow if necessary.
- The navigation links (back/skip) need to be preserved during the JPC flow to maintain the user's place in the onboarding process.
- The success screen and its CTA need to be correctly implemented to ensure the user can proceed to the next step.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/components/wizard/navigation-link.jsx`
```
client/components/wizard/navigation-link.jsx
class: NavigationLink
```
This file contains the `NavigationLink` class, which is responsible for rendering navigation buttons in the wizard. It is relevant because it will be used to ensure that the back/skip links are preserved during the JPC flow.

#### `client/jetpack-connect/controller.js`
```
client/jetpack-connect/controller.js
function: authorizeForm
function: connect
function: maybeOnboard
```
This file contains functions that manage the Jetpack Connect flow. The `authorizeForm`, `connect`, and `maybeOnboard` functions are relevant because they handle the authorization and connection processes, which need to be integrated with the new Stats step.

#### `client/jetpack-onboarding/controller.js`
```
client/jetpack-onboarding/controller.js
function: function_2
```
This file contains the `onboarding` function, which manages the onboarding process. It is relevant because it will need to be updated to include the new Stats step and ensure that the navigation and flow are correctly handled.
