### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that after successfully creating a Stripe Connect account, the application does not display a green success banner to inform the user that the Stripe account has been connected successfully. The banner should look similar to the one shown in the image provided.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a mechanism or function that triggers the display of the success banner after the Stripe Connect account creation process is completed successfully. This could be due to missing code that handles the success state and renders the appropriate UI component to show the banner.

### Explanation of Relevant Functions/Classes

- **`mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` in `payment-method-stripe-connected-dialog.js`**: These functions are responsible for connecting the component to the Redux store. They may need to be updated to include the success state and pass it as a prop to the `PaymentMethodStripeConnectedDialog` component.

- **`PaymentMethodStripeConnectedDialog` class in `payment-method-stripe-connected-dialog.js`**: This class manages the UI for the Stripe payment method settings. It may need to be updated to include logic for displaying the success banner when the Stripe account is connected successfully.

- **`createSuccess`, `oauthConnectSuccess`, `function_23`, and `function_29` in `actions.js`**: These functions handle the success states of various Stripe Connect account creation and OAuth processes. They may need to be updated to dispatch an action that triggers the display of the success banner. Additionally, the success actions should ensure that the success state is properly stored in the Redux store so that the UI can reflect it.
