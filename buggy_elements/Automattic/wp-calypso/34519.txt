### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the nudge to download the mobile app was removed from the Checklist "congratulations" screen. The goal is to add this nudge back to the screen after a user completes all their tasks.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is likely due to the removal of the relevant code that displays the app nudge on the "congratulations" screen. This could involve changes in the routing, rendering logic, or the components responsible for displaying the app nudge.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx`
This file contains the `AppBanner` class, which is responsible for rendering a promotional banner for a mobile app. This class could be relevant if the app nudge is implemented using a similar banner component.

class: AppBanner
```

#### `client/blocks/app-promo/index.jsx`
This file contains the `AppPromo` class, which manages the display and interaction of a promotional item for a desktop application. While this class is related to promotions, it is specific to desktop apps and may not be directly relevant to the mobile app nudge.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/my-sites/checklist/index.js`
This file sets up routing for the onboarding checklist feature. It defines routes for the checklist, which could be relevant for integrating the app nudge into the "congratulations" screen.

```
client/my-sites/checklist/index.js
function: function_1
```

#### `client/state/selectors/is-eligible-for-checkout-to-checklist.js`
This file contains functions that determine eligibility for the onboarding checklist after checkout. While it is related to the checklist feature, it does not directly involve rendering the app nudge.
