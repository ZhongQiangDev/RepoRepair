### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the "Upcoming Charges" section feels out of place and tacked on within the current billing history page layout. The suggestion is to move this section to a more appropriate location, such as under "Pending Payments" or into its own "Upcoming Charges" tab.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is primarily related to the current layout and structure of the billing history page. The "Upcoming Charges" section is currently rendered as part of the main billing history content, which makes it seem like an afterthought rather than a distinct and important section. To fix this, the layout needs to be reorganized to give the "Upcoming Charges" section its own dedicated space or tab.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `client/me/billing-history/billing-history-table.jsx`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `BillingHistoryTable` class is responsible for rendering the billing history table, but it does not directly handle the layout or placement of the "Upcoming Charges" section.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/me/billing-history/main.jsx`

This file contains the `BillingHistory` function, which is responsible for rendering the entire billing history page. The "Upcoming Charges" section is conditionally rendered within this function based on the `pastTransactions` prop. To move the "Upcoming Charges" section to a separate tab or location, changes would need to be made here.

```
client/me/billing-history/main.jsx
function: BillingHistory
```

#### `client/me/billing-history/transactions-header.jsx`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `TransactionsHeader` class is responsible for rendering the header of the transactions table and does not directly relate to the layout of the "Upcoming Charges" section.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx`

This file contains the `UpcomingChargesTable` class, which is responsible for rendering the "Upcoming Charges" table. While this class is important for displaying the upcoming charges, it does not control the layout or placement of the section within the billing history page.

```
client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx
class: UpcomingChargesTable
```

#### `client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js`

This file contains the `getUpcomingBillingTransactions` function, which is a selector used to retrieve upcoming billing transactions from the Redux state. This function is relevant because it provides the data needed for the "Upcoming Charges" section, but it does not control the layout or placement of the section.

```
client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js
function: getUpcomingBillingTransactions
```
