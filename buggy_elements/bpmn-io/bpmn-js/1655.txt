### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `setColor` API is used to change the color of elements with external labels, the external labels are set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior, where external labels should be set to the "stroke" color, similar to embedded labels.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `setColor` API is implemented. Specifically, the function responsible for applying the color to the elements might not be correctly distinguishing between "fill" and "stroke" colors for external labels. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the color assignment logic or an incorrect mapping of color properties when updating the external label's style.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/draw/TextRenderer.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/SetColorHandler.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/SetColorHandler.js
function: function_2
function: function_3
```

The `function_2` and `function_3` methods in `SetColorHandler` are responsible for updating the color properties of elements. These functions create a `di` object to store the color properties and then update the element properties using the `element.updateProperties` command. The issue might be in how these functions handle the color properties for external labels.

#### --- lib/util/LabelUtil.js ---
```
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
function: getExternalLabelBounds
function: hasExternalLabel
function: isLabelExternal
```

The `getExternalLabelBounds`, `hasExternalLabel`, and `isLabelExternal` functions are relevant because they deal with external labels. The `getExternalLabelBounds` function calculates the bounds for external labels, and the `hasExternalLabel` and `isLabelExternal` functions determine if an element has an external label. These functions might be indirectly involved in the issue if the color assignment logic relies on correctly identifying and handling external labels.
