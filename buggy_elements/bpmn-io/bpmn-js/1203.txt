### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, it loses its properties such as Async Continuations and Job Configurations.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the properties of the Intermediate Event are handled during the copy-paste operation when it is pasted as a Boundary Event. Specifically, the properties might not be correctly transferred or preserved during the transformation from an Intermediate Event to a Boundary Event.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`

This file contains functions related to copying and pasting BPMN elements. The `BpmnCopyPaste` function and its associated events (`copyPaste.copyElement`, `copyPaste.pasteElements`, `copyPaste.pasteElement`) are directly involved in the copy-paste operation. The `moddleCopy` utility is used to copy properties, but it might not be handling the transformation from Intermediate Event to Boundary Event correctly.

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js`

This file contains the `AttachEventBehavior` function, which handles attaching events to other elements. It might be relevant if the issue involves the transformation of an Intermediate Event into a Boundary Event during the attach operation.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
function: AttachEventBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js`

This file contains the `CreateBoundaryEventBehavior` function, which handles the creation of Boundary Events. It might be relevant if the issue involves the creation of a Boundary Event from an Intermediate Event.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
function: CreateBoundaryEventBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js`

This file contains functions related to updating properties of BPMN elements. While it might not be directly related to the copy-paste operation, it could be relevant if the properties are not being correctly updated during the transformation.

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
function: function_2
function: function_4
```

#### `lib/util/DiUtil.js`

This file contains utility functions related to BPMN elements. It might not be directly related to the copy-paste operation or the transformation of events.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
