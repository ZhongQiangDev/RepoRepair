### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a Pool is copied and pasted, it results in duplicate Pool IDs. This causes issues when exporting and importing the BPMN diagram, as the duplicate IDs lead to errors during the import process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely related to how the Pool's ID is handled during the copy and paste operation. Specifically, the ID of the copied Pool is not being properly reset or updated when the Pool is pasted, leading to duplicate IDs in the BPMN XML.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js ---
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
```
The `BpmnCopyPaste` function is responsible for managing the copy and paste operations. It needs to ensure that when a Pool is copied and pasted, its ID is properly reset to avoid duplicates. The function should remove the ID from the copied Pool and assign a new unique ID when pasting.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` ensures that a BPMN element has a unique identifier (ID). This function should be called when pasting a Pool to assign a new unique ID.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_18
```
The `function_18` updates the parent references for a given BPMN element. This function might be relevant if the parent references need to be updated when pasting a Pool.

#### --- lib/import/BpmnImporter.js ---
```
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
function: function_6
```
The `function_6` handles the addition of BPMN elements to the canvas. This function might be relevant if there are issues with how the Pool is added during the import process.

#### --- lib/util/ModelUtil.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in `ModelUtil.js` are utility functions that do not directly handle the copy-paste or ID generation logic. Therefore, they are not directly relevant to the issue.
