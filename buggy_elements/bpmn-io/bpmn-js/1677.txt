### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when an element is deleted while direct editing is active, an `illegal invocation` exception occurs. This exception is triggered during the `<execute>` or `<revert>` phase of the `element.updateLabel` action. The editor crashes as a result.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the timing and sequence of operations when an element is deleted while direct editing is active. Specifically:

- The direct editing mode is active, and the label of an element is being edited.
- The user attempts to delete the element via the context pad.
- The deletion operation conflicts with the ongoing label editing operation, leading to an `illegal invocation` exception.

This suggests that the label editing operation is not properly terminated or cleaned up before the deletion operation is executed, causing a conflict in the command stack.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/context-pad/ContextPadProvider.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingPreview.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js`

```
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
function: function_12
function: LabelEditingProvider
```

The `function_12` function is relevant because it updates the label of an element, which is directly related to the `element.updateLabel` action mentioned in the error message. This function might need to be inspected to ensure it properly handles the termination of label editing when an element is deleted. The `LabelEditingProvider` function enables and manages direct label editing for BPMN elements, which is relevant to the issue.

#### `lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
function: function_3
```

The `function_3` function is relevant because it executes the `element.updateLabel` command, which is the action that triggers the `illegal invocation` exception. This function might need to be inspected to ensure it properly handles the execution and revert phases of the command.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. `lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js`
   - `function: function_12`
   - `function: LabelEditingProvider`
