### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the deep linking overlay for the subprocess is lost when navigating between multiple processes and subprocesses inside the same BPMN diagram. This indicates that the overlay, which should persist to allow navigation, is not being maintained correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the way overlays are managed when navigating between subprocesses and global subprocesses. Specifically, the overlay management might not be properly synchronized with the navigation events or the state changes of the subprocesses. This could be due to missing or incorrect event listeners, or the overlay being removed or not updated when the subprocess is navigated away from or back to.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js`

```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js
function: DrilldownOverlayBehavior
function: canDrillDown
function: addOverlay
function: removeOverlay
function: updateOverlayVisibility
```

This file is highly relevant as it manages the addition and removal of overlays on shapes, particularly when shapes are collapsed or expanded. The deep linking overlay issue might be related to how overlays are added or removed during these operations.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeLaneBehavior.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js
function: function_23
function: function_25
function: function_27
function: function_29
class: SubProcessPlaneBehavior
```

The `SubProcessPlaneBehavior` class and its functions `function_23` (`moveChildren`), `function_25` (`_showRecursively`), `function_27` (`_createNewDiagram`), and `function_29` (`removeDiagram`) are relevant as they manage the lifecycle of BPMNPlane elements associated with collapsed subprocesses. These functions need to be inspected to ensure they correctly handle the creation, removal, and synchronization of subprocess planes, which could affect the overlay management.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleCollapseConnectionBehaviour.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary

The relevant files and functions/classes that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js
function: DrilldownOverlayBehavior
function: canDrillDown
function: addOverlay
function: removeOverlay
function: updateOverlayVisibility

lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js
function: function_23
function: function_25
function: function_27
function: function_29
class: SubProcessPlaneBehavior
```
