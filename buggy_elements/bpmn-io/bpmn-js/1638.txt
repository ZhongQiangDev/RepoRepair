### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that when the label of a Task is removed, the `di.label` property still exists with a value of `null`. This causes issues with other tools, such as linting, because they expect the `di.label` property to be completely removed if the label is empty.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the label is being removed or updated in the BPMN diagram. Specifically, when the label is cleared, the `di.label` property is not being properly deleted from the diagram interchange (DI) information. Instead, it is being set to `null`, which is not the expected behavior according to the issue description.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js

This file contains functions related to label editing, but it does not directly handle the removal of the `di.label` property. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js

This file contains the `LabelBehavior` function, which manages the lifecycle of labels associated with BPMN elements. It includes logic for updating labels when properties change, creating labels for new elements, and updating the DI information when a label is created. However, it does not explicitly handle the removal of the `di.label` property when the label is cleared.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
function: LabelBehavior
```

#### lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js

This file contains the `UpdatePropertiesHandler` function and related methods, which handle updating properties for elements within a BPMN diagram. The `function_3` method updates the properties of an element's label, but it does not handle the removal of the `di.label` property when the label is cleared.

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
function: function_3
```

#### lib/util/DiUtil.js

This file contains utility functions related to BPMN elements and their properties, but it does not directly handle the removal of the `di.label` property. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lib/util/LabelUtil.js

This file contains utility functions related to labels, including `getExternalLabelBounds`, `getExternalLabelMid`, and `hasExternalLabel`. These functions are used to calculate label positions and check for external labels, but they do not handle the removal of the `di.label` property when the label is cleared.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the following locations are relevant to the issue:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
function: LabelBehavior

lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
function: function_3
```
