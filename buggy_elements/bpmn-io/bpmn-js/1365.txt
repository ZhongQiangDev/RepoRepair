### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the BPMN 2.0 specification allows data objects to have an `isCollection` marker, but the current implementation does not support toggling this marker on data objects, inputs, or outputs. The desired behavior is to implement the ability to toggle `isCollection = true` on a data object, similar to how multiple/ad-hoc modifiers are handled for user tasks.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the lack of implementation for toggling the `isCollection` property on data objects. This involves both the visual representation of the `isCollection` marker in the diagram and the underlying model that stores this property. The current implementation does not include the necessary logic to handle this property, which results in the inability to mark data objects as collections.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js ---
```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
function: function_86
```
The `getShapePath` function is responsible for generating the SVG path for different BPMN elements. To support the `isCollection` marker, this function may need to be modified to include a specific path or marker for data objects that are collections.

#### --- lib/draw/BpmnRenderUtil.js ---
```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderUtil.js
function: isCollection
```
The `isCollection` function checks if an element or its data object is a collection. This function will be relevant for determining whether to apply the `isCollection` marker when rendering data objects.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
function: function_4
```
The `create` function is used to create new BPMN elements. To support the `isCollection` property, this function may need to be modified to allow setting the `isCollection` property when creating data objects.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateDataObjectBehavior.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateDataObjectBehavior.js
function: CreateDataObjectBehavior
```
The `CreateDataObjectBehavior` function listens for the creation of `DataObjectReference` and creates a corresponding `DataObject`. This function may need to be modified to set the `isCollection` property when creating the `DataObject`.

#### --- lib/util/DiUtil.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to checking event definitions and expanded states, which are not directly relevant to the `isCollection` property for data objects.
