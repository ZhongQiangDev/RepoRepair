### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a `call activity` is morphed into an `expanded subprocess`, the resulting subprocess does not include a start event, unlike when a `task` is morphed into an `expanded subprocess`. This leads to a confusing user experience because the subprocess appears as a small shape similar to a task, rather than an expanded subprocess with a start event.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the morphing behavior of the BPMN modeler. Specifically, the process of converting a `call activity` to an `expanded subprocess` does not trigger the same logic that adds a start event as when a `task` is converted to an `expanded subprocess`. This suggests that the morphing logic for `call activities` might be missing or incorrectly configured to handle the addition of a start event.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBehavior.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js
function: SubProcessStartEventBehavior
```

The `SubProcessStartEventBehavior` function is relevant because it is responsible for adding a start event to an expanded subprocess. It listens to events like 'create.start', 'shape.create', and 'shape.replace' to determine if a start event should be added. However, it may not be correctly handling the case when a `call activity` is morphed into an `expanded subprocess`.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js`

```
lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js
function: BpmnReplace
```

The `BpmnReplace` function is relevant because it handles the replacement of BPMN elements, including morphing a `call activity` into an `expanded subprocess`. It may need to be modified to ensure that the morphing process includes the addition of a start event.
