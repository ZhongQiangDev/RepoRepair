### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when users copy and paste the contents of a participant (a pool or lane) in a BPMN diagram, the labels associated with the elements within the participant are not preserved. This results in a diagram that is missing labels after the paste operation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way labels are handled during the copy and paste process. Specifically, the labels may not be correctly identified, copied, or pasted along with their associated elements. This could be due to:

- The copy operation not capturing the label information properly.
- The paste operation not correctly restoring the labels.
- The label information being lost or not properly linked to the elements during the copy/paste process.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`

This file contains functions directly related to the copy and paste functionality, which is where the issue is likely occurring. The following functions are relevant:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
function: copyProperties
function: isLabel
function: removeProperties
function: setProperties
```

#### `lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js`

This file contains functions related to label editing, which may be indirectly related to the issue if the labels are not being correctly handled during the copy/paste process. However, the primary issue seems to be in the copy/paste functionality, so this file may not be directly relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`

This file contains functions related to label behavior, which may be relevant if the labels are not being correctly updated or maintained during the copy/paste process. However, the primary issue seems to be in the copy/paste functionality, so this file may not be directly relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/util/LabelUtil.js`

This file contains utility functions related to labels, which may be relevant if the labels are not being correctly calculated or positioned during the copy/paste process. However, the primary issue seems to be in the copy/paste functionality, so this file may not be directly relevant.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The primary file that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`. The functions `BpmnCopyPaste`, `copyProperties`, `isLabel`, `removeProperties`, and `setProperties` are all potentially relevant to the issue.
