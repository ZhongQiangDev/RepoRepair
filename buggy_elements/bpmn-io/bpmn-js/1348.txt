### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the Camunda Modeler disallows connecting a message flow to an intermediate message catch boundary event, even though this should be allowed according to the BPMN 2.0 specification. The modeler prevents the connection from being made, as shown in the video.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the rules that govern the creation and validation of connections within the BPMN diagram. Specifically, the rules that determine whether a connection can be made between a source and target element may not be correctly configured to allow message flows to target intermediate message catch boundary events. This could be due to an incorrect implementation of the BPMN 2.0 specification within the Camunda Modeler.

function: canConnectMessageFlow
function: isMessageFlowTarget
function: isBoundaryCandidate
function: isBoundaryEvent
```

The `canConnect` function is responsible for determining whether a connection can be established between a source and target element. It calls `canConnectMessageFlow` to check if a message flow can be established, which in turn calls `isMessageFlowTarget` to determine if the target element is a valid target for a message flow. The `isBoundaryCandidate` and `isBoundaryEvent` functions are used to determine if an element is a boundary event, which is relevant to the issue since the target is an intermediate message catch boundary event. These functions need to be examined to ensure they correctly handle the case of intermediate message catch boundary events as valid targets for message flows.
