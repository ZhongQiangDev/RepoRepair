### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when an expanded Sub Process is collapsed and then turned into an Ad Hoc Sub Process, the dimensions of the Sub Process change unexpectedly. The expected behavior is that the dimensions should remain unchanged.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the dimensions of the Sub Process are recalculated or updated when it is collapsed and then transformed into an Ad Hoc Sub Process. This could involve incorrect handling of the bounds or resizing logic when the Sub Process's state changes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`

This file contains functions that handle updates to BPMN elements, including bounds and parent updates. The following functions are relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_19
function: updateBounds
function: updateParent
```

- `function_19` (`updateDiParent`): This function updates the parent reference in the diagram interchange (DI) layer, which could be relevant if the parent reference is incorrectly updated when the Sub Process is collapsed or transformed.
- `updateBounds`: This function updates the bounds of shapes, which is directly related to the dimensions of the Sub Process.
- `updateParent`: This function updates the parent of shapes and connections, which could be relevant if the parent update affects the dimensions.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js`

This file contains functions related to label positioning, which may not directly affect the dimensions of the Sub Process. However, it's worth checking if label adjustments interfere with the Sub Process's dimensions:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js
function: AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`

This file contains functions related to replacing elements, which could be relevant if the transformation to an Ad Hoc Sub Process involves replacing the original Sub Process:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
function: function_6
function: ReplaceElementBehaviour
```

- `function_6` (`replaceElements`): This function replaces elements in the BPMN diagram, which could be relevant if the transformation involves replacing the Sub Process.
- `ReplaceElementBehaviour`: This function handles the behavior of elements when they are replaced, which could affect the dimensions if not handled correctly.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`

This file contains functions related to resizing behavior, which is directly relevant to the dimensions of elements:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
function: ResizeBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`

This file contains functions related to toggling the collapse state of elements, which is directly relevant to the issue:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
function: filterVisible
function: ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour
```

- `filterVisible`: This function filters visible elements, which could be relevant if hidden elements affect the dimensions.
- `ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour`: This function handles the collapse and expansion of elements, which is directly related to the issue.

### Summary

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
