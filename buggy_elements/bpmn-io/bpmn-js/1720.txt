### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a Call Activity is transformed into an Expanded SubProcess, the shape does not resize appropriately, and the wrench menu options become limited, preventing the user from reverting the element back to a Call Activity. This results in a "dead end" where the user cannot easily change the element type back.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the way the BPMN modeler handles the transformation of elements from one type to another. Specifically, the issue could be related to:

- **Incorrect handling of element type transformation**: When the Call Activity is transformed into an Expanded SubProcess, the modeler might not properly update the visual representation and the associated properties of the element.
- **Limited menu options after transformation**: The wrench menu options might not be dynamically updated based on the current element type, leading to a situation where the user cannot revert the element type.
- **Resizing logic**: The resizing logic for the Expanded SubProcess might not be correctly applied, resulting in the shape not resizing as expected.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`

This file contains functions that handle updates to BPMN elements, including resizing and updating connections. The following functions might be relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: updateBounds
function: updateConnectionWaypoints
function: updateParent
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`

This file contains functions that handle the replacement of elements in the BPMN diagram. The following functions might be relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
function: function_6
function: function_7
function: function_8
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`

This file contains functions that handle resizing behavior for different types of BPMN elements. The following function might be relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
function: ResizeBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js`

This file contains functions that handle the behavior of sub-process planes, including adding and removing diagrams. The following functions might be relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js
function: function_23
function: function_28
function: function_30
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`

This file contains functions that handle the collapse and expansion of BPMN sub-process elements. The following function might be relevant:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
function: ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour
```

### Summary

The identified functions and classes in the relevant files are likely involved in the issue described in the GitHub problem. These functions handle element transformation, resizing, and menu options, which are all relevant to the described behavior.
