### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after adding and then removing a lane from a pool, it becomes impossible to connect a message flow to the boundary of the pool by dropping the connector inside the single lane of the pool. Instead, the connector can only be dropped at the header of the pool.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the modeling tool handles the internal state of the pool after a lane is added and then removed. When a lane is added and removed, the pool's internal structure may not be properly reset, causing the tool to treat the pool as if it still has multiple lanes. This could affect the logic that determines where message flows can be connected.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---
```
function: function_27
```
The `function_27` function updates connection details in a BPMN diagram. It might need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles the connection logic when a lane is added and removed.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js ---
```
function: function_4
```
The `function_4` function creates connections between elements. It might need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles the connection logic when a lane is added and removed.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/util/LaneUtil.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/util/LaneUtil.js
function: collectLanes
function: getChildLanes
function: computeLanesResize
```
The `collectLanes`, `getChildLanes`, and `computeLanesResize` functions are related to lane management. They might need to be inspected to ensure they correctly handle the internal state of the pool after a lane is added and removed.

#### --- lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js ---
```
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
function: canConnect
function: canConnectMessageFlow
```
The `canConnect` and `canConnectMessageFlow` functions determine if a connection can be made between elements. They might need to be inspected to ensure they correctly handle the connection logic when a lane is added and removed.
