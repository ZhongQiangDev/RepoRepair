### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when multiple Boundary Events are moved out of their host shape in a batch operation, they are not converted to Intermediate Events as expected. Instead, they remain as Boundary Events, which is incorrect according to BPMN standards.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises because the current logic for handling the movement of Boundary Events does not account for batch operations. Specifically, the `DetachEventBehavior` function is designed to handle the detachment of a single Boundary Event, but it does not handle the case where multiple Boundary Events are moved simultaneously. As a result, the Boundary Events are not properly converted to Intermediate Events when moved out of their host in a batch.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js
function: DetachEventBehavior
function: getEventDefinition
```

The `DetachEventBehavior` function is relevant because it handles the detachment of Boundary Events. The `getEventDefinition` function is also relevant because it retrieves the first event definition associated with a given business object element.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js ---
```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
function: ReplaceElementBehaviour
```

The `ReplaceElementBehaviour` function is relevant because it handles the replacement of elements, which could be extended to handle the conversion of Boundary Events to Intermediate Events during batch moves.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
