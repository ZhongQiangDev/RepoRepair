### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after pasting elements with a task in the first position, direct editing is activated for the task element. This is unexpected because direct editing should not be activated at all after pasting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the logic that handles the pasting of elements and the activation of direct editing. Specifically, the issue might be related to how the system determines which elements should be selected or edited after pasting. If the task element in the first position is being selected or focused automatically, it could trigger the direct editing mode.
