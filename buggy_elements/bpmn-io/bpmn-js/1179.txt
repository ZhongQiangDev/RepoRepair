### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an element is dropped onto a sequence flow, the layout of the sequence flow breaks. Specifically, the docking of the new incoming sequence flow is always positioned at the top left corner, which disrupts the intended layout.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the docking points for the new sequence flow are being calculated or applied when an element is dropped onto an existing sequence flow. The docking points may not be correctly updated or recalculated to reflect the new position of the dropped element, causing the sequence flow to default to the top left corner.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/auto-place/AutoPlace.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
function: function_2
```

The `function_2` function is responsible for determining the optimal path for a BPMN connection, including sequence flows. It may need to be inspected to ensure that it correctly handles the docking points when a new element is dropped onto an existing sequence flow.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
function: DropOnFlowBehavior
```

The `DropOnFlowBehavior` function handles the logic for dropping elements onto flows. It includes the `insertShape` function, which calculates the intersection point between the shape and the flow, splits the flow's waypoints, and reconnects the flow to the inserted shape. This function may need to be inspected to ensure that it correctly updates the docking points for the new sequence flow.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js`

```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js
function: BpmnConnectSnapping
```

The `BpmnConnectSnapping` function manages the snapping behavior when connecting elements in a BPMN diagram. It may need to be inspected to ensure that it correctly handles the snapping of the new sequence flow when an element is dropped onto an existing sequence flow.
