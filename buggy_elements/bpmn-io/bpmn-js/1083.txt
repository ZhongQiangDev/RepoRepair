### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the snapping functionality for docking points between connected elements in BPMN diagrams is not working in version `4.0.0-beta.1`. In `v3.x`, when moving an element, it would snap to the docking points of other elements, ensuring proper alignment. However, in `v4.0.0-beta.1`, this snapping behavior is missing, leading to misalignment when elements are moved.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in changes made to the snapping or docking logic between versions `v3.x` and `v4.0.0-beta.1`. The snapping functionality is responsible for ensuring that elements align correctly with each other when moved. If this logic has been altered or removed in the new version, it would result in the observed behavior where elements no longer snap to docking points.

```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js
function: BpmnCreateMoveSnapping
function: setSnappedIfConstrained
```
This file likely contains the snapping logic for moving elements. The `BpmnCreateMoveSnapping` function and `setSnappedIfConstrained` function may need to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles snapping to docking points.

#### --- lib/features/snapping/BpmnSnappingUtil.js ---
```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnSnappingUtil.js
function: getBoundaryAttachment
function: addToTrbl
function: addMax
function: addMin
```
This file contains utility functions related to snapping. The `getBoundaryAttachment` function may be responsible for determining the correct docking point for an element. The `addToTrbl`, `addMax`, and `addMin` functions may be involved in adjusting the position of elements to ensure they snap correctly. These functions should be inspected to ensure they are correctly calculating and applying snapping behavior.
