### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that group elements are not rendered on top of all other elements. Specifically, when a new element is created on a group's border, the group borders are not hidden behind the new element, as shown in the screenshot. The expected behavior is that groups should always be rendered on top of all other elements.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the ordering of elements during rendering. The group elements should be rendered last or have a higher z-index so that they appear on top of other elements. The problem might be related to how the rendering order is determined or how the z-index is assigned to different elements.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js ---
This file contains functions related to rendering BPMN elements. The issue might be related to how the rendering order is determined or how the z-index is assigned to different elements.

```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
function: function_84
function: function_85
```

- `function_84` (`drawShape`): This function is responsible for drawing shapes. It might need to ensure that group elements are rendered with a higher z-index.
- `function_85` (`drawConnection`): This function is responsible for drawing connections. It might need to ensure that group elements are rendered with a higher z-index.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js ---
This file contains functions related to modeling operations. While it does not directly handle rendering, it might influence the structure of the elements being rendered.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/features/ordering/BpmnOrderingProvider.js ---
This file contains the `BpmnOrderingProvider` class, which is responsible for determining the rendering order of BPMN elements. This is likely where the issue lies.

```
lib/features/ordering/BpmnOrderingProvider.js
class: BpmnOrderingProvider
```

- `BpmnOrderingProvider`: This class defines the ordering rules for different BPMN element types. It might need to be adjusted to ensure that group elements are rendered on top.

#### --- lib/import/BpmnImporter.js ---
This file contains functions related to importing BPMN elements. It does not directly handle rendering or ordering.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/util/LabelUtil.js ---
This file contains utility functions related to labels. It does not directly handle rendering or ordering.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
