### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `DataObjectReference` replace menu only contains the collection marker, making it feel empty and out of place. The user suggests that the menu should allow switching between `DataObjectReference` and `DataStoreReference` to ensure the menu is always populated with relevant options.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the current implementation of the replace menu for `DataObjectReference` elements. The menu is not configured to include options for switching to `DataStoreReference`, which results in the menu appearing sparse and not providing the desired functionality.

### Explanation

- **lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js**: The `function_6` (`replaceElements`) is relevant because it handles the replacement of elements in the BPMN diagram. This function could be extended or modified to support the replacement of `DataObjectReference` with `DataStoreReference` and vice versa.

- **lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js**: 
  - `function_3`: This function generates replacement options for a given BPMN element. It needs to be updated to include options for switching between `DataObjectReference` and `DataStoreReference`.
  - `function_11`: This function creates menu entries based on the replacement options. It should be modified to include the new options.
  - `function_23`: This function creates a menu item for toggling the `isCollection` property of a `DataObjectReference`. It could be extended to include the option for switching to `DataStoreReference`.

The other files do not contain functions or classes directly related to the issue described in the GitHub problem description.
