### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that users cannot easily connect two tasks center-to-center in the BPMN diagram editor after the introduction of connection previews and grid snapping. The connection process is hindered, and the expected center-to-center snapping is missing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the grid snapping functionality interfering with the center-to-center connection process. The grid snapping may be enforcing alignment to grid lines rather than allowing for precise center-to-center alignment between tasks. Additionally, the connection previews might not be accurately reflecting the intended connection path, leading to confusion and difficulty in achieving the desired connection.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js`

This file contains the `BpmnGridSnapping` function, which handles grid snapping for certain BPMN elements. Since the issue involves grid snapping interfering with center-to-center connections, this function is directly relevant.

```
lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js
function: BpmnGridSnapping
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AppendBehavior.js`

This file contains the `AppendBehavior` function, which handles the positioning of shapes when they are appended to other shapes. While this function is related to positioning, it does not directly handle connections between shapes. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue described.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js`

This file contains the `DropOnFlowBehavior` function, which handles the scenario where a shape is dropped onto a flow in a BPMN diagram. Although this function deals with connections, it is more focused on dropping shapes onto flows rather than connecting tasks center-to-center. However, the `getMid` function within this file calculates the midpoint of a rectangle, which could be relevant for center-to-center connections.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
function: getMid
```

#### `lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js`

This file is likely to contain functions related to snapping during the connection process. Since the issue involves difficulty in connecting tasks center-to-center, this file is highly relevant.

```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js
function: BpmnConnectSnapping
function: snapBoundaryEventLoop
function: snapInsideTarget
```
