### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that it is possible to connect a message flow to a boundary event, which should not be allowed according to BPMN semantics. The connection should be disallowed when attempting to connect a participant (`B`) to a boundary event.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the rules that govern the creation and validation of connections within the BPMN diagram. Specifically, the rules that determine whether a connection can be made between a source and target element are not correctly enforcing the BPMN semantics that prohibit connecting a message flow to a boundary event.

This file contains the `BpmnRules` function and related methods that enforce BPMN-specific rules. The `canConnect` method is responsible for evaluating whether a connection can be established between a source and target element. This method checks various conditions to determine if the connection is allowed, including the types of the source and target elements. The `isMessageFlowTarget` and `isMessageFlowSource` methods are also relevant, as they determine if an element can be a valid source or target for a message flow.
