### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that an error is thrown when attempting to morph a `DataStoreReference` to a `DataObjectReference` outside of a Pool. The error message indicates that the function `updateDiParent` is trying to access a property of an undefined object, specifically the `get` method.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error occurs because the `updateDiParent` function is being called with an invalid or undefined `parentDi` parameter when the morph operation is performed outside of a Pool. This suggests that the parent reference is not being correctly set or is not available when the function is executed, leading to the `TypeError`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js ---

This file contains the `BpmnUpdater` function and several related methods, including `updateDiParent`, which is directly involved in the error.

```
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
function: function_22
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js ---

This file contains methods related to modeling operations but does not directly handle the morphing of elements or updating parent references.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js ---

This file contains the `ReplaceElementBehaviour` function and related methods, which handle the replacement of elements in the BPMN diagram. The `replaceElements` method could be involved in the morphing operation.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
function: function_6
function: function_7
class: ReplaceElementBehaviour
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js ---

This file contains the `UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler` function and related methods, which handle updating flow node references. While it is related to updating references, it does not directly handle the morphing operation or parent updates.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/features/modeling/util/ModelingUtil.js ---

This file contains utility functions like `getParent` and `isAny`, which could be indirectly involved in determining parent relationships.

```
lib/features/modeling/util/ModelingUtil.js
function: getParent
function: isAny
```
