### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a subprocess is wrapped in a pool, the diagram jumps unexpectedly. The expected behavior is that the diagram should stay within the current viewport without any sudden jumps.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the view is being adjusted when the subprocess is wrapped in a pool. Specifically, the issue might be related to how the canvas is being scrolled or zoomed during this process. The `DrilldownCentering` function is responsible for adjusting the view when a user drills down into a subprocess, so it is a prime candidate for investigation. Additionally, the `CreateParticipantBehavior` function, which handles the creation of a participant shape, might also be involved if it inadvertently triggers a view adjustment.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js`

This file contains the `DrilldownCentering` function, which is directly related to the issue. This function is responsible for adjusting the view when a user drills down into a subprocess. If the function is not correctly managing the view adjustments, it could cause the diagram to jump unexpectedly.

```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
function: DrilldownCentering
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateParticipantBehavior.js`

This file contains the `CreateParticipantBehavior` function, which is responsible for handling the creation of a participant shape. If this function is not correctly managing the view adjustments when a participant is created, it could also contribute to the issue.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateParticipantBehavior.js
function: CreateParticipantBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`

This file contains the `ResizeBehavior` function, which handles resizing behavior for different types of BPMN elements. While this function is not directly related to the issue of wrapping a subprocess in a pool, it might be indirectly involved if the resizing of elements affects the view.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
function: ResizeBehavior
```

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`

This file contains the `ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour` function, which handles the collapse and expansion of BPMN sub-process elements. While this function is not directly related to the issue of wrapping a subprocess in a pool, it might be indirectly involved if the collapse/expand behavior affects the view.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
function: ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour
```

#### `lib/util/LabelUtil.js`

This file contains various utility functions related to labels. These functions are not directly related to the issue of wrapping a subprocess in a pool and adjusting the view.
