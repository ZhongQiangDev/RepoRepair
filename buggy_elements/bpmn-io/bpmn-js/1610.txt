### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the direct editing box remains open after switching planes, even though the element being edited is no longer visible. This indicates that the direct editing state is not properly canceled when the plane is switched.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the direct editing state is not being properly managed when the active plane changes. Specifically, the direct editing box should be closed or canceled when the plane is switched, but this is not happening. This could be due to a missing event listener or a failure to properly handle the event that triggers the plane switch.

The `LabelEditingProvider` function is responsible for managing direct editing of labels. It listens to various events to control the activation, completion, and cancellation of the editing process. The `function_9` (activate) function is responsible for enabling direct editing of labels. However, it does not seem to handle the cancellation of direct editing when the plane is switched.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
function: LabelEditingProvider
function: function_9
```

These functions are relevant because they manage the direct editing of labels and should be inspected to ensure that the direct editing state is properly canceled when the plane is switched. Specifically, the `LabelEditingProvider` should listen for events related to plane switching and cancel the direct editing state accordingly. The `function_9` (activate) function may need to be modified to include logic for handling plane switches.
