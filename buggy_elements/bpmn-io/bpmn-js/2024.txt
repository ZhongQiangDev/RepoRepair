### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the pool and lane labels are not being rendered correctly when the pool is set to a vertical orientation. Specifically, the labels are not aligned or positioned properly, leading to a misrepresentation of the BPMN diagram.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the rendering logic not accounting for the orientation of the pool (`isHorizontal="false"`). The rendering functions responsible for drawing shapes and labels may be assuming a horizontal orientation by default and do not adjust their behavior when a vertical orientation is specified.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js ---
This file contains functions responsible for rendering BPMN elements, including shapes and labels. The issue likely involves how labels are rendered and positioned relative to their parent elements.

```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
function: function_94
function: function_92
function: function_93
```

- `function_94` (`getShapePath`): This function generates the SVG path for rendering different types of BPMN elements. It may need to consider the orientation of the pool when generating paths for vertical pools.
- `function_92` (`drawShape`): This function is responsible for rendering shapes. It may need to adjust the rendering logic based on the orientation of the pool.
- `function_93` (`drawConnection`): This function renders connections. It may need to adjust the rendering logic based on the orientation of the pool.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js ---
This file contains functions responsible for managing the positioning of external labels. The issue may involve how labels are positioned relative to their parent elements when the orientation changes.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js
function: getOptimalPosition
function: getTakenConnectionAlignments
function: getTakenHostAlignments
```

- `getOptimalPosition`: This function calculates the optimal position for a label relative to an element. It may need to consider the orientation of the pool when determining the optimal position.
- `getTakenConnectionAlignments`: This function determines the alignments taken by connections related to an element. It may need to adjust the alignment logic based on the orientation of the pool.
- `getTakenHostAlignments`: This function determines the alignments taken by the host element. It may need to adjust the alignment logic based on the orientation of the pool.

#### --- lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js ---
This file contains functions responsible for managing external labels. The issue may involve how labels are created and positioned when the orientation changes.

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
function: LabelBehavior
function: getReferencePoint
function: getReferencePointDelta
```

- `LabelBehavior`: This function manages external labels. It may need to adjust the label creation and positioning logic based on the orientation of the pool.
- `getReferencePoint`: This function calculates the nearest reference point on a set of lines. It may need to adjust the reference point calculation based on the orientation of the pool.
- `getReferencePointDelta`: This function calculates the change in the position of a reference point. It may need to adjust the delta calculation based on the orientation of the pool.

#### --- lib/import/BpmnImporter.js ---
This file contains functions responsible for importing BPMN elements. The issue may involve how elements and their labels are imported when the orientation changes.

```
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
function: function_8
function: function_6
```

- `function_8` (`addLabel`): This function creates and attaches a label to an element. It may need to adjust the label creation and attachment logic based on the orientation of the pool.
- `function_6` (`add`): This function adds BPMN elements to the canvas. It may need to adjust the element addition logic based on the orientation of the pool.

#### --- lib/util/LabelUtil.js ---
This file contains functions responsible for calculating label bounds and positions. The issue may involve how label bounds and positions are calculated when the orientation changes.

```
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
function: getExternalLabelBounds
function: getExternalLabelMid
function: getFlowLabelPosition
```

- `getExternalLabelBounds`: This function calculates the bounds of an external label. It may need to adjust the bounds calculation based on the orientation of the pool.
- `getExternalLabelMid`: This function calculates the midpoint of an external label. It may need to adjust the midpoint calculation based on the orientation of the pool.
- `getFlowLabelPosition`: This function calculates the position of a flow label. It may need to adjust the position calculation based on the orientation of the pool.
