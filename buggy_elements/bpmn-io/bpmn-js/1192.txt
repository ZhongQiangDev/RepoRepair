### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that boundary events cannot be copied, even though detaching boundary events is now possible. This is due to the `element.copy` rule in the BPMN rules preventing the copying of boundary events.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the `canCopy` function in the `BpmnRules.js` file. This function checks if an element can be copied based on its type and its relationship with a given collection. Specifically, it checks if the element is a `bpmn:BoundaryEvent` and if its host is contained within the collection. If the host is not in the collection, the function returns `false`, preventing the boundary event from being copied.

The `canCopy` function is directly relevant to the issue described. It needs to be modified to allow copying of boundary events when the host is not in the collection. This function should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the problem.
