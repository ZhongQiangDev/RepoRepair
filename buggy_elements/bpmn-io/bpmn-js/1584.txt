### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

#### Inconsistent Redo Behavior:
- **Issue**: When redoing the addition of the first participant, the process ID changes instead of remaining the same.
- **Expected Behavior**: The process ID should remain consistent after undoing and redoing the addition of the first participant.

#### Duplicate Pool ID When Copying:
- **Issue**: When copying a pool with a task inside and pasting it, the process ID within the copied pool is duplicated, leading to an invalid BPMN model.
- **Expected Behavior**: Each process within a pool should have a unique ID after copying and pasting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Inconsistent Redo Behavior:
- The issue likely stems from how the process ID is managed during the undo/redo operations. The ID generation or management logic might not be correctly resetting or maintaining the original ID when the participant is re-added.

#### Duplicate Pool ID When Copying:
- The problem appears to be related to the ID management during the copy-paste operation. The function responsible for copying elements might not be correctly generating new unique IDs for the copied processes, leading to ID conflicts.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/BaseModeler.js`
```
lib/BaseModeler.js
function: _collectIds
```
- **Relevance**: The `_collectIds` function manages the IDs of elements during parsing. It might need to be reviewed to ensure that it correctly handles the IDs during undo/redo operations and copy-paste actions.

#### `lib/Modeler.js`
```
lib/Modeler.js
function: createDiagram
function: _createModdle
function: _collectIds
```
- **Relevance**: The `createDiagram` function initializes a new diagram, which might be involved in setting up the initial state of the process ID. The `_createModdle` and `_collectIds` functions are related to ID management and could be relevant to the issues described.

#### `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`
```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
function: BpmnCopyPaste
function: copyProperties
function: _copyId
```
- **Relevance**: The `BpmnCopyPaste` function manages copy-paste operations. The `copyProperties` function might need to ensure that properties like IDs are correctly handled. The `_copyId` function is directly related to ID management during copy-paste and should be reviewed for potential issues.

#### `lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js`
```
lib/features/copy-paste/ModdleCopy.js
function: function_6
function: function_8
function: _copyId
```
- **Relevance**: The `function_6` and `function_8` functions handle property copying and might need to ensure that IDs are correctly managed. The `_copyId` function is crucial for ensuring that IDs are unique during copy-paste operations.

#### `lib/util/DiUtil.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
- **Relevance**: The functions in this file are related to checking event definitions and expanded states, which are not directly related to the ID management issues described.
