### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a shape (in this case, a Subprocess) is resized, the labels and associations connected to the shape do not move with it. Instead, they remain in their original positions, causing them to appear disconnected from the shape.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises because the logic responsible for moving labels and associations when a shape is resized is not correctly implemented or is missing. Specifically, the function responsible for handling the resize event of a shape does not properly update the positions of the labels and associations connected to that shape.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AssociationBehavior.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `AssociationBehavior` function handles the movement of associations when a shape is moved, not when it is resized.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
function: LabelBehavior
```

The `LabelBehavior` function is relevant because it manages the lifecycle of labels associated with BPMN elements. It includes a section specifically for handling label movement when a shape is resized (`Label Movement on Shape Resize`). This function should be inspected and potentially modified to ensure that labels are correctly moved when their associated shape is resized.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `LayoutConnectionBehavior` function handles the layout of connections and their waypoints but does not specifically address the movement of labels or associations during a resize operation.

#### `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
function: ResizeBehavior
```

The `ResizeBehavior` function is relevant because it enforces resize constraints and rules for different types of BPMN elements. It listens to the `resize.start` event and sets specific resize constraints. However, it does not explicitly handle the movement of labels or associations. This function should be inspected to determine if it needs to be extended to include logic for moving labels and associations during a resize operation.
