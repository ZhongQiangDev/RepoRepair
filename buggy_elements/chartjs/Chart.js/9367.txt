### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that the LTTB decimation algorithm fails when running on a screen with a 250% scaling factor and an odd width. The error message indicates that the algorithm is trying to access a property 'y' of an undefined object, suggesting that the algorithm is attempting to process data points that do not exist or are out of bounds.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the calculation of indices and ranges within the LTTB algorithm. Specifically, the problem seems to arise from the following lines of code:

```javascript
const avgRangeStart = Math.floor((i + 1) * bucketWidth) + 1 + start;
const avgRangeEnd = Math.min(Math.floor((i + 2) * bucketWidth) + 1, count) + start;
const avgRangeLength = avgRangeEnd - avgRangeStart;
```

When the screen scaling is 250% and the width is odd, the calculations for `avgRangeStart` and `avgRangeEnd` may result in values that are out of bounds or lead to a negative `avgRangeLength`. This can cause the loop that calculates the average `x` and `y` values to access indices that are not valid, leading to the `Cannot read property 'y' of undefined` error.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

src/plugins/plugin.decimation.js
function: lttbDecimation
function: function_7
function: function_6
function: function_3
function: cleanDecimatedDataset
```

The `lttbDecimation` function is directly related to the LTTB algorithm and is likely where the issue occurs. The `function_7`, `function_6`, and `function_3` functions are also relevant as they manage the decimation process and may influence the behavior of the LTTB algorithm. The `cleanDecimatedDataset` function is relevant for cleaning up decimated data, which may be necessary after fixing the issue.
