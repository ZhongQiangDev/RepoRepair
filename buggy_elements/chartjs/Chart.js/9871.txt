### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in a Polar Area chart with a single data item, only the vertical line (leading edge) of the arc is responsive to mouseover events, and the rest of the arc is not clickable nor does it show a tooltip. This makes the chart unusable for users who expect the entire arc to be interactive.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the arc's interactive area is defined in the chart. When there is only one data item, the arc fills the entire circle, but the interactive area might only be defined along the leading edge of the arc. This could be due to how the arc's hit detection or interaction logic is implemented, possibly not accounting for the case where the arc spans the entire circle.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.polarArea.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.polarArea.js
class: PolarAreaController
function: onClick
function: label
```
The `PolarAreaController` class manages the rendering and interaction of the Polar Area chart. The `onClick` function handles click events on the chart, and the `label` function generates labels for tooltips. These functions may need to be adjusted to ensure the entire arc is interactive.

#### --- src/core/core.datasetController.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are more general and do not seem directly related to the specific issue with the Polar Area chart's interaction.

#### --- src/core/core.interaction.js ---
```
src/core/core.interaction.js
function: dataset
function: getNearestItems
function: getAxisItems
```
The `dataset`, `getNearestItems`, and `getAxisItems` functions are involved in determining which chart elements are interacted with based on user input. These functions may need to be adjusted to ensure the entire arc is considered interactive.

#### --- src/elements/element.arc.js ---
```
src/elements/element.arc.js
class: ArcElement
function: inRange
function: tooltipPosition
```
The `ArcElement` class represents the arc in the chart, and the `inRange` function determines if a point is within the arc's boundaries. The `tooltipPosition` function calculates the position for tooltips. These functions are crucial for ensuring the entire arc is interactive.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js ---
```
src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js
function: afterEvent
function: createTooltipItem
function: label
```
The `afterEvent` function handles events related to tooltips, `createTooltipItem` creates tooltip items, and the `label` function generates labels for tooltips. These functions may need to be adjusted to ensure tooltips are displayed correctly for the entire arc.
