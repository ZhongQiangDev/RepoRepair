### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the border thickness of the chart has increased since version 3.5.0, making it bolder than in version 3.4.1. This change affects the chart's border but not the legend's border. The user wants to reduce the border thickness without affecting the legend's border.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from changes in how the `borderWidth` property is applied to the chart's border in version 3.5.0. The `borderWidth` property may now be affecting the chart's border more globally, leading to the thicker appearance. The user's attempt to adjust `borderWidth` affects both the chart and legend borders, which suggests a need for more granular control over the border properties.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/scripts/analyzer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/controllers/controller.bar.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
class: BarController
```
The `BarController` class is responsible for managing bar chart functionalities, including border properties. It may contain logic related to the border thickness issue.

#### --- src/core/core.defaults.js ---
```
src/core/core.defaults.js
class: Defaults
```
The `Defaults` class manages default configurations for chart properties, including `borderWidth`. Changes in this class could affect the default border thickness.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/elements/element.bar.js ---
```
src/elements/element.bar.js
function: parseBorderWidth
function: parseBorderRadius
function: parseBorderSkipped
class: BarElement
```
The `parseBorderWidth`, `parseBorderRadius`, and `parseBorderSkipped` functions, along with the `BarElement` class, are directly involved in calculating and applying border properties to bar elements. These functions may need adjustments to control the border thickness more precisely.
