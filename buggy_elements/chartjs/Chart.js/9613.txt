### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after upgrading from Chart.js v2.9.4 to v3.5.1, the tooltip does not show when the user touches any part of the graph using `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events. The tooltip only hovers but does not display as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is related to event normalization in Chart.js v3.5.1. In v3, the event types are normalized, meaning that `pointerdown` and `pointerup` events are converted to `mousedown` and `mouseup` events internally. However, the plugin event filters still use the original event types (`pointerdown` and `pointerup`), which do not match the normalized event types. As a result, the tooltip does not trigger as expected.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/scripts/analyzer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/core.controller.js ---
```
src/core/core.controller.js
class: Chart
```

The `chart` class creates and manages a customizable chart instance with interactive features, animations, and plugin support, which is relevant for handling event.

#### --- src/core/core.interaction.js ---
```
src/core/core.interaction.js
function: getRelativePosition
function: fromNativeEvent
```

The `getRelativePosition` function calculates the relative position of an event within the chart, which is relevant for determining where tooltips should appear. The `fromNativeEvent` function normalizes the event type, which is directly related to the issue described.

#### --- src/platform/platform.dom.js ---
```
src/platform/platform.dom.js
function: fromNativeEvent
```

The `fromNativeEvent` function is responsible for normalizing the event type, which is the core of the issue. It converts the original event type to a normalized type, which does not match the event types used in the plugin filters.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js ---
```
src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js
function: afterEvent
function: createTooltipItem
function: determineAlignment
```

The `afterEvent` function processes events related to tooltips, and the `createTooltipItem` function creates tooltip items based on the event. The `determineAlignment` function determines the alignment of the tooltip, which is indirectly related to the event handling process. These functions are relevant to the tooltip behavior and event handling.
