### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that stacked line charts in Chart.js always begin at zero on the y-axis, even when the `beginAtZero` option is set to `false`. This behavior is incorrect because it does not take into account the stacking of data points when calculating the minimum y-axis tick.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the y-axis scale is configured and how the minimum value for the y-axis is determined when stacking is enabled. When stacking is enabled, the minimum value of the y-axis should be calculated based on the stacked data points rather than starting from zero. The problem might be in the logic that calculates the y-axis range or in the way the stacked data is processed.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.line.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.line.js
function: getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints
class: LineController
```
The `LineController` class and the `getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints` function are relevant because they manage the rendering and updating of line chart datasets. However, they do not directly handle the y-axis scale configuration or the calculation of the y-axis range.

#### --- src/core/core.datasetController.js ---
```
src/core/core.datasetController.js
function: applyStack
class: DatasetController
function: updateStacks
function: isStacked
```
The `applyStack`, `updateStacks`, `isStacked` functions and `DatasetController` class are relevant because they handle the stacking of datasets. The `applyStack` function processes the stacked values, `updateStacks` updates the stack values for each data point, `isStacked` checks if a scale is stacked and `DatasetController` manages and controls the data and rendering of a specific dataset within a chart. These functions and classes are crucial for ensuring that the stacking logic is correctly applied.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---
```
src/core/core.scale.js
function: getUserBounds
function: getPixelForGridLine
```
The `getUserBounds` function is relevant because it retrieves the minimum and maximum values defined by the user for the scale. The `getPixelForGridLine` function calculates the pixel position for grid lines, which is related to the y-axis tick positions. These functions may need to be adjusted to correctly handle stacked data.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---
```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
class: LinearScale
```
The `LinearScale` class is relevant because it provides methods to determine data limits, compute tick limits, and convert between data values and pixel positions. The `determineDataLimits` method calculates the minimum and maximum values of the data, which should take stacking into account.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linearbase.js ---
```
src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
class: LinearScaleBase
function: generateTicks
function: handleTickRangeOptions
```
The `LinearScaleBase` class and the `generateTicks` and `handleTickRangeOptions` functions are relevant because they handle the generation of ticks and the adjustment of the minimum and maximum values of the scale. The `handleTickRangeOptions` function adjusts the scale range based on options like `beginAtZero`, which needs to be correctly applied when stacking is enabled.
