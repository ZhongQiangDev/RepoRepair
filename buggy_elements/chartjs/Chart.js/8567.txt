### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the y-axis labels in the bar chart are overlapping after upgrading from Chart.js version 2.7.3 to 2.9.3. In version 2.7.3, the labels are properly spaced and do not overlap, but in version 2.9.3, they are overlapping, making the chart difficult to read.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the overlapping y-axis labels is likely related to changes in how the y-axis tick labels are calculated and positioned in version 2.9.3. This could involve changes in the spacing, font size, or the logic that determines the number of ticks and their positions on the y-axis. The issue might be due to a bug or an unintended change in the tick generation or spacing algorithm.

### Explanation

- **src/core/core.scale.js**: The `calculateSpacing` function is responsible for determining the spacing between ticks, which could affect label overlap. The `getTickMarkLength` function determines the length of tick marks, which might influence label placement. The `getPixelForGridLine` function calculates the pixel position for grid lines, which could impact label positioning. The `getScaleLabelHeight` function calculates the height of scale labels, which is crucial for preventing overlap. The `Scale` class manages the overall scale, including tick generation and label rendering.

- **src/core/core.ticks.js**: The `numeric` function formats numeric tick values, which could affect how labels are displayed and spaced.

- **src/scales/scale.linear.js**: The `LinearScale` class handles linear scales, including determining data limits and computing tick limits, which are essential for proper label placement and spacing.
