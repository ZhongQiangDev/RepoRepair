### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the bars in the bar chart do not have 100% width as expected when `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` are set to 1. Instead, there are empty spaces or borders between the bars, and the spacing is inconsistent.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the bar widths and positions are calculated and rendered. Even though `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` are set to 1, the bars are not filling the entire available space. This could be due to incorrect calculations in the functions responsible for determining the bar sizes and positions, or improper handling of the `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` options.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.bar.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
function: computeFitCategoryTraits
function: computeFlexCategoryTraits
class: BarController
```

The `computeFitCategoryTraits` and `computeFlexCategoryTraits` functions are responsible for calculating the size and position of the bars based on the `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` options. The `BarController` class manages the overall rendering and configuration of the bar chart, so it is also relevant.

#### --- src/elements/element.bar.js ---
```
src/elements/element.bar.js
function: boundingRects
function: getBarBounds
function: inflateRect
class: BarElement
```

The `boundingRects` and `getBarBounds` functions are involved in calculating the dimensions and positions of the bars, which could affect the spacing. The `inflateRect` function adjusts the size of the bars, and the `BarElement` class manages the rendering of individual bars.
