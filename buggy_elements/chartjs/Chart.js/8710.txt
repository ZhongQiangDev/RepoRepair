### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the scatter chart is throwing a `RangeError` when rendering the graph. The error message indicates that the `minimumFractionDigits` value is out of range, which suggests an issue with the formatting of numeric values for the chart's ticks.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the error appears to be related to the `locale` being undefined when calling the `formatNumber` function. The `locale` is used to determine the formatting rules for numbers, and if it is undefined, the `formatNumber` function may not work correctly, leading to the `RangeError`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- samples/utils.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/core/core.config.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/core/core.ticks.js ---
```
src/core/core.ticks.js
function: numeric
```
The `numeric` function is directly involved in formatting tick values for the chart. It uses the `locale` from `this.chart.options.locale` to format the tick values. If `locale` is undefined, this could lead to the `RangeError`.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.intl.js ---
```
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
function: formatNumber
function: getNumberFormat
```
The `formatNumber` function is responsible for formatting numbers according to the specified locale and options. If `locale` is undefined, this function will not work correctly, leading to the `RangeError`. The `getNumberFormat` function is used by `formatNumber` to create an `Intl.NumberFormat` instance, which also depends on the `locale`.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
