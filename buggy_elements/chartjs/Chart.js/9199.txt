### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when `rtl: true` is set in the legend configuration, the text in the legend does not render correctly. Specifically, the text goes off-screen or is not rendered at all. This is contrary to the expected behavior where the text should be rendered right-to-left (RTL) with the box to the right of the text, similar to how it was handled in Chart.js v2.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the changes in the RTL handling logic between Chart.js v2 and v3. The `_textX` calculation may not be RTL-aware, leading to incorrect positioning of the text. Additionally, the `renderText` function may not be properly handling RTL text alignment and positioning, causing the text to go off-screen or not render at all.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js ---
```
src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js
function: getRtlAdapter
function: overrideTextDirection
function: restoreTextDirection
```

The `getRtlAdapter` function is crucial for creating an adapter that handles RTL transformations. The `overrideTextDirection` and `restoreTextDirection` functions manage the text direction of the canvas context, which is essential for ensuring that the text is rendered correctly in an RTL context.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.legend.js ---
```
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
class: Legend
function: generateLabels
function: calculateItemWidth
function: calculateItemHeight
```

The `Legend` class manages the legend's rendering and layout, including the positioning of legend items. The `generateLabels` function creates the labels for the legend, and the `calculateItemWidth` and `calculateItemHeight` functions determine the dimensions of the legend items, which are important for correct RTL rendering.

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- types/helpers/helpers.rtl.d.ts ---
```
types/helpers/helpers.rtl.d.ts
function: RTLAdapter
```

The `RTLAdapter` interface defines the methods necessary for adjusting layout elements in an RTL context, which is relevant for ensuring that the legend items are correctly positioned and aligned in an RTL layout.
