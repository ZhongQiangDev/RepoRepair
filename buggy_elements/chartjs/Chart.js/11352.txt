### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when clicking on a multi-line label in the legend of a chart, the action (such as hiding or showing the corresponding dataset) is applied to the wrong label. Specifically, it affects the label above the one clicked, and the issue worsens with more labels.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the legend items are positioned and how click events are mapped to these items. When the legend is positioned on the right and labels are multi-line, the click event might be incorrectly mapped due to incorrect calculation of the hit boxes or bounding boxes for the legend items. This could be due to incorrect height calculations for multi-line labels or incorrect alignment of the hit boxes with the visual labels.

function: onClick
function: _getLegendItemAt
class: Legend
```

The `onClick` function handles the click event on a legend item and toggles the visibility of the corresponding dataset. The `_getLegendItemAt` function determines which legend item was clicked based on the coordinates. The `Legend` class manages the legend's layout and interaction, including the positioning of legend items and their hit boxes.
