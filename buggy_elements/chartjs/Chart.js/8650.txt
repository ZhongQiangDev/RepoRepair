### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the rightmost data point in the line chart is getting cropped off, meaning it is not fully visible within the chart area. However, the tooltip for this data point is displayed correctly, indicating that the data point exists but is not being rendered properly within the chart's boundaries.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the chart's dimensions are calculated and how the data points are positioned within the chart area. Specifically, the chart's layout system might not be accounting for the space required to display the rightmost data point, causing it to be cropped off. This could be due to incorrect padding, margin calculations, or the way the chart's width is being determined.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/controllers/controller.line.js`

```
src/controllers/controller.line.js
function: getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints
class: LineController
```

The `getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints` function calculates the visible range of data points based on the scale's bounds. If the calculation of the visible range does not account for the space needed for the rightmost data point, it could lead to the cropping issue. The `LineController` class manages the rendering and updating of line charts, so it is relevant to the problem.

#### `src/core/core.layouts.js`

```
src/core/core.layouts.js
function: update
function: fitBoxes
function: placeBoxes
```

The `update` function is responsible for updating the chart's layout, including fitting and placing boxes within the chart area. If the layout calculations do not properly account for the space needed for the rightmost data point, it could cause the cropping issue. The `fitBoxes` and `placeBoxes` functions are involved in fitting and positioning layout elements, which could also contribute to the problem.

#### `src/core/core.scale.js`

```
src/core/core.scale.js
function: getPixelForGridLine
function: getTickMarkLength
```

The `getPixelForGridLine` function calculates the pixel position for grid lines, which includes the rightmost data point. If this calculation is incorrect, it could lead to the data point being cropped off. The `getTickMarkLength` function determines the length of tick marks, which could also affect the positioning of the data points.

#### `src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are related to canvas operations like clearing, clipping, and drawing points, but they do not directly affect the layout or positioning of data points within the chart area.

#### `types/index.esm.d.ts`

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

This file contains type definitions and does not include any functions or classes that directly affect the chart's layout or data point positioning. 

### Summary

The relevant files and functions/classes that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

1. `src/controllers/controller.line.js`: `getStartAndCountOfVisiblePoints`, `LineController`
2. `src/core/core.layouts.js`: `update`, `fitBoxes`, `placeBoxes`
3. `src/core/core.scale.js`: `getPixelForGridLine`, `getTickMarkLength`
