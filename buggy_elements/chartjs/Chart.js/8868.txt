### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the first and last horizontal labels on the custom scale are getting cut off. This issue is specific to the horizontal labels on the custom scale, while the vertical labels are not experiencing the same problem.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the label cutoff likely involves how the horizontal labels are positioned and rendered relative to the chart area. The issue could be due to incorrect calculations of the label positions, insufficient padding or margins, or improper handling of the label dimensions when they are placed near the edges of the chart.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/scripts/analyzer.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---
```
src/core/core.layouts.js
function: fitBoxes
function: placeBoxes
function: update
function: updateDims
function: getMargins
```

The `fitBoxes`, `placeBoxes`, `update`, `updateDims`, and `getMargins` functions are relevant because they handle the layout and positioning of elements within the chart, including the calculation of margins and dimensions that could affect label placement.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.autoskip.js ---
```
src/core/core.scale.autoskip.js
function: autoSkip
function: calculateSpacing
function: skip
function: skipMajors
function: determineMaxTicks
```

The `autoSkip`, `calculateSpacing`, `skip`, `skipMajors`, and `determineMaxTicks` functions are relevant because they manage the display of ticks and labels, including the spacing and skipping of labels to prevent overlap, which could be related to the cutoff issue.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---
```
src/core/core.scale.js
function: getPixelForGridLine
function: getTickMarkLength
function: getTitleHeight
function: sample
class: Scale
```

The `getPixelForGridLine`, `getTickMarkLength`, `getTitleHeight`, `sample`, and `Scale` class are relevant because they handle the pixel calculations for grid lines, tick marks, title heights, and general scale operations, which could influence label positioning.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---
```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
class: LinearScale
```

The `LinearScale` class is relevant because it extends the base scale functionality and could contain specific implementations that affect the positioning and rendering of horizontal labels.

### Summary

The identified functions and classes are likely involved in the label cutoff issue. The `fitBoxes`, `placeBoxes`, `update`, `updateDims`, and `getMargins` functions in `core.layouts.js` handle layout and positioning. The `autoSkip`, `calculateSpacing`, `skip`, `skipMajors`, and `determineMaxTicks` functions in `core.scale.autoskip.js` manage label display and spacing. The `getPixelForGridLine`, `getTickMarkLength`, `getTitleHeight`, `sample`, and `Scale` class in `core.scale.js` handle pixel calculations and general scale operations. Finally, the `LinearScale` class in `scale.linear.js` could contain specific implementations affecting horizontal labels.
