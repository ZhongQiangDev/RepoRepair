### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the legend and title are rendered twice in the pie chart when using Chart.js v3.0.0-beta.7. This issue does not occur with the LINE chart, indicating that it is specific to the pie chart implementation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely lies in how the pie chart's legend and title are being updated or rendered. The problem might be related to the following:

- **Redundant Updates**: The legend and title might be updated or rendered more than once during the chart's lifecycle.
- **Animation Issues**: There could be an issue with the animation logic that causes the legend and title to be redrawn.
- **Configuration Conflicts**: There might be conflicting configurations or settings that lead to the legend and title being rendered twice.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.pie.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.pie.js
class: PieController
```
The `PieController` class is responsible for rendering pie charts. Since the issue is specific to pie charts, this class is likely involved in the problem. The class might have methods or configurations that cause the legend and title to be rendered twice.

#### --- src/core/core.animations.js ---
```
src/core/core.animations.js
function: awaitAll
function: resolveTargetOptions
```
The `awaitAll` function manages animations, which could be related to the issue if the legend and title are being animated and redrawn. The `resolveTargetOptions` function updates options for the target object, which might be involved if there are conflicting options causing the issue.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.legend.js ---
```
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
function: afterUpdate
function: beforeUpdate
class: Legend
```
The `Legend` class and the `afterUpdate` and `beforeUpdate` functions are directly related to the legend's rendering and updating. These functions might be causing the legend to be rendered twice.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.title.js ---
```
src/plugins/plugin.title.js
function: beforeUpdate
function: createTitle
class: Title
```
The `Title` class and the `beforeUpdate` and `createTitle` functions are responsible for the title's rendering and updating. These functions might be causing the title to be rendered twice.
