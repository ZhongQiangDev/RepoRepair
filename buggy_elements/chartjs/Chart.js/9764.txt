### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the `hoverRadius` is set to `0`, the bubble disappears on hover, and when the `hoverRadius` is set to the same value as the `radius`, the bubble gets bigger. According to the expected behavior, setting `hoverRadius` to `0` should result in the bubble maintaining the same size whether hovered or not.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `hoverRadius` is being applied or calculated when the bubble is hovered. The `hoverRadius` should be an additional radius added to the base `radius` when hovered. If `hoverRadius` is `0`, the bubble should not change size. If `hoverRadius` is equal to the `radius`, the bubble should double in size, but the current behavior suggests an incorrect calculation or application of the `hoverRadius`.

#### --- docs/scripts/derived-bubble.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/controllers/controller.bubble.js ---
```
src/controllers/controller.bubble.js
class: BubbleController
```
The `BubbleController` class is responsible for handling the data and rendering logic specific to bubble charts. The issue might be related to how the `hoverRadius` is being applied in the `updateElements` method or the `resolveDataElementOptions` method.

#### --- src/core/core.element.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/elements/element.point.js ---
```
src/elements/element.point.js
class: PointElement
```
The `PointElement` class manages a point in a graphical environment and includes methods for handling user interactions. The `inRange` method and the `draw` method might be relevant to how the bubble's size is calculated and rendered.

#### --- src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
