### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that a `RangeError` is being thrown when creating a specific chart. The error message indicates that the `minimumFractionDigits` value is out of range, which suggests that the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor is being called with invalid parameters.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the error appears to be related to the `getNumberFormat` function in `helpers.intl.js`. The error occurs because the `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` options are being set to `NaN` or `null`, which are invalid values for these parameters. This results in the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor throwing a `RangeError`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/core/core.controller.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/core/core.defaults.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/core/core.ticks.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.intl.js ---
```
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
function: getNumberFormat
function: formatNumber
```

The `getNumberFormat` function is where the error occurs. It is responsible for creating an `Intl.NumberFormat` instance, and it appears that the `options` parameter is being passed with invalid values for `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits`.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---
```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
class: LinearScale
```

The `LinearScale` class is relevant because it uses the `numeric` function from `core.ticks.js`, which in turn calls `formatNumber` from `helpers.intl.js`. This means that the `LinearScale` class is indirectly involved in the error.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
function: getNumberFormat
function: formatNumber
```
2. ```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
class: LinearScale
```

These locations need to be inspected and potentially edited to fix the problem. Specifically, the `getNumberFormat` function should be modified to ensure that `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` are valid numbers before creating the `Intl.NumberFormat` instance. Additionally, the `LinearScale` class should be checked to ensure that it is not passing invalid values to the `numeric` function.
