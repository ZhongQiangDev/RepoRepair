### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates a feature proposal to add border radius settings to the Bar chart. The wrong behavior here is that the current implementation of the Bar chart does not support border radius settings, which limits the customization options for users.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the current implementation of the Bar chart does not include any logic or configuration options for setting border radius. This means that the `BarElement` class, which is responsible for rendering the bars, does not have the necessary properties or methods to handle border radius. Additionally, the configuration options for the chart do not include a setting for border radius.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `samples/samples.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is primarily about setting up examples and categories for different chart types and does not directly relate to the rendering or configuration of the Bar chart.

#### `src/controllers/controller.bar.js`
```
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
class: BarController
```
The `BarController` class is responsible for managing the bar chart's data and rendering logic. While it does not directly handle the border radius, it may need to be updated to pass the border radius configuration to the `BarElement` class.

#### `src/core/core.config.js`
```
src/core/core.config.js
class: Config
```
The `Config` class manages the configuration settings for the chart. To support border radius, the configuration options need to be updated to include a setting for border radius.

#### `src/core/core.defaults.js`
```
src/core/core.defaults.js
class: Defaults
```
The `Defaults` class defines the default configurations for the chart. Adding a default setting for border radius would be necessary to ensure that the feature is available even without explicit configuration.

#### `src/elements/element.bar.js`
```
src/elements/element.bar.js
class: BarElement
function: boundingRects
function: draw
```
The `BarElement` class is responsible for rendering the bars. To support border radius, the `draw` method needs to be updated to handle the border radius when rendering the bars. The `boundingRects` function may also need to be adjusted to account for the border radius when calculating the bar's dimensions.
