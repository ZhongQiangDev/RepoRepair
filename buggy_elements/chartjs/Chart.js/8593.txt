### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the radar chart is not rotating as expected. The user wants to rotate the radar chart by a specific angle (1.22 * Math.PI), but the chart remains fixed at the default rotation angle (-0.5 * Math.PI).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the rotation angle is hardcoded or not being updated correctly within the radar chart's rendering logic. The rotation angle needs to be configurable and applied to the chart's rendering process, particularly when calculating the positions of the points and labels.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.radar.js ---
This file contains the `RadarController` class, which is responsible for managing radar chart datasets. The rotation issue is likely related to how the points and labels are positioned within this class.

```
src/controllers/controller.radar.js
class: RadarController
```

#### --- src/core/core.animator.js ---
This file contains the `Animator` class, which handles animations for charts. While animations are important, the rotation issue seems more related to the initial positioning of the chart elements rather than the animation process.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js ---
This file contains various helper functions for canvas operations. While these functions are used for drawing and manipulating the canvas, they do not directly handle the rotation of the radar chart.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.math.js ---
This file contains mathematical helper functions. The `getAngleFromPoint` and `_normalizeAngle` functions might be relevant if they are used to calculate angles for the radar chart's points and labels.

```
src/helpers/helpers.math.js
function: getAngleFromPoint
function: _normalizeAngle
```

#### --- src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js ---
This file contains the `RadialLinearScale` class, which handles the radial scale for the radar chart. The rotation issue is likely related to how the angles are calculated and applied within this class.

```
src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js
class: RadialLinearScale
function: getIndexAngle
function: getPointPosition
function: getPointPositionForValue
```
