### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the xAxis is enabled, it introduces padding on the left and right sides of the chart to accommodate the tick labels. This padding causes the chart to no longer display edge-to-edge, which is the desired behavior when the xAxis is hidden. The user requests an option to render the tick labels inside the chart bounds, so that the chart can still display edge-to-edge even when the xAxis is visible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely related to how the chart calculates and applies padding for the tick labels. When the xAxis is enabled, the chart automatically adds padding to ensure that the tick labels are fully visible and do not overlap with the chart area. This padding is applied to the left and right sides of the chart, which results in the chart not displaying edge-to-edge.

To fix this, the chart needs an option to render the tick labels inside the chart bounds, which would eliminate the need for additional padding on the left and right sides. This would allow the chart to display edge-to-edge even when the xAxis is visible.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/core/core.interaction.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---
```
src/core/core.layouts.js
function: fitBoxes
function: placeBoxes
function: update
```

The `fitBoxes`, `placeBoxes`, and `update` functions are relevant because they handle the layout and positioning of chart elements, including the calculation of padding and the placement of tick labels. These functions may need to be modified to support rendering tick labels inside the chart bounds.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.defaults.js ---
```
src/core/core.scale.defaults.js
function: applyScaleDefaults
```

The `applyScaleDefaults` function is relevant because it sets default configurations for chart scales, including tick settings. This function may need to be updated to include a new option for rendering tick labels inside the chart bounds.

#### --- src/core/core.scale.js ---
```
src/core/core.scale.js
class: Scale
function: getPixelForGridLine
function: getTickMarkLength
```

The `Scale` class and the `getPixelForGridLine` and `getTickMarkLength` functions are relevant because they handle the positioning and rendering of grid lines and tick marks. These functions may need to be modified to support rendering tick labels inside the chart bounds.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---
```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
class: LinearScale
```

The `LinearScale` class is relevant because it provides methods for determining data limits, computing tick limits, and converting between data values and pixel positions. This class may need to be extended to support rendering tick labels inside the chart bounds.
