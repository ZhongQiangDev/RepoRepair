### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is a `TypeError: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined` when setting the `defaults.layout.padding` in Chart.js version v3.0.0-rc.2. This error occurs during the rendering of a scatter chart, specifically when the chart tries to access a property that is not defined, leading to a crash.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error message suggests that somewhere in the code, an attempt is made to access the `value` property of an undefined object. Given the context of setting `defaults.layout.padding`, it's likely that the issue arises from how the padding values are being processed or applied within the chart's layout system.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/controllers/controller.scatter.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/core/core.defaults.js ---
```
src/core/core.defaults.js
class: Defaults
```
The `Defaults` class is responsible for managing default configurations for the chart, including padding settings. The issue might be related to how padding defaults are set or accessed within this class.

#### --- src/core/core.layouts.js ---
```
src/core/core.layouts.js
function: getMargins
function: handleMaxPadding
function: update
function: updateDims
function: updateMaxPadding
```
These functions are involved in calculating and updating the margins, padding, and dimensions of the chart layout. The error could be occurring in one of these functions if they are not correctly handling the padding values.

#### --- src/helpers/helpers.options.js ---
```
src/helpers/helpers.options.js
function: toPadding
function: toTRBL
```
The `toPadding` and `toTRBL` functions are responsible for converting padding values into the appropriate format. If these functions are not correctly handling the padding values, it could lead to the error.

#### --- src/scales/scale.linear.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
