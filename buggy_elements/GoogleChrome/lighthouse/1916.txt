### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `OffscreenImages` audit is flagging an SVG file with a debug string indicating "Invalid image sizing information." This suggests that the audit is incorrectly identifying the SVG as having an issue with its size, even though SVGs are vector graphics and do not have a fixed pixel size like raster images.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from the fact that the `OffscreenImages` audit is not properly handling SVG files. SVGs are vector graphics that scale infinitely without losing quality and do not have a fixed pixel size like raster images (e.g., JPEG, PNG). Therefore, the audit's logic for calculating visible pixels and wasted bytes may not be applicable or correctly implemented for SVGs.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js
class: OffscreenImages
```

The `OffscreenImages` class is directly related to the issue described. The audit logic within this class needs to be inspected to ensure it correctly handles SVG files. Specifically, the methods `computeVisiblePixels`, `computeWaste`, and `audit_` should be examined to see if they appropriately account for the nature of SVGs.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js
class: UsesResponsiveImages
```

Although this class is not directly related to the `OffscreenImages` audit, it does handle image resources and includes logic for ignoring SVG images. This suggests that similar logic might need to be incorporated into the `OffscreenImages` audit to properly handle SVGs.
