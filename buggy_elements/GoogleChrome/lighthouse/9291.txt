### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the i18n text is not being translated when a fatal CLI run occurs. Specifically, the error message displayed is not localized, indicating an issue with the internationalization (i18n) process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the error messages are being handled and formatted. When a fatal error occurs, the error message should be localized according to the specified locale. However, the error message displayed is not translated, suggesting that the localization process is not being applied correctly during error handling.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-cli/run.js

This file contains several functions related to error handling and the execution of Lighthouse audits. The following functions are relevant to the issue:

```
lighthouse-cli/run.js
function: handleError
function: printErrorAndExit
function: printRuntimeErrorAndExit
function: runLighthouse
```

- `handleError`: This function dispatches errors to specific error-handling functions based on the error code. It should ensure that error messages are localized.
- `printErrorAndExit`, `printRuntimeErrorAndExit`: These functions log error messages and exit the process. They should ensure that the error messages are localized.
- `runLighthouse`: This function handles the overall execution of the Lighthouse audit and manages error handling. It should ensure that any errors are properly localized before being displayed.

#### lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/metric.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/proto-preprocessor.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js

This file contains several functions related to internationalization. The following functions are relevant to the issue:

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
function: getFormatted
function: getFormattedFromIdAndValues
function: replaceIcuMessageInstanceIds
function: _resolveIcuMessageInstanceId
```

- `getFormatted`: This function checks if the input is an ICU message and resolves it to a formatted string using the provided locale.
- `getFormattedFromIdAndValues`: This function formats an ICU message ID with the provided values and locale.
- `replaceIcuMessageInstanceIds`: This function replaces ICU message IDs with their localized values in the Lighthouse Result object.
- `_resolveIcuMessageInstanceId`: This function resolves an ICU message instance ID to a formatted string using the provided locale.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js

This file contains the `swapLocale` function, which is relevant to the issue:

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js
function: swapLocale
```

- `swapLocale`: This function updates the locale of the Lighthouse Result object and formats messages in the new locale. It should ensure that all messages, including error messages, are properly localized.

### Summary

The issue likely stems from the error handling functions in `lighthouse-cli/run.js` not properly utilizing the internationalization functions in `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js` and `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js` to localize error messages. The relevant functions and classes have been identified and listed above.
