### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Google PageSpeed is reporting an incorrect size and potential savings for the CSS fetched via a gzipped JSON file. Specifically, it reports a size of 80KB and a potential savings of 70KB, while the actual size of the fetched configuration is only around 20KB when gzipped.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how Lighthouse estimates the transfer size of resources and calculates the potential savings. The `estimateTransferSize` method in the `UnusedBytes` class uses compression ratios based on the resource type, which may not accurately reflect the actual compression achieved by the 3rd party tool. Additionally, the `computeUsage` method in the `UnusedCSSRules` class calculates wasted bytes based on the percentage of unused CSS, which might not consider the actual size of the gzipped JSON file.
