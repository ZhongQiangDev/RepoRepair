### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that Lighthouse reports the start URL does not load offline, but the current page does. Specifically, during the offline pass, the desktop version of the page is loaded, and the `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` flags on all network requests are `false`, which should not be possible when offline.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the way Lighthouse simulates the offline environment and checks the start URL's availability. The desktop version of the page being loaded suggests that the offline simulation might not be correctly enforced, or the start URL check might not be accurately reflecting the offline state. The flags `fromServiceWorker` and `fromDiskCache` being `false` indicate that the resources are not being served from the service worker or cache as expected in an offline scenario.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lighthouse-core/audits/offline-start-url.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/offline-start-url.js
class: OfflineStartUrl
```
The `OfflineStartUrl` class is directly related to evaluating whether the start URL is accessible offline. The issue described could be related to how this class checks the start URL's status code and generates explanations.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/works-offline.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/works-offline.js
class: WorksOffline
```
The `WorksOffline` class evaluates whether the web application can function offline by checking the `Offline` artifact. This class might be relevant if there is an issue with how it determines if the application can work offline.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/offline.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/offline.js
class: Offline
```
The `Offline` class simulates an offline state during a specific phase of page navigation. The issue could be related to how this class sets the browser to an offline state and filters network records.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
class: StartUrl
```
The `StartUrl` class evaluates the start URL to ensure it is available offline. The issue could be related to how this class attempts to fetch the start URL while offline and determines its availability.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
function: goOffline
```
The `goOffline` function sends a command to the driver to simulate offline network conditions. The issue could be related to how this function configures the offline simulation.
