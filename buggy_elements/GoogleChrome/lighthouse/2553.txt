### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description suggests adopting `toLocaleString` for all number outputs to ensure thousands separators and decimal place handling. However, the issue is that not all relevant functions or classes in the provided files are using `toLocaleString` for formatting numbers. This means that numbers may be displayed without proper formatting, leading to inconsistent or less readable outputs.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that certain functions and classes in the provided files are still using other methods for formatting numbers, such as `toFixed`, `Math.round`, or direct string conversion, instead of `toLocaleString`. This results in numbers being displayed without the desired formatting (thousands separators and decimal place handling).

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/content-width.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/handlebar-helpers.js
```
lighthouse-core/report/handlebar-helpers.js
function: function_8
function: formatNumber
function: function_15
```

- `function_8`: Uses `toFixed` for formatting numbers, which does not handle thousands separators.
- `formatNumber`: Already uses `toLocaleString` with the desired options, so it is correctly formatted.
- `function_15`: Uses `toLocaleString` with the desired options, so it is correctly formatted.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
function: formatNumber
```

- `formatNumber`: Uses `toLocaleString` with the desired options, so it is correctly formatted.
