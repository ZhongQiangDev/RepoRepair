### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that user timing marks are showing negative numbers. Specifically, the `mark_features_unveil_start` and `mark_features_loaded_start` marks are showing negative timestamps (`-184.69ms` and `-184.53ms` respectively). This indicates that these marks are being recorded before the `navigationStart` time, which is not expected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the negative timestamps likely stems from how the timestamps are being normalized relative to the `navigationStart` time. If the `navigationStart` time is not being correctly identified or if the timestamps of the user timing marks are being recorded before the `navigationStart` event, this could result in negative values when the timestamps are adjusted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js

This file contains the `filterTrace` function and the `UserTimings` class, both of which are directly related to processing and normalizing user timing events.

- **`filterTrace` function**: This function is responsible for filtering and normalizing user timing events. It initializes flags like `navigationStartTime` and adjusts event timestamps relative to this value. If `navigationStartTime` is not correctly set, it could lead to negative timestamps.
- **`UserTimings` class**: This class performs the audit by processing trace data and generating results. It uses the `filterTrace` function to isolate and normalize user timing events.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js
function: filterTrace
class: UserTimings
```

#### lighthouse-core/formatters/user-timings.js

This file contains the `UserTimings` class, which is responsible for formatting user timing events. While this class formats the events, it does not directly process or normalize the timestamps. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the cause of the negative timestamps.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/gather/computed/speedline.js

This file contains the `Speedline` class, which computes speedline metrics from trace data. This class is not directly related to processing user timing events or normalizing timestamps.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/traces/devtools-timeline-model.js

This file contains the `TimelineModel` class, which processes tracing data and provides various analytical views. While this class is involved in processing trace data, it does not directly handle the normalization of user timing events relative to `navigationStart`.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/traces/tracing-processor.js

This file contains the `TraceProcessor` class and some utility functions. The `TraceProcessor` class is involved in initializing a trace model and analyzing trace data, but it does not directly handle the normalization of user timing events.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The primary locations that need inspection or editing to fix the problem are:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js
function: filterTrace
class: UserTimings
```
