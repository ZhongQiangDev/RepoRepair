### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that code snippets containing markdown characters (`_` and `[]()`) are being incorrectly rendered as markup instead of being displayed as plain text. This results in a distorted appearance of the code snippets.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the markdown parser not properly handling code snippets that contain markdown syntax characters. When a string starts with a backtick (`), it should be treated as a code snippet and not processed for markdown formatting. However, the current implementation seems to be applying markdown formatting rules to these code snippets, leading to the rendering issues.

### Conclusion

None of the provided files contain functions or classes directly related to the markdown rendering issue described in the GitHub problem. The issue likely resides in the markdown parsing or rendering logic, which is not covered by the provided files. To fix the problem, you would need to inspect the markdown parsing and rendering components of the application, ensuring that code snippets are properly escaped or treated as plain text when they start with a backtick (`).
