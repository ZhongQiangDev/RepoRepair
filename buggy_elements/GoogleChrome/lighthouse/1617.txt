### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the audit for the manifest's `short_name` length is reporting a false positive when the `short_name` is missing. Specifically, it reports "Found: 0 chars" and suggests that the `short_name` won't be truncated, even though the `short_name` is not present in the manifest.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the audit handles the absence of the `short_name` property. When the `short_name` is missing, the audit should not report a length of 0 characters and should instead indicate that the `short_name` is missing or not applicable. The current implementation seems to be treating the absence of `short_name` as a valid case with a length of 0, which leads to the false positive.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/runner.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js
class: ManifestShortNameLength
```

The `ManifestShortNameLength` class is directly responsible for the audit logic that checks the length of the `short_name`. The issue likely lies within the `audit` method of this class, where it handles the case when `short_name` is missing.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `ManifestShortName` class checks for the presence of `short_name` or `name`, but it does not handle the length check, so it is not directly relevant to the issue.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/manifest.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The `Manifest` class is responsible for gathering the manifest data but does not perform the audit logic, so it is not directly relevant to the issue.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/manifest-parser.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

The functions in this file are responsible for parsing the manifest data but do not perform the audit logic, so they are not directly relevant to the issue.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The only relevant location is:
