### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when there are 0 passing audits, the report still shows a "View 0 passed items" dropdown. This is unexpected because if there are no passing audits, there should be no dropdown for viewing passed items.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the logic that determines whether to display the "View 0 passed items" dropdown. This logic might not be correctly checking if there are any passing audits before rendering the dropdown. It could be that the dropdown is being rendered regardless of the number of passing audits, or that the condition to hide the dropdown when there are no passing audits is not being met.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lighthouse-core/index.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/aggregator/aggregate.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```

The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the report, including categories, audits, and their respective scores. It is likely that the logic for rendering the "View 0 passed items" dropdown is within this class.

#### lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js

```
lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js
class: LighthouseReportViewer
```

The `LighthouseReportViewer` class is responsible for managing the Lighthouse report viewer interface. It might contain logic related to rendering the report and handling the display of audit results, including the "View 0 passed items" dropdown.
