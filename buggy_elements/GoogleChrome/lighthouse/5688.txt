### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse (LH) does not flag BMP images under the "serve images under next gen formats" audit. Specifically, the BMP image at `https://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~ece533/images/sails.bmp` should be flagged as needing optimization, but it is not.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in the audit logic that determines which image formats should be flagged for optimization. The audit may not be configured to recognize BMP images as a legacy format that should be flagged for conversion to a next-generation format like WebP.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/efficient-animated-content.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `EfficientAnimatedContent` class focuses on optimizing animated GIFs, not BMP images.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `OffscreenImages` class focuses on identifying images that are offscreen or hidden, not on optimizing image formats.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-optimized-images.js

This file contains a relevant class. The `UsesOptimizedImages` class is responsible for identifying unoptimized images, which includes BMP images.

```

class: UsesOptimizedImages
```

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `UsesResponsiveImages` class focuses on assessing image responsiveness, not on optimizing image formats.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-webp-images.js

This file contains a relevant class. The `UsesWebPImages` class is responsible for evaluating the potential savings of converting images to WebP format, which is relevant to the issue of serving images in next-generation formats.
