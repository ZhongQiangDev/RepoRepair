### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that warnings within the "Passed Audits" section are not currently visible. The plan is to add a block of warnings following the "Passed Audits" section to ensure these warnings are visible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the current rendering logic not including a section for warnings within the "Passed Audits" category. The rendering logic needs to be updated to include a warnings section after the "Passed Audits" section.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/accessibility/axe-audit.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `AxeAudit` class is responsible for evaluating accessibility compliance and generating audit results, but it does not handle the rendering of the report.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/category-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/category-renderer.js
class: CategoryRenderer
```

The `CategoryRenderer` class is responsible for rendering audit results into a structured report. It includes methods for rendering audits, grouping audits, and creating top-level sections (clumps). To fix the issue, the `_renderGroupedAudits` method or a similar method may need to be updated to include a warnings section after the "Passed Audits" section.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/details-renderer.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `DetailsRenderer` class handles the rendering of specific types of audit details, but it does not handle the overall structure of the report.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```

The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for generating the visual representation of the Lighthouse report. It includes methods for rendering the report header, footer, and categories. The `_renderReport` method orchestrates the rendering process and delegates category rendering to specialized renderers like `CategoryRenderer`. To fix the issue, the `_renderReport` method or a similar method may need to be updated to ensure that the warnings section is included after the "Passed Audits" section.
