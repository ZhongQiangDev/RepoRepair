### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the report currently uses `<img>` tags to hotlink images from a remote server for thumbnails. This leads to Content Security Policy (CSP) and mixed content issues when the report is displayed over HTTPS. The goal is to replace these hotlinked images with full-page screenshots (fpss) to simplify CSP/mixed content handling.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the use of `type=thumbnail` items that create `<img>` tags pointing to remote images. These images are hotlinked, meaning they are loaded directly from a remote server rather than being embedded or served from the same domain as the report. This can cause issues with CSP and mixed content when the report is served over HTTPS, as the browser may block the loading of these images due to security policies.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `flow-report/src/common.tsx`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/screenshot-thumbnails.js`

```
lighthouse-core/audits/screenshot-thumbnails.js
class: ScreenshotThumbnails
```

The `ScreenshotThumbnails` class is responsible for generating thumbnail images from the website's loading process. This class is relevant because it currently generates and uses thumbnail images that may be hotlinked. The audit method in this class may need to be modified to use full-page screenshots instead.

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/full-page-screenshot.js`

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/full-page-screenshot.js
class: FullPageScreenshot
```

The `FullPageScreenshot` class is responsible for capturing a full-page screenshot of a web page. This class is relevant because it can provide the full-page screenshots that should replace the hotlinked thumbnails. The methods in this class may need to be utilized or modified to ensure the screenshots are correctly captured and used.

#### `report/renderer/element-screenshot-renderer.js`

```
report/renderer/element-screenshot-renderer.js
class: ElementScreenshotRenderer
```

The `ElementScreenshotRenderer` class manages the rendering of element screenshots within a full-page screenshot. This class is relevant because it can be used to render the full-page screenshots in place of the hotlinked thumbnails. The methods in this class may need to be adjusted to correctly render the full-page screenshots.

#### `report/renderer/report-renderer.js`

```
report/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```

The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the entire Lighthouse report. This class is relevant because it orchestrates the rendering of the report, including the thumbnails. The `_renderReport` method and other helper methods may need to be modified to use full-page screenshots instead of hotlinked thumbnails.
