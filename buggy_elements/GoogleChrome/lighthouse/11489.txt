### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the 'Transfer size' column in the 'Large JavaScript libraries' view omits the decimal place for round sizes. For example, `18 KiB` is displayed instead of `18.0 KiB`. This makes it harder for users, especially those with vision impairments, to compare the sizes across rows accurately.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the formatting of the numbers in the 'Transfer size' column. The current implementation probably rounds or truncates the decimal places for whole numbers, leading to the omission of the decimal place. To fix this, the formatting logic needs to be adjusted to always display one decimal place, even if it is `0`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/scoring.js

#### lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js

#### lighthouse-core/report/report-generator.js

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/i18n.js
```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/i18n.js
class: I18n
```

The `I18n` class in this file is responsible for formatting numbers, including bytes. The method `formatBytesToKiB` is likely the one used to format the 'Transfer size' column values. To ensure that the decimal place is always displayed, we need to modify this method.
