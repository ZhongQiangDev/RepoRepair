### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves an increase in the error rate on the LR backend, specifically related to latency issues. The `loadPage-defaultPass` timing has seen a significant jump, indicating that the time taken to load the page has increased. This increase in load time is likely causing more sites to hit the 35s `maxWaitForLoad` timeout, which in turn leads to more `NO_FCP` errors and ultimately results in the 60s render timeout being hit more frequently.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to the changes introduced in the commit `https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/6944`, specifically the addition of `waitForFCP` when tracing. This change seems to have introduced additional latency, causing the `loadPage-defaultPass` timing to increase. As a result, more sites are hitting the `maxWaitForLoad` timeout, leading to an increase in `NO_FCP` errors and ultimately causing the 60s render timeout to be hit more frequently.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/runner.js
```
lighthouse-core/runner.js
class: Runner
```
The `Runner` class is responsible for orchestrating the entire Lighthouse auditing process. The `_gatherArtifactsFromBrowser()` method is likely involved in the gathering phase where the `loadPage-defaultPass` timing is measured. This method may need to be inspected to understand how it interacts with the `Driver` class and whether it can be optimized to reduce latency.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
```
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
class: FirstContentfulPaint
```
The `FirstContentfulPaint` class is responsible for measuring the First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric. The `audit` method computes the FCP metric using the provided artifacts and context. Since the issue is related to `NO_FCP` errors, this class may need to be inspected to understand how it handles cases where FCP is not detected within the timeout period.

#### lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
```
lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
class: FirstContentfulPaint
```
The `FirstContentfulPaint` class in this file provides methods for computing the FCP metric in both simulated and observed environments. The `computeSimulatedMetric` and `computeObservedMetric` methods may need to be inspected to understand how they handle timeouts and whether they can be optimized to reduce latency.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js
class: Driver
```
The `Driver` class is responsible for interacting with the browser via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). The `gotoURL` method handles page navigation and may be involved in the `loadPage-defaultPass` timing. This method may need to be inspected to understand how it interacts with the `waitForFCP` logic and whether it can be optimized to reduce latency.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to network and CPU throttling, which are not directly related to the issue of increased latency in the `loadPage-defaultPass` timing. However, the `emulate` function may need to be inspected to ensure that it is not inadvertently introducing additional latency.
