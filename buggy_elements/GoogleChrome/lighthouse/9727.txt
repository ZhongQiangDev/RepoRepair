### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that Lighthouse does not adequately consider the performance of iframes when generating a report for a parent page that includes an iframe. Specifically, the performance score for the parent page (which includes the iframe) is higher than the score for the iframe itself, even though the iframe has significantly worse performance metrics. This discrepancy is misleading and does not accurately reflect the impact of the iframe on the overall page performance.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to how Lighthouse currently handles iframes during its audit process. Lighthouse may not be fully accounting for the performance metrics of iframes when calculating the overall performance score for the parent page. This could be because the iframe's performance data is not being properly aggregated or considered in the final audit results. The iframe's performance metrics, such as First Contentful Paint (FCP), First Meaningful Paint (FMP), Speed Index, and Total Blocking Time (TBT), are not being adequately reflected in the parent page's audit results.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js

```
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
class: FirstContentfulPaint
```

The `FirstContentfulPaint` class is relevant because it calculates the FCP metric, which is one of the key performance indicators that could be affected by the iframe's performance. The class may need to be modified to properly account for the iframe's FCP when calculating the overall FCP for the parent page.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-meaningful-paint.js

```
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-meaningful-paint.js
class: FirstMeaningfulPaint
```

The `FirstMeaningfulPaint` class is relevant because it calculates the FMP metric, which is another key performance indicator that could be affected by the iframe's performance. The class may need to be modified to properly account for the iframe's FMP when calculating the overall FMP for the parent page.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/speed-index.js

```
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/speed-index.js
class: SpeedIndex
```

The `SpeedIndex` class is relevant because it calculates the Speed Index metric, which is a measure of how quickly the content of a page is visibly populated. The class may need to be modified to properly account for the iframe's Speed Index when calculating the overall Speed Index for the parent page.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/total-blocking-time.js

```
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/total-blocking-time.js
class: TotalBlockingTime
```

The `TotalBlockingTime` class is relevant because it calculates the TBT metric, which measures the sum of all blocking time intervals between the FCP and the Time to Interactive (TTI). The class may need to be modified to properly account for the iframe's TBT when calculating the overall TBT for the parent page.
