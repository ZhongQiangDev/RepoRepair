### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the DevTools incorrectly shows "no emulation" for mobile runs. This is likely due to the `getEmulationDescriptions` function returning "no emulation" when `screenEmulation.disabled` is true, which is set for devtools in `devtools-entry.js`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to how the `getEmulationDescriptions` function handles the `screenEmulation.disabled` property. When this property is true, the function returns "no emulation," which is not the desired behavior for mobile runs. This suggests that the logic for determining whether to show "no emulation" might need to be adjusted to account for mobile runs specifically.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `clients/extension/scripts/settings-controller.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `core/lib/emulation.js`

```
core/lib/emulation.js
function: emulate
```

The `emulate` function is relevant because it handles the application of user agent and screen emulation settings to a browser session. It checks if `screenEmulation.disabled` is true and decides whether to apply screen emulation. This function might need to be adjusted to ensure that mobile runs are not incorrectly labeled as "no emulation."

#### `core/lib/rect-helpers.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
