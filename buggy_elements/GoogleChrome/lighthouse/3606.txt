### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Lighthouse audit is erroneously reporting that text-based responses are not compressed, even though gzip compression is enabled and verified via the DevTools Network panel and `curl` command. The audit suggests that compression should be enabled, but the actual response headers indicate that gzip compression is already in use.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the Lighthouse audit checks for compression. The audit might be incorrectly identifying the response as uncompressed, possibly due to a flaw in how it processes the response headers or content. The audit might not be correctly interpreting the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header or might be failing to recognize the compressed content.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `TotalByteWeight` class is focused on evaluating the total byte weight of network resources and does not directly deal with compression checks.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js
class: ResponsesAreCompressed
```

The `ResponsesAreCompressed` class is directly relevant to the issue. This class is responsible for evaluating whether server responses are compressed efficiently. The `audit_` method checks for uncompressed responses and calculates potential savings from compression. If this method incorrectly identifies a compressed response as uncompressed, it would lead to the erroneous report.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/response-compression.js

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/response-compression.js
class: ResponseCompression
```

The `ResponseCompression` class is also relevant. This class analyzes network responses to identify those that are not optimally compressed. The `filterUnoptimizedResponses` method checks if the response headers indicate that the content is already encoded using a compression method. If this method fails to recognize the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header, it could incorrectly flag the response as unoptimized.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `ReportGeneratorV2` class is responsible for generating reports based on audit data but does not directly deal with the compression audit logic.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-ui-features.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The `ReportUIFeatures` class is responsible for enhancing the Lighthouse report with interactive UI features and does not directly deal with the compression audit logic.
