### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that Lighthouse is unable to automatically check the `font-display` value for several font URLs. This results in audit warnings indicating that the `CSSUsage` artifact does not have any stylesheets referencing these fonts.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the inability of Lighthouse to correctly identify and analyze the `@font-face` declarations in the CSS stylesheets. This could be due to several reasons:
- The `@font-face` declarations might not be correctly parsed by the `findFontDisplayDeclarations` method.
- The font URLs might not be correctly matched against the `passingURLs` and `failingURLs` sets.
- The `CSSUsage` artifact might not be capturing all the relevant stylesheets, especially if they are loaded dynamically or through iframes.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/font-display.js

This file contains the `FontDisplay` class, which is directly related to the issue. The `findFontDisplayDeclarations` method is responsible for parsing `@font-face` declarations and categorizing font URLs. The `audit` method performs the main audit by checking font URLs against the parsed declarations.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/font-display.js
class: FontDisplay
```

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/iframe-elements.js

This file contains the `IFrameElements` class and the `collectIFrameElements` function, which are related to collecting information about iframe elements. Since the issue involves iframes, this file might be relevant if the fonts are loaded within iframes.

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/iframe-elements.js
class: IFrameElements
function: collectIFrameElements
```

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/link-elements.js

This file contains the `LinkElements` class and functions related to collecting and normalizing link elements. While this file is related to link elements, it does not directly address the issue of font URLs and `font-display` properties.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
