### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse overestimates the potential savings for minifying JavaScript when it encounters a file with a copyright notice that includes carriage returns and whitespace. Specifically, the file `https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-date-picker-0.1.js` is flagged as unminified, even though the copyright notice cannot be changed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to how Lighthouse calculates the "wasted bytes" for minification. The `computeWaste` method in the `UnminifiedJavaScript` class uses `esprima.tokenize` to parse the script content into tokens and then compares the total token length to the script content length. If the copyright notice contains carriage returns and whitespace, it may be counted as part of the "wasted bytes," leading to an overestimation of the potential savings.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The only relevant location identified is:
```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unminified-javascript.js
class: UnminifiedJavaScript
```

This class contains the logic for identifying unminified JavaScript files and calculating the wasted bytes, which is directly related to the issue described in the GitHub problem description.
