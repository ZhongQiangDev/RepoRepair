### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that adding `rel="noopener"` to `mailto:` links causes them to break on Chrome for Android and iOS Safari. Specifically, the support link fails to launch the email client, while the sales link works fine without the `rel="noopener"` attribute.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because `rel="noopener"` is intended for external links that open in a new tab or window. When applied to `mailto:` links, it interferes with the expected behavior of launching the default email client. This is likely because `mailto:` links are not standard URLs and do not open in a new tab or window like regular links. As a result, the `rel="noopener"` attribute causes the browser to treat the link differently, leading to the observed failure.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/accessibility/link-name.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener.js

```
lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener.js
class: ExternalAnchorsUseRelNoopenerAudit
```

This class is relevant because it checks whether external anchor elements use `rel="noopener"` or `rel="noreferrer"` when they have a `target="_blank"` attribute. The audit should be modified to exclude `mailto:` links from this check.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/html-without-javascript.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/anchors-with-no-rel-noopener.js

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/anchors-with-no-rel-noopener.js
class: AnchorsWithNoRelNoopener
```

This class is relevant because it detects anchor elements that open links in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) but do not include the `rel="noopener"` attribute. The class should be modified to exclude `mailto:` links from this detection.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/seo/crawlable-links.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
