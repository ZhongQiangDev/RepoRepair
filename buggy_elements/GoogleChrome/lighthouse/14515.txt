### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Lighthouse report's meta block does not include the emulated screen dimensions (`width`, `height`) and `deviceScaleFactor` in the tooltip alongside other device-related information like CPU/Memory power.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the current implementation of the Lighthouse report renderer does not include the screen dimensions and `deviceScaleFactor` in the metadata block that is displayed in the tooltip. This information is likely available in the Lighthouse result data but is not being extracted and rendered in the report's metadata section.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- core/lib/emulation.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- report/renderer/report-renderer.js ---
```
report/renderer/report-renderer.js
function: _renderMetaBlock
```
The `_renderMetaBlock` function is responsible for rendering the metadata block in the report's footer. This function needs to be updated to include the screen dimensions and `deviceScaleFactor` in the metadata.

#### --- report/renderer/report-ui-features.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- types/lhr/settings.d.ts ---
```
types/lhr/settings.d.ts
function: ScreenEmulationSettings
```
The `ScreenEmulationSettings` interface defines the structure of the screen emulation settings, including `width`, `height`, and `deviceScaleFactor`. This interface is relevant because it defines the data structure that should be used to include the screen dimensions and `deviceScaleFactor` in the report.
