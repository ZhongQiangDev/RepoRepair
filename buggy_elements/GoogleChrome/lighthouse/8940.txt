### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse is reporting a potential saving of 53 KB for an image (`/spritesheet2.png`) that is already 54 KB in size. This suggests that Lighthouse is either miscalculating the potential savings or incorrectly identifying the image as being significantly larger than it actually is.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause could be one of the following:

- **Incorrect Image Size Calculation**: Lighthouse might be miscalculating the size of the image or the potential savings.
- **Image Optimization Misinterpretation**: The tool might be incorrectly interpreting the optimization potential of the image, possibly due to the image format or content.
- **Audit Logic Flaw**: There might be a flaw in the audit logic that calculates the potential savings, leading to incorrect results.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to image optimization and sizing, not offscreen images.

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-optimized-images.js`

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-optimized-images.js
class: UsesOptimizedImages
```

This class is relevant because it calculates potential savings in bytes when optimizing an image. The `computeSavings` method might be miscalculating the savings.

#### `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is not related to responsive images.

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/image-elements.js`

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/image-elements.js
function: collectImageElementInfo
function: determineNaturalSize
class: ImageElements
```

This file is relevant because it collects information about image elements, including their sizes. The `collectImageElementInfo` function might be incorrectly gathering the image size, and the `determineNaturalSize` function might be incorrectly determining the natural dimensions of the image.

#### `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/optimized-images.js`

```
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/optimized-images.js
function: getOptimizedNumBytes
class: OptimizedImages
```

This file is relevant because it calculates the optimized sizes of images in different formats. The `getOptimizedNumBytes` function might be miscalculating the sizes of the image in JPEG and WebP formats.
