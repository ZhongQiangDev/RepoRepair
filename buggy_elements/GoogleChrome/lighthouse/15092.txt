### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves a runtime error in the Lighthouse performance analysis tool. The error message indicates that the "Required traces gatherer did not run," which results in multiple performance metrics failing to be computed. This issue affects the entire performance analysis, as all metrics under the "Metrics" section and several under the "Opportunities" and "Diagnostics" sections are marked as errors.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the error is likely related to the failure of the trace gatherer to collect the necessary trace data. This could be due to several reasons:
- The trace gatherer might not have been initialized or started correctly.
- There could be an issue with the trace data collection process, such as a failure to start or stop the tracing session.
- The trace data might not have been properly processed or retrieved after collection.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- core/computed/metrics/timing-summary.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to summarizing and computing various performance metrics and timing data, which are not directly related to the trace gatherer issue.

#### --- core/gather/gatherers/trace-compat.js ---
```
core/gather/gatherers/trace-compat.js
class: TraceCompat
```
The `TraceCompat` class is responsible for fetching trace data from the `TraceGatherer`. If there is an issue with fetching the trace data, this class could be a potential cause of the problem. Therefore, this class is relevant to the issue.

#### --- core/gather/gatherers/trace.js ---
```
core/gather/gatherers/trace.js
class: Trace
```
The `Trace` class is responsible for collecting trace events during performance analysis. If there is an issue with starting, stopping, or collecting trace events, this class could be a potential cause of the problem. Therefore, this class is relevant to the issue.

#### --- core/lib/navigation-error.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to identifying and handling navigation errors, which are not directly related to the trace gatherer issue.

#### --- core/lib/tracehouse/trace-processor.js ---
```
core/lib/tracehouse/trace-processor.js
class: TraceProcessor
```
The `TraceProcessor` class is responsible for processing trace events and extracting performance metrics. If the trace data is not available or not properly processed, this class will fail to compute the metrics. Therefore, this class is relevant to the issue.
