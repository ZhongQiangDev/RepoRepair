### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves an extension injecting an `unload` listener into the main frame via a content script that runs in an isolated execution context. This causes the `bfcache` audit to fail because it detects the `unload` handler, but the `no-unload-listeners` audit passes and `getEventListeners(window)` in the console does not show the `unload` listeners. This makes it challenging to debug the issue.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the `unload` listener is added in an isolated execution context by a content script injected by an extension. The `no-unload-listeners` audit and `getEventListeners(window)` only check the main execution context and do not account for listeners in isolated contexts. The `bfcache` audit, however, is able to detect the presence of the `unload` handler, leading to a failure.
