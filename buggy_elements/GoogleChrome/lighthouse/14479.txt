### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the DOM size audit is displaying values with unnecessary decimal places (e.g., `2,008.0` instead of `2,008`). This unnecessary precision is not required since the values will always be integers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to a function or method that is formatting or displaying the values with more precision than necessary. Specifically, the values are being clamped or rounded to two decimal places, even though they should be integers.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- core/audits/dobetterweb/dom-size.js ---
```
core/audits/dobetterweb/dom-size.js
class: DOMSize
```
The `DOMSize` class is responsible for performing the DOM size audit and generating the audit result. It is likely that the issue lies within this class, where the values are being formatted or displayed with unnecessary decimal places.

#### --- core/lib/statistics.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- report/renderer/components.js ---
```
report/renderer/components.js
function: createAuditComponent
```
The `createAuditComponent` function constructs the DOM structure for an audit component, which includes displaying the audit results. It is possible that this function is responsible for formatting the values and could be the source of the unnecessary decimal places.
