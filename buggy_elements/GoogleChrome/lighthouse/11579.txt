### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that Lighthouse fails to measure performance metrics, specifically the First Contentful Paint (FCP), when the tab is in the background. The error message indicates that "Something went wrong with recording the trace over your page load. Please run Lighthouse again. (NO_FCP)." This suggests that the performance metrics are not being recorded correctly when the tab is not in focus.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the way Lighthouse interacts with the browser when the tab is in the background. When a tab is not in focus, the browser may throttle or pause certain activities, such as JavaScript execution and network requests, which can interfere with the performance metrics that Lighthouse is trying to capture. This could result in Lighthouse not being able to accurately record the trace data needed to compute the FCP and other performance metrics.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `lighthouse-core/runner.js`

This file contains the `Runner` class, which is the core orchestrator of a Lighthouse run. It manages the entire lifecycle from setup to result generation, including the gather and audit phases. Given the nature of the issue, the `Runner` class is highly relevant because it is responsible for coordinating the collection of artifacts and running audits, which are directly impacted by the background tab issue.

```
lighthouse-core/runner.js
class: Runner
```

#### `lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js`

This file contains several functions related to network and CPU throttling, as well as device emulation. While these functions are important for setting up the environment in which Lighthouse runs, they do not directly address the issue of recording performance metrics when the tab is in the background. However, the `emulate` function, which applies device emulation settings, could potentially be relevant if the issue is related to how the browser behaves under different emulation conditions.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
function: emulate
```

#### Other Functions in `lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js`

The other functions in this file (`clearAllNetworkEmulation`, `disableCPUThrottling`, `disableNetworkThrottling`, `enableCPUThrottling`, `enableDesktop`, `enableNetworkThrottling`, `enableNexus5X`, `getEmulationDesc`, `goOffline`) do not appear to be directly related to the issue of recording performance metrics when the tab is in the background. They primarily deal with setting up and managing network and CPU throttling, which are not the immediate cause of the problem.
