### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the i18n text is not being translated when a fatal CLI run occurs. Specifically, the error message "Runtime error encountered: lighthouse-core/lib/lh-error.js | urlInvalid # 0" is displayed without proper localization or translation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the fact that the error message is not being properly formatted or translated using the i18n system. This could be due to a few reasons:
- The error message is not being passed through the i18n formatting functions.
- The i18n system is not being initialized or used correctly in the context where the error is being thrown.
- The error message is being constructed in a way that bypasses the i18n system.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lighthouse-cli/run.js ---
This file contains functions that handle errors and manage the Lighthouse run process. The `handleError` function and related error-handling functions (`showPageLoadError`, `showConnectionError`, etc.) are relevant because they are responsible for displaying error messages. However, none of these functions seem to be using the i18n system to format the error messages.

```
lighthouse-cli/run.js
function: handleError
function: showPageLoadError
function: showConnectionError
function: showProtocolTimeoutError
function: showRuntimeError
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/index.js ---
This file contains the main `lighthouse` function that initiates the audit. It does not directly handle error messages or formatting, so it is not directly relevant to the i18n issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/lh-error.js ---
This file contains the `LighthouseError` class, which is used to create error objects. The error messages are defined here, but the formatting or translation of these messages is not handled in this file.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/lh-error.js
class: LighthouseError
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/sentry.js ---
This file contains functions related to error reporting and initialization of Sentry. It does not handle error message formatting or translation.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js ---
This file contains functions related to the i18n system, such as `getFormatted`, `getFormattedFromIdAndValues`, and `replaceIcuMessageInstanceIds`. These functions are responsible for formatting and translating messages, so they are relevant to the issue.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
function: getFormatted
function: getFormattedFromIdAndValues
function: replaceIcuMessageInstanceIds
function: isIcuMessage
function: _resolveIcuMessageInstanceId
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations
