### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the user agent mentioned in the Lighthouse report's runtime settings does not match the actual user agent used in the network requests. This discrepancy is observed in the web server's access logs, where the user agent strings differ from what is reported in the Lighthouse report.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this discrepancy likely lies in how Lighthouse sets up the user agent for the audit. The user agent string reported in the runtime settings might be set during the initialization phase, while the actual user agent used for network requests could be influenced by other factors, such as device emulation settings or network conditions. The inconsistency suggests that the user agent string is not being properly synchronized between the runtime settings and the actual network requests.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### lighthouse-core/runner.js
```
lighthouse-core/runner.js
class: Runner
```
The `Runner` class orchestrates the entire Lighthouse auditing process, including setting up the environment and running audits. It is possible that the user agent settings are being configured or reported within this class.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/gather-runner.js
```
lighthouse-core/gather/gather-runner.js
class: GatherRunner
```
The `GatherRunner` class is responsible for collecting performance metrics and artifacts. It manages the browser setup and network interactions, which could involve setting the user agent for network requests.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
function: emulate
function: enableNexus5X
```
The `emulate` function sets up device emulation, including the user agent string. The `enableNexus5X` function specifically configures the browser to mimic a Nexus 5X device, which includes setting the user agent. These functions are likely relevant to the user agent discrepancy.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js
class: NetworkRequest
```
The `NetworkRequest` class manages network requests and their properties, including the user agent. This class could be where the actual user agent used in network requests is set and tracked.

#### Other Files
