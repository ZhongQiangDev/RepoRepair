### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that inserting `console.log('$');` into `report-renderer.js` causes the JavaScript injection to escape the page. This indicates that the `String.replace` method is being used in a way that allows the `$` character to be interpreted as a special character, leading to unintended behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is likely related to how `String.replace` handles the `$` character. According to the MDN documentation, the `$` character in the replacement string has special meaning and can be used to insert parts of the matched string. If the replacement string contains a `$` character, it can lead to unexpected results, such as injecting additional code into the page.

#### lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-renderer.js
function: render
```

The `render` function in `report-renderer.js` is relevant because it involves manipulating and inserting content into the DOM. If the `String.replace` method is used in this context and the replacement string contains a `$` character, it could lead to the described issue. The `render` function should be inspected to ensure that any use of `String.replace` is safe and does not allow for unintended code injection.
