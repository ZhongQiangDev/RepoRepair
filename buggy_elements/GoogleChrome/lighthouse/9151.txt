### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described in the GitHub problem is related to the style of the PWA header gauge. Specifically, the PWA gauge appears to be missing its fill color and is displayed as a grey circle with a white outline, unlike the other gauges which have their respective colors filled in.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how the PWA gauge is rendered in the report. The problem could be due to a missing or incorrect SVG fill color, a missing or incorrect CSS class, or an issue with the rendering logic that generates the gauge. The problem might also be related to how unique IDs are assigned to SVG elements within the gauge, as this could affect the rendering of the gauge's fill color.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/installable-manifest.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/offline-start-url.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/category-renderer.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/pwa-category-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/pwa-category-renderer.js
class: PwaCategoryRenderer
```

The `PwaCategoryRenderer` class is responsible for rendering the audit results of a specific category in a PWA report. The `renderScoreGauge` method in this class generates a visual score gauge for the category. If there is an issue with the gauge's fill color, it is likely related to this method.

#### lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-renderer.js

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```

The `ReportRenderer` class is responsible for generating a visual representation of a Lighthouse report. The `_renderReport` method orchestrates the rendering process and delegates category rendering to specialized renderers like `PwaCategoryRenderer`. If there is an issue with the gauge's fill color, it could be related to how the `ReportRenderer` class handles the rendering of the PWA category.

### Summary

The files `lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/pwa-category-renderer.js` and `lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/report-renderer.js` contain relevant classes that need inspection or editing to fix the problem. Specifically, the `PwaCategoryRenderer` class and the `ReportRenderer` class should be examined to identify and resolve the issue with the PWA gauge's fill color.
