### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that non-network URLs (such as data URIs) are being treated as actual network requests, resulting in server response times being calculated for them. This is incorrect because data URIs do not involve network requests and should not have server response times.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from the fact that the code does not properly distinguish between network URLs and non-network URLs (like data URIs). As a result, the code treats all URLs as if they were network requests, leading to the calculation of server response times even for data URIs.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/audits/network-server-latency.js

This file contains the `NetworkServerLatency` class, which evaluates server response latency. The issue described does not seem directly related to this class, as it focuses on analyzing server response times from provided artifacts. However, it might indirectly be affected if the artifacts themselves contain incorrect data.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### lighthouse-core/computed/network-analysis.js

This file contains the `NetworkAnalysis` class, which computes network performance metrics. The `computeRTTAndServerResponseTime` method calculates RTT and server response time for each origin. This method might be relevant if it does not properly handle non-network URLs.

```
lighthouse-core/computed/network-analysis.js
class: NetworkAnalysis
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js

This file contains various URL-related functions. The `elideDataURI` function specifically handles data URIs, which are relevant to the issue. The `getOrigin` function might also be relevant if it incorrectly identifies the origin of data URIs.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js
function: elideDataURI
function: getOrigin
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/network-analyzer.js

This file contains the `NetworkAnalyzer` class, which analyzes network request data. The `_estimateRTTByOriginViaHeadersEndTiming` and `estimateServerResponseTimeByOrigin` methods might be relevant if they do not properly handle non-network URLs.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/network-analyzer.js
class: NetworkAnalyzer
```

#### lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/simulator/tcp-connection.js

This file contains the `TcpConnection` class, which simulates TCP connections. This class is likely not directly relevant to the issue, as it deals with connection simulation rather than URL handling.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
