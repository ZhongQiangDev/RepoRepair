### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the report page is blank when it should display the Lighthouse report. The screenshot shows that there are JavaScript errors in the console, specifically:

- `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`
- `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'generatedTime' of undefined`

These errors indicate that there is an issue with the report generation or rendering process, leading to a blank page.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The errors suggest that there is a problem with the JSON data being passed to the report rendering functions. The `SyntaxError` likely indicates that the JSON data is malformed or contains unexpected characters, while the `TypeError` suggests that the JSON data is either missing or not properly structured, causing the `generatedTime` property to be undefined.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `lighthouse-core/closure/typedefs/viewer-externs.js`

This file contains type definitions and does not directly implement any functionality. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js`

This file contains the `ReportGeneratorV2` class, which is responsible for generating the report JSON and HTML. The `generateReportHtml` method is particularly relevant because it is responsible for injecting the JSON data into the HTML template.

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
class: ReportGeneratorV2
```

#### `lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js`

This file contains the `ReportRenderer` class, which is responsible for rendering the report data into a structured DOM representation. The `_renderReport` method and its related methods are relevant because they handle the actual rendering of the report.

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
class: ReportRenderer
```

#### `lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js`

This file contains the `LighthouseReportViewer` class, which manages the viewing and handling of Lighthouse reports. The `_onPaste`, `_onFileLoad`, and `replaceReportHTML` methods are relevant because they handle loading and rendering the report.

```
lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js
class: LighthouseReportViewer
```

#### `lighthouse-viewer/app/src/viewer-ui-features.js`

This file contains the `ViewerUIFeatures` class, which adds features specific to viewing and saving reports. The `getReportHtml` and `saveAsGist` methods are relevant because they handle generating and saving the report HTML.

```
lighthouse-viewer/app/src/viewer-ui-features.js
class: ViewerUIFeatures
```
