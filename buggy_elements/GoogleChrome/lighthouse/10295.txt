### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the Lighthouse audit tool is encountering an error when trying to detect versions of JavaScript libraries on certain websites, specifically Magento 2 websites. The error message is `version.match is not a function`, indicating that the `version` variable is not a string or does not have a `match` method, which is typically used for string operations.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error `version.match is not a function` suggests that the `version` variable is either `undefined`, `null`, or not a string when the `match` method is called. This could happen if the library detection logic is not correctly identifying the version of the JavaScript library, or if the version information is not being returned in the expected format. Given that Magento 2 uses `require.js` and has built-in JS bundling, it's possible that the library detection logic is not handling these cases correctly, leading to the `version` variable being set to an unexpected value.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### lighthouse-core/config/config-helpers.js

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js

```
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
function: collectStacks
function: detectLibraries
```

The `collectStacks` function is responsible for evaluating a JavaScript expression in the context of the page to detect JavaScript libraries and their versions. The `detectLibraries` function iterates over predefined library detection tests and attempts to extract version information. If the version information is not correctly extracted or is not a string, it could lead to the `version.match is not a function` error.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js
function: collectStacks
function: detectLibraries
```

These functions are directly related to the detection of JavaScript libraries and their versions, and should be inspected and potentially edited to fix the issue. The `collectStacks` function evaluates the JavaScript expression that includes the `detectLibraries` function, which is responsible for detecting the libraries and their versions. If the version information is not correctly handled in `detectLibraries`, it could result in the error described in the GitHub problem.
