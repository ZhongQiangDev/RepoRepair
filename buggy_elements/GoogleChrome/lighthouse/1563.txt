### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that Lighthouse is including irrelevant user timing marks in its analysis, particularly those injected by third-party services like Google Ads. This results in a cluttered and potentially misleading performance report.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the filtering mechanism within the Lighthouse audit process. Specifically, the `UserTimings` class in `lighthouse-core/audits/user-timings.js` is responsible for filtering and processing user timing events. The `blacklistedPrefixes` property and the `excludeBlacklisted` method are designed to filter out unwanted third-party marks and measures. However, it seems that the current list of blacklisted prefixes is not comprehensive enough to exclude all irrelevant user timing marks, such as those injected by Google Ads.

```

The `UserTimings` class is directly related to the issue. The `blacklistedPrefixes` property and the `excludeBlacklisted` method need to be inspected and potentially updated to include additional prefixes that should be filtered out.
