### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse is incorrectly identifying local resources (`file:///`) as render-blocking resources. This is incorrect because local resources are blocked from loading in the browser, and thus cannot block the rendering of the page.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how Lighthouse processes and categorizes resources. Specifically, it may be failing to correctly identify `file:///` URLs as non-network resources, leading it to incorrectly treat them as render-blocking resources. This could be due to a lack of proper handling for `file:///` URLs in the resource classification or timing analysis logic.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/render-blocking-resources.js ---
This file contains the core logic for identifying render-blocking resources. The `RenderBlockingResources` class and its methods are directly relevant to the issue.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/render-blocking-resources.js
class: RenderBlockingResources
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js ---
This file contains the `NetworkRequest` class, which encapsulates details about network requests. It includes methods for handling various network events and updating request states. Since local resources are not network resources, this class might need to be adjusted to correctly handle `file:///` URLs.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js
class: NetworkRequest
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js ---
This file contains utility methods for URL-related operations. The `URLShim` class and the `rewriteChromeInternalUrl` function might be relevant for correctly identifying and handling `file:///` URLs.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js
class: URLShim
function: rewriteChromeInternalUrl
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js ---
This file contains the `NetworkNode` class, which encapsulates a network request record. Since local resources are not network resources, this class might need to be adjusted to correctly handle `file:///` URLs.

```
lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js
class: NetworkNode
```

#### --- lighthouse-core/lib/tracehouse/main-thread-tasks.js ---
This file contains the `MainThreadTasks` class, which processes trace events from the main thread. While this class is important for task analysis, it is less likely to be directly relevant to the issue of incorrectly identifying local resources as render-blocking.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
