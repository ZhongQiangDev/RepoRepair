### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that while the `pwmetrics` project provides a UI for performance metrics, it would be more valuable to visualize these metrics against the timeline in the DevTools. The current implementation involves injecting fake trace events into the trace data to create markers in the Timeline view, but the UX of these markers is not ideal and could be improved.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is that the current method of visualizing performance metrics in the Timeline view involves injecting fake trace events into the trace data. This approach has limitations in terms of UX, as the markers created from these fake events are not well-integrated into the Timeline view and can be difficult to interpret. A more seamless integration of performance metrics into the Timeline view would require a better way to represent these metrics visually.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### lighthouse-core/audits/first-meaningful-paint.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The issue is related to visualizing metrics in the Timeline view, not the calculation of the First Meaningful Paint metric itself.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/speed-index-metric.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
Similar to the previous file, this file deals with the calculation of the Speed Index metric, not its visualization in the Timeline view.

#### lighthouse-core/audits/time-to-interactive.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is concerned with the calculation of the Time to Interactive metric, not its visualization.

#### lighthouse-core/gather/computed/speedline.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to computing the Speedline artifact, which is not directly related to the visualization issue.

#### lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js
```
lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js
function: prepareAssets
function: saveAssets
```
The `prepareAssets` function is responsible for generating fake events based on trace events and audit results, which are then concatenated to the original trace events. The `saveAssets` function saves these prepared assets to disk. These functions are directly related to the current method of visualizing metrics in the Timeline view and could be improved to better integrate the metrics into the Timeline view.
