### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the markdown list rendering is inconsistent depending on the number of blank lines between two different types of lists (unordered and ordered). Specifically:

- When there is no blank line or only one blank line between an unordered list and an ordered list, the ordered list is rendered as part of the unordered list.
- When there are two or more blank lines between the lists, the ordered list is rendered correctly as a separate list.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely related to how the markdown parser (in this case, the `marked` library) handles the separation of different list types. The parser may be interpreting the lack of sufficient blank lines as a continuation of the previous list rather than the start of a new list. This behavior could be due to the parser's rules for list separation, which might require a specific number of blank lines to distinguish between lists.

function: function_1
```

The `function_1` (marked) is the core function of the `marked` library, which is responsible for converting markdown text into HTML. This function is likely where the issue lies, as it handles the parsing of markdown lists and their conversion into HTML. The lexer and parser within this function may need to be adjusted to correctly handle the separation of different list types based on the number of blank lines.
