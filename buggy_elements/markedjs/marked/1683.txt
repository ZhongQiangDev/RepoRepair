### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that image links with alt text containing escaped square brackets (`\[` and `\]`) are not rendering correctly. Instead of displaying the image, the alt text is shown as plain text with the escaped square brackets.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the Markdown parser handles escaped characters within alt text. When the alt text contains escaped square brackets, the parser may not correctly interpret the image link syntax, leading to the alt text being displayed instead of the image.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/demo/demo.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
```
lib/marked.js
function: cleanUrl
function: escape
function: outputLink
```

- `cleanUrl`: This function is responsible for sanitizing URLs, but it does not directly handle alt text or image link syntax.
- `escape`: This function escapes special characters in HTML strings, which could be relevant if the alt text is being improperly escaped.
- `outputLink`: This function processes the output of image links and could be relevant if it is not correctly handling alt text with escaped characters.

#### --- src/Lexer.js ---
```
src/Lexer.js
function: inlineTokens
function: rules
```

- `inlineTokens`: This function processes inline elements, including images. It could be relevant if it is not correctly parsing alt text with escaped characters.
- `rules`: This function contains the rules for parsing various Markdown elements, including images. It could be relevant if the rules for image parsing are not correctly handling escaped characters in alt text.

#### --- src/Renderer.js ---
```
src/Renderer.js
function: image
```

- `image`: This function generates the HTML for image tags. It could be relevant if it is not correctly handling alt text with escaped characters.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: outputLink
function: codespan
```

- `outputLink`: This function processes Markdown links, including images. It could be relevant if it is not correctly handling alt text with escaped characters.
- `codespan`: This function processes inline code spans, which is not directly related to image links but could be relevant if there is a similar handling of escaped characters.
