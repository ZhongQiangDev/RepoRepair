### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the markdown table is not being rendered correctly by `Marked` version 0.4.0. Specifically, the table columns are not aligned properly, and the content within the table cells is not formatted as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to be related to how `Marked` version 0.4.0 handles markdown table syntax. The table in the markdown is correctly formatted according to standard markdown table syntax, but `Marked` is not rendering it as expected. This could be due to a bug in the `Marked` library version 0.4.0 or a configuration issue in how `Marked` is being used within the application.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### --- docs/demo/demo.js ---
This file contains functions that handle input changes, markdown parsing, and updating the output. The `checkForChanges` function uses `marked.lexer` and `marked.parser` to process the markdown content. This suggests that the issue might be related to how `marked` is being used in this file.

```
docs/demo/demo.js
function: checkForChanges
```

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
This file contains the core `marked` function, which is responsible for parsing markdown text into HTML. Since the issue is related to markdown table rendering, this file is highly relevant.

```
lib/marked.js
function: function_1
```

#### Other Files
The other functions listed in the `Relevant Files Information` do not appear to be directly related to markdown parsing or table rendering. Therefore, they are not relevant to the issue at hand.
