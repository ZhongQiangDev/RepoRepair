### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the strikethrough (`~~`) markdown syntax is not being rendered correctly. Specifically, the text within `~~` is not being displayed with a strikethrough effect in the preview.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the markdown parser not correctly identifying or rendering the strikethrough syntax. This could be due to:
- The parser not recognizing the `~~` syntax.
- The renderer not applying the appropriate HTML tag (`<del>`) for strikethrough text.
- The CSS not being applied correctly to the `<del>` tag.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- docs/demo/demo.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
```
lib/marked.js
function: del
```
The `del` function is responsible for wrapping text with `<del>` tags, which is relevant to the strikethrough rendering issue.

#### --- src/marked.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/Renderer.js ---
```
src/Renderer.js
function: del
```
The `del` function in the Renderer is responsible for wrapping text with `<del>` tags, which is relevant to the strikethrough rendering issue.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: del
```
The `del` function in the Tokenizer is responsible for identifying strikethrough syntax in the markdown text, which is relevant to the strikethrough rendering issue.

### Summary of Relevant Functions/Classes

The relevant functions identified are:
- `lib/marked.js`: `del`
- `src/Renderer.js`: `del`
- `src/Tokenizer.js`: `del`

These functions are directly involved in recognizing and rendering the strikethrough markdown syntax. Issues in any of these functions could lead to the observed rendering problem.
