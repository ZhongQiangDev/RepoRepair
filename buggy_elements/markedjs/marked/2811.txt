### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two main issues:

1. **Japanese Punctuation Issue**: When using Japanese punctuation (`„ÄÅ`) with strong syntax (`**`) and code syntax (`` ` ``), the parser fails to correctly parse the syntax unless there is a space between the strong syntax and the punctuation. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior, where no extra space should be required.

2. **Link Inside Strong Delimiter Issue**: When a link is inside a strong delimiter (`**`), followed closely by a character other than `[ .!,;]`, the strong delimiter does not work as expected. The strong syntax fails to bolden the wrapped text correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues likely stem from how the parser handles punctuation and delimiters in the context of strong syntax and inline elements like links. The parser may be too strict in its rules for closing delimiters, requiring specific characters or spaces to properly close the strong syntax. This could be due to the way the parser tokenizes and processes inline elements.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### --- src/helpers.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/marked.js ---
```
src/marked.js
function: function_12
function: function_16
```
- `function_12`: This function handles the parsing of inline markdown content and could be relevant to the issues described. It lexes the input into tokens and processes them, which might include handling strong syntax and inline elements like links.
- `function_16`: This function also parses inline markdown content and could be relevant for similar reasons as `function_12`.

#### --- src/Parser.js ---
```
src/Parser.js
class: Parser
function: parseInline
```
- `Parser`: The `Parser` class is responsible for parsing tokens into structured output. It handles various token types, including strong syntax and inline elements like links.
- `parseInline`: This function processes inline tokens and could be relevant to the issues described, as it handles strong syntax and inline elements.

#### --- src/Renderer.js ---
```
src/Renderer.js
function: strong
function: link
```
- `strong`: This function wraps text in `<strong>` tags and could be relevant to the strong syntax issue.
- `link`: This function generates anchor tags and could be relevant to the link inside strong delimiter issue.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: outputLink
```
- `outputLink`: This function processes matched link or image syntax and could be relevant to the link inside strong delimiter issue, as it handles the tokenization of links within strong syntax.
