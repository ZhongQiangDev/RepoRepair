### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in order to properly parse markdown text containing parentheses `(`, the user must escape them with a backslash `\(`. Without the backslash, the markdown parser fails to correctly interpret the parentheses, leading to incorrect or incomplete parsing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the markdown parsing logic. The parser may be treating parentheses `(` as special characters that need to be escaped to be interpreted literally. This suggests that the parser is not correctly handling unescaped parentheses as part of regular text, possibly due to how it processes inline links or other markdown syntax that uses parentheses.

function: function_1
```

**Reasoning:**
- The `function_1` function in `lib/marked.js` is the core entry point for parsing markdown content. It is responsible for lexing the markdown text into tokens and then parsing those tokens into the desired output format (typically HTML). The issue with parentheses not being correctly interpreted likely stems from how this function handles the lexing and parsing of the markdown text.
- The function merges user-provided options with defaults, lexes the markdown text into tokens, and parses the tokens into the target format. If the parser is not correctly handling unescaped parentheses, this function would need to be inspected and potentially modified to fix the issue.
