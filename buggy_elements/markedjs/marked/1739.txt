### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the handling of HTML comments in Markdown comments. Specifically:

- **GitHub and Marked Behavior**: Both GitHub and Marked do not render the HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) in the preview or final output. They are treated as comments and are not displayed.
- **Expected Behavior**: The user expects that comments ending with `--!>` should be supported and not displayed in the output.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the Markdown parser handles HTML comments. The parser may not recognize the `--!>` syntax as a valid comment terminator and instead treats the entire comment as plain text, leading to its display in the output.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
```
lib/marked.js
function: function_58
function: function_102
function: function_113
function: function_28
function: function_5
```

**Explanation**:
- `function_58`: This function is the `Renderer_1` class, which handles the rendering of various Markdown elements into HTML. It may need to be modified to correctly handle HTML comments.
- `function_102`: This function is the `Parser` class, which processes Markdown tokens and converts them into HTML. It may need to be adjusted to recognize and handle HTML comments properly.
- `function_113`: This function allows extending the marked library with custom renderers and tokenizers. It might be relevant if a custom renderer is needed to handle comments.
- `function_28`: This function is the `Tokenizer` class, which parses Markdown text into tokens. It may need to be modified to correctly tokenize HTML comments.
- `function_5`: This function is the `marked` function, which is the main entry point for converting Markdown to HTML. It may need to be adjusted to handle comments correctly.

#### --- src/defaults.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

**Explanation**: This file contains default configuration options and does not directly handle the parsing or rendering of Markdown content.

#### --- src/marked.js ---
```
src/marked.js
function: marked
function: function_5
function: function_6
```

**Explanation**:
- `marked`: This function is the main function for converting Markdown to HTML. It may need to be adjusted to handle comments correctly.
- `function_5`: This function sets options for the marked library and may need to be modified to include options for handling comments.
- `function_6`: This function extends the marked library with custom renderers and tokenizers and may be relevant if a custom renderer is needed to handle comments.

#### --- src/Renderer.js ---
```
src/Renderer.js
function: text
function: html
```

**Explanation**:
- `text`: This function handles plain text and may need to be modified to correctly handle HTML comments.
- `html`: This function handles HTML content and may need to be adjusted to recognize and handle HTML comments properly.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: html
function: inlineText
function: text
```

**Explanation**:
- `html`: This function handles HTML blocks and may need to be modified to correctly handle HTML comments.
- `inlineText`: This function processes inline text and may need to be adjusted to recognize and handle HTML comments.
- `text`: This function handles plain text and may need to be modified to correctly handle HTML comments.
