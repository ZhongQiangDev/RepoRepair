### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that lines containing only spaces are being removed during the markdown parsing process. This is problematic for certain use cases, such as real-time editing or esoteric programming languages like Whitespace, where spaces have syntactic significance.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises from the `blockTokens` function in the `Lexer.js` file. Specifically, the first line of the `blockTokens` function removes lines with only spaces. This behavior is not desirable in all cases, as it can interfere with the intended structure of the markdown content, especially in scenarios where spaces are significant.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- lib/marked.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/defaults.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/helpers.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/Lexer.js ---
```
src/Lexer.js
function: blockTokens
```

The `blockTokens` function is directly responsible for the behavior described in the issue. The first line of this function removes lines with only spaces, which is the cause of the problem.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
