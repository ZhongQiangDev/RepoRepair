### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that an empty space node appears as the last child of the last `list_item` in the semantic tree generated by `marked.lexer`. This space node is not expected and should instead be at the first level of the semantic tree, between the `List` and the next `Paragraph`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the lexer handles the space after the last list item. The lexer is likely treating the space as part of the list item's content instead of as a separate token that should be placed at the top level of the tree. This could be due to the way the lexer processes whitespace and list items, particularly when it encounters the end of a list.

### Explanation:

- **src/Lexer.js**:
  - `list`: This function processes the list tokens and may be responsible for how the list items are structured in the semantic tree.
  - `listitem`: This function processes individual list items and could be where the space is being incorrectly added.
  - `inline`: This function processes inline elements within block-level elements and might be relevant if the space is being treated as an inline element.
  - `blockTokens`: This function handles the overall tokenization of block-level elements and could be where the space should be placed at the top level.

- **src/Tokenizer.js**:
  - `list`: Similar to the Lexer's `list` function, this could be where the list structure is defined.
  - `listitem`: Similar to the Lexer's `listitem` function, this could be where the space is being incorrectly added.
  - `space`: This function specifically handles spaces and could be relevant to the issue.
  - `inlineText`: This function processes inline text and might be relevant if the space is being treated as inline text.

These functions are likely involved in the incorrect placement of the space node and should be inspected for potential fixes.
