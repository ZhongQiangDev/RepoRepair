### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that task lists are rendered even when the `gfm: false` option is set. According to the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) specification, task lists are an extension of GFM. Therefore, when `gfm: false` is set, task lists should not be rendered as interactive checkboxes but should instead be treated as plain text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the way the lexer or parser handles task list syntax (`[ ]` or `[x]`). When `gfm: false` is set, the lexer or parser should not recognize these patterns as task lists and should instead treat them as regular text. However, it appears that the lexer or parser is still recognizing these patterns as task lists even when GFM is disabled.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/defaults.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/Lexer.js ---
```
src/Lexer.js
function: list
function: blockTokens
```
- The `list` function processes list items and may need to check if GFM is enabled before recognizing task list syntax.
- The `blockTokens` function processes block-level elements and may need to ensure that task lists are only recognized when GFM is enabled.

#### --- src/Parser.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/Renderer.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/Tokenizer.js ---
```
src/Tokenizer.js
function: list
function: block
```
- The `list` function processes list items and may need to check if GFM is enabled before recognizing task list syntax.
- The `block` function processes block-level elements and may need to ensure that task lists are only recognized when GFM is enabled.
