### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that using the `flex` keyword in CSS results in a `TypeError: value.split is not a function`. This error suggests that somewhere in the code, a function is attempting to call the `split` method on a value that is not a string.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error message indicates that the `value.split` method is being called on a value that is not a string. This likely happens when the `flex` property is passed as a number or an object instead of a string. The `flex` property in CSS is typically a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`, and it should be a string value like `"1 1 0%"` or `"1"`. If the value is not a string, the `split` method will fail.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/layout/src/steps/resolveStyles.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js`

```
packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
function: function_15
function: function_16
function: function_17
```

The functions `function_15`, `function_16`, and `function_17` handle `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` respectively. These functions split the string value to extract the relevant parts. If the `flex` property is not a string, these functions will fail.

#### `packages/stylesheet/src/resolve.js`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/types/style.d.ts`

This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
function: function_15
function: function_16
function: function_17
```

These functions need to be inspected and potentially modified to ensure they handle non-string values gracefully. Specifically, they should check if the `value` is a string before attempting to call `split` on it. If the value is not a string, they should either convert it to a string or handle it in a way that does not cause the error.
