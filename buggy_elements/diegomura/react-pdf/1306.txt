### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the type definition for `SourceObject` in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` does not support a function that returns a `Promise<string>`, even though the documentation states that it should. This mismatch causes a compilation error when trying to use a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as the `src` for an `<Image>` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the type definition for `SourceObject` in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` does not include a type for a function that returns a `Promise<string>`. The documentation suggests that such a function should be supported, but the actual type definition does not reflect this. This discrepancy leads to the TypeScript compiler throwing an error when it encounters a function that returns a `Promise<string>` as the `src`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One from the 'Relevant Files Information'

#### `packages/examples/src/text/index.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### `packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js`
```
packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` (which should be named `resolveSrc`) is relevant because it handles the resolution of the `src` parameter. It needs to be updated to support a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.

#### `packages/types/image.d.ts`
```
packages/types/image.d.ts
function: SourceObject
```
The `SourceObject` type definition needs to be updated to include a function that returns a `Promise<string>`.

### Summary of Locations That Need Inspection or Editing

function: SourceObject
```

### Suggested Fixes

1. Update `SourceObject` in `packages/types/image.d.ts` to include a function that returns a `Promise<string>`:
   ```typescript
   export type SourceObject =
     | string
     | { data: Buffer; format: 'png' | 'jpg' }
     | { uri: string; method: HTTPMethod; body: any; headers: any }
     | (() => string | Promise<string>);
   ```

2. Update `resolveSrc` in `packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js` to handle a function that returns a `Promise<string>`:
   ```javascript
   async function resolveSrc(src) {
     if (typeof src === 'function') {
       const result = await src();
       return { uri: result };
     }
     return src;
   }
   ```
