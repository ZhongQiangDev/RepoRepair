### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a border is applied to a `<View>` with a `borderRadius`, the border does not render correctly as the `borderRadius` increases. Specifically:

- When `borderRadius` is set to 1, the border mostly goes around the view.
- When `borderRadius` is set to 3, the border starts to have issues.
- As the `borderRadius` increases further (e.g., 20 or 30), the border rendering becomes increasingly strange and incorrect.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the border is being drawn around the rounded corners of the `<View>`. The `drawBorders` function in `src/mixins/borders.js` is responsible for drawing the borders, and it uses `drawHorizontalBorder` and `drawVerticalBorder` functions to draw the borders with rounded corners. The problem may be related to how these functions handle the rounded corners when the `borderRadius` is increased.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/elements/View.js`
```
src/elements/View.js
class: View
```
The `View` class is relevant because it calls the `drawBorders` method in its `render` method. This method is responsible for drawing the borders around the `<View>`.

#### `src/mixins/borders.js`
```
src/mixins/borders.js
function: drawBorders
function: drawHorizontalBorder
function: drawVerticalBorder
```
The `drawBorders` function is responsible for drawing the borders around the element, and it uses `drawHorizontalBorder` and `drawVerticalBorder` to draw the borders with rounded corners. These functions may need to be inspected and potentially modified to handle larger `borderRadius` values correctly.

#### `src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in this file are related to expanding and transforming styles, but they do not directly handle the drawing of borders.

#### `src/stylesheet/yogaValue.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `yogaValue` function is related to converting CSS-like property values into Yoga layout engine constants, which is not directly related to the border drawing issue.

#### `src/utils/styles.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `flatStyles` function is used to merge style objects, which is not directly related to the border drawing issue.
