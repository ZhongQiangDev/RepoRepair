### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is the deprecation warning related to the `Buffer()` constructor. This warning indicates that the `Buffer()` constructor is deprecated due to security and usability issues and will be removed in future Node.js versions. This will break the rendering process when rendering a PDF.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the use of the deprecated `Buffer()` constructor in the codebase. The warning suggests using `Buffer.alloc()`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`, or `Buffer.from()` methods instead. The code needs to be updated to replace any instances of `Buffer()` with one of these recommended methods.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/font/src/font.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/image/src/jpeg.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/image/src/resolve.js ---
```
packages/image/src/resolve.js
function_5
```
- The `function_5` (internally named `fetchRemoteFile`) uses `response.buffer()` which is a deprecated method. This function needs to be updated to use `Buffer.from()` or another recommended method.

#### --- packages/pdfkit/src/image/jpeg.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- packages/pdfkit/src/image/png.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
