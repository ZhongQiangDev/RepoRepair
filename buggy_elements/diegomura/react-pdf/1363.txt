### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the RGBA color does not work correctly when applied to the `Text` component. Specifically, the color or background color set using RGBA values does not render as expected, unlike when using the same RGBA values with the `View` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from how the `Text` component handles RGBA colors compared to the `View` component. The discrepancy suggests that there might be an issue with how the `Text` component processes or applies the RGBA values, possibly in the rendering or color normalization steps.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- packages/layout/src/text/fontSubstitution.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The functions here are related to font substitution and do not directly handle color processing.

#### --- packages/pdfkit/src/mixins/color.js ---
```
packages/pdfkit/src/mixins/color.js
function: fillColor
function: strokeColor
function: _normalizeColor
function: _setColor
```
These functions are directly involved in color handling and normalization. The `fillColor` and `strokeColor` functions set the fill and stroke colors, respectively, and `_normalizeColor` normalizes the color values. The `_setColor` function sets the color space and applies the color. Any issues with RGBA color handling could be located here.

#### --- packages/render/src/primitives/renderSvgText.js ---
```
packages/render/src/primitives/renderSvgText.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```
These functions handle the rendering of SVG text and text spans. They apply color and opacity to the context before rendering the text. If the RGBA color is not being applied correctly, there might be an issue in how these functions handle the color and opacity settings.

#### --- packages/render/src/primitives/renderText.js ---
```
packages/render/src/primitives/renderText.js
function: function_1
```
This function handles the rendering of text nodes. It translates the context and delegates the actual rendering to `PDFRenderer.render`. If the color is not being applied correctly, there might be an issue in how this function sets up the context for rendering.

#### --- packages/stylesheet/src/colors.js ---
```
packages/stylesheet/src/colors.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```
These functions transform color values into different formats. If the RGBA color is not being transformed or normalized correctly, there might be an issue in these functions.
