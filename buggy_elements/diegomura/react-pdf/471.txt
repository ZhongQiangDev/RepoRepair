### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the styled components are not applying the overridden styles as expected. Specifically:

- The `ExampleText1`, `ExampleText2`, and `ExampleText3` components should display different border styles and colors based on the styled-components definitions.
- However, all three components appear to have the same styling, with only the left and right borders visible and the same color.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the styled-components are being processed and applied to the `Text` elements in `@react-pdf/renderer`. The problem could be related to:

- **Incorrect Style Resolution**: The styles defined in the styled-components might not be correctly resolved or applied to the `Text` elements.
- **Shorthand Property Handling**: The shorthand border properties (e.g., `border-left-width`, `border-right-width`) might not be correctly expanded or processed.
- **Color Overriding**: The color property might not be correctly overridden in the extended styled-components.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/elements/Text.js`
```
src/elements/Text.js
class: Text
```
The `Text` class is responsible for rendering and styling text elements. It includes methods for layout management, text styling, and rendering. The issue might be related to how styles are applied during rendering.

#### `src/stylesheet/borders.js`
```
src/stylesheet/borders.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
function: function_3
```
The functions in this file handle border-related CSS properties. `function_1` checks if a property is a border style, `function_2` matches shorthand border properties, and `function_3` processes border properties based on the key. These functions might not be correctly handling the shorthand border properties or applying the correct border styles.

#### `src/stylesheet/index.js`
```
src/stylesheet/index.js
function: function_2
function: function_5
function: function_7
```
The functions in this file handle style flattening, media query resolution, and style transformation. `function_2` flattens input styles, `function_5` resolves media queries, and `function_7` processes styles through flattening, media query resolution, and transformation. The issue might be related to how styles are flattened or transformed.

#### `src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js`
```
src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js
function: function_1
function: function_2
```
The functions in this file expand and transform styles. `function_1` expands shorthand properties into longhand equivalents, and `function_2` processes styles through expansion, property resolution, and scalar parsing. The issue might be related to how shorthand properties are expanded or resolved.

#### `src/utils/styles.js`
```
src/utils/styles.js
function: function_1
```
The `flatStyles` function merges an array of style objects into a single object. This function might not be correctly merging the styles from the styled-components.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

- `src/elements/Text.js`: The `Text` class is responsible for rendering and styling text elements.
- `src/stylesheet/borders.js`: Functions `function_1`, `function_2`, and `function_3` handle border-related CSS properties.
- `src/stylesheet/index.js`: Functions `function_2`, `function_5`, and `function_7` handle style flattening, media query resolution, and style transformation.
- `src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js`: Functions `function_1` and `function_2` expand and transform styles.
- `src/utils/styles.js`: Function `function_1` merges an array of style objects.
