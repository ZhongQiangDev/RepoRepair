### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `flexBasis` rule does not work as expected after upgrading from version 1.6.14 to 2.0.8. Specifically, the text elements "One," "Two," and "Three" are not being laid out according to their specified `flexBasis` values of "50%," "25%," and "25%," respectively. Instead, they are displayed in a single line without any spacing, indicating that the `flexBasis` property is not being applied correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `flexBasis` property is being processed and applied to the Yoga node. The `flexBasis` property is responsible for determining the initial main size of a flex item, and if it is not being set correctly, the layout will not reflect the intended proportions.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
This file contains a function `setYogaValue` which is responsible for setting various Yoga properties, including `flexBasis`. This function is directly relevant to the issue since it handles the application of `flexBasis` to the Yoga node.

```
packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
function: function_1
```

#### packages/layout/src/node/setFlexDirection.js
This file contains a function `setFlexDirection` which sets the flex direction on a Yoga node. While this function is related to flexbox layout, it does not directly handle `flexBasis`. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/layout/src/node/setJustifyContent.js
This file contains a function `setJustifyContent` which sets the justify content alignment on a Yoga node. This function is not directly related to the `flexBasis` property.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js
This file contains several functions related to resolving dimensions and persisting layout data. While these functions are part of the layout process, they do not directly handle the `flexBasis` property.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
This file contains a function `processFlexBasis` which processes the `flexBasis` value. This function is relevant because it handles the transformation of the `flexBasis` value before it is applied to the Yoga node.

```
packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
function: function_17
```
