### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `margin auto` functionality is not working correctly in version 2 of `react-pdf`. Specifically, when comparing the layout of elements in version 1 and version 2, the elements in version 2 do not align or space themselves as expected when `margin auto` is applied.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how `margin auto` is being handled in the layout calculations for version 2. In CSS, `margin auto` is typically used to center elements or distribute space around them. If this is not working as expected, it could be due to incorrect handling of margin values, alignment properties, or layout calculations in the code.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `packages/layout/src/node/getMargin.js`

This file contains functions related to getting margin values for nodes. The function `function_2` calculates margins for a given Yoga node, which is relevant to the issue since it deals with margin values.

```
packages/layout/src/node/getMargin.js
function: function_2
```

#### `packages/layout/src/node/setAlign.js`

This file contains a function for setting alignment properties. While alignment is related to layout, the specific issue described is with `margin auto`, which is more directly related to margin calculations rather than alignment.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js`

This file contains a function for setting Yoga properties, including handling 'auto' values. The function `function_1` specifically handles 'auto' values for properties like `flexBasis`, which could be relevant if `margin auto` is being treated similarly.

```
packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
function: function_1
```

#### `packages/layout/src/steps/resolvePercentHeight.js`

This file contains functions for resolving percentage-based heights. While this is related to layout calculations, it does not directly deal with margin values or `margin auto`.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `packages/layout/src/steps/resolveStyles.js`

This file contains functions for resolving styles, including applying styles to nodes and their children. While this is related to overall style application, it does not specifically deal with margin calculations.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

Based on the analysis, the following locations are relevant to the issue:

```
packages/layout/src/node/getMargin.js
function: function_2

packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
function: function_1
```
