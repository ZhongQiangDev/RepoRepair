### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a comment is placed on the same line as a decorator in Python code, the entire line is incorrectly highlighted with the `hljs-meta` class instead of properly distinguishing the decorator and the comment. Specifically, the comment section (`#` onwards) should be highlighted with the `hljs-comment` class.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the syntax highlighting rules are defined for decorators and comments in the Python language definition. The current rules may not correctly differentiate between the decorator and the comment when they appear on the same line, causing the entire line to be treated as metadata (`hljs-meta`) instead of recognizing the comment separately.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/python-repl.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue described is related to Python syntax highlighting in general code, not specifically in a REPL environment.

#### `src/languages/python.js`
```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `python.js` defines the overall Python language syntax highlighting rules. It includes rules for decorators, comments, and other language constructs. The issue likely lies in how decorators and comments are defined and matched within this function.

#### `src/lib/modes.js`
```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` (named `COMMENT`) in `modes.js` is responsible for creating a comment mode for syntax highlighting. While this function is relevant to comment highlighting in general, it may not directly address the specific issue with decorators and comments on the same line.

#### `src/plugins/vue.js`
This file contains no relevant functions/classes. The issue is related to Python syntax highlighting and not to Vue.js or its plugins.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

1. ```
src/languages/python.js

2. ```
src/lib/modes.js
