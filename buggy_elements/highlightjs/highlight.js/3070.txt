### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that when the `language-php` class is added to a `<code>` element, an extra `php` tag is added to the highlighted code. This results in incorrect HTML output and potentially disrupts the expected behavior of the syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the `highlight.js` library processes the `language-php` class. Specifically, it appears that the library is interpreting the `language-php` class as a signal to add an additional `php` tag, which is not the intended behavior. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the language definition for PHP or an issue in the core highlighting logic.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- demo/demo.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The issue described is related to the core highlighting functionality and language definitions, not the demo setup.

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
```
src/highlight.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `src/highlight.js` is the core initialization and configuration module for the `highlight.js` library. It contains the `highlightElement()` and `highlightAll()` functions, which are responsible for applying syntax highlighting to DOM elements. The issue might be related to how these functions handle the `language-php` class.

#### --- src/languages/php-template.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The `php-template.js` file defines rules for PHP templates embedded within XML or HTML. The issue described is related to the `language-php` class, not PHP templates.

#### --- src/languages/php.js ---
```
src/languages/php.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `src/languages/php.js` defines the language rules for PHP. It is possible that the issue lies in how these rules are defined or applied when the `language-php` class is used.

#### --- src/lib/utils.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The utility functions in `src/lib/utils.js` are general-purpose functions and do not directly relate to the language definitions or highlighting logic.
