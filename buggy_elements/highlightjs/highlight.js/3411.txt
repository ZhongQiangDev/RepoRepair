### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that in the type parameter `OutT`, only the first component `Out` is highlighted differently from the `T`. This indicates an issue with how type parameters are being parsed and highlighted in TypeScript syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the TypeScript syntax highlighting rules are defined. Specifically, the rules for recognizing and highlighting type parameters may not be correctly configured to handle camel-case type parameters as a single unit. This could be due to the regular expressions or patterns used to match type parameters not accounting for the full camel-case structure.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `typescript.js` is responsible for configuring the syntax highlighting rules for TypeScript. It is likely that the issue lies within the rules defined for type parameters. Specifically, the `KEYWORDS` and `contains` array might need to be adjusted to correctly handle camel-case type parameters.
