### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the number `0` on its own and numbers starting with `0` (like `0123`) are not being highlighted as numbers. Additionally, in floating-point numbers starting with `0` (like `0.3`), only the digits after the decimal point are highlighted as numbers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the regular expression used to match numbers in the Elixir syntax highlighting configuration. The current regular expression for numbers may not be correctly identifying `0` as a standalone number or numbers starting with `0`. It might also be incorrectly handling floating-point numbers starting with `0`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/elixir.js`

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for the Elixir language. The relevant function is `function_1`, which defines the syntax highlighting rules. Within this function, the `NUMBER` object is responsible for defining the regular expression that matches numbers in Elixir.

````
src/languages/elixir.js
function: function_1
````

The `NUMBER` object within `function_1` needs to be inspected and potentially modified to correctly handle the cases mentioned in the GitHub problem description. Specifically, the regular expression used in `NUMBER` should be updated to ensure that `0` on its own, numbers starting with `0`, and floating-point numbers starting with `0` are all correctly identified and highlighted as numbers.

### Summary

The `NUMBER` object within the `function_1` function in `src/languages/elixir.js` needs to be inspected and potentially modified to fix the issue. No other files or functions appear to be directly related to this specific problem.
