### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two issues:

1. **Scala Comment Rendering Issue**: In Scala code, comments (using `//`) are incorrectly rendered as titles when they appear on the same line as a class declaration but before the opening curly brace `{`. This causes the comment text to be highlighted as if it were part of the class title.

2. **JavaScript Comment Highlighting Issue**: In JavaScript code, comments inside function parameters are not highlighted correctly. The comments are not recognized as comments and thus do not receive the appropriate styling.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Scala Comment Rendering Issue:
The issue likely stems from how the Highlight.js library is parsing and categorizing the tokens in Scala code. Specifically, the parser might be incorrectly interpreting the comment as part of the class title when it appears on the same line as the class declaration but before the opening curly brace. This could be due to the way the language definition for Scala is set up in Highlight.js.

#### JavaScript Comment Highlighting Issue:
The issue here is likely related to how Highlight.js handles comments within function parameters in JavaScript. The language definition for JavaScript might not have rules that properly recognize comments within function parameter lists, leading to the comments being ignored during the highlighting process.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/languages/coffeescript.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/javascript.js`
```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function defines the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript. It includes the `COMMENT` definition which should handle comments. However, it seems that the rules for handling comments within function parameters might be missing or incorrectly defined.

#### `src/languages/typescript.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/lib/modes.js`
```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` function, named `COMMENT`, is responsible for creating a comment mode for syntax highlighting. This function might need to be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles comments in various contexts, including within function parameters.

#### `src/plugins/vue.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
