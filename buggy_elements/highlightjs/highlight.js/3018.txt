### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `BigInt` type is not being highlighted as a built-in type in the same way that `Number` is. The `BigInt` type, along with `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array`, should be recognized and highlighted appropriately in the syntax highlighting system.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` in the list of built-in types that the syntax highlighting system recognizes for ECMAScript and JavaScript. The system needs to be updated to include these types in its list of built-ins so that they can be properly highlighted.

```
The `function_1` function in this file is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript. It includes a `KEYWORDS` object that categorizes keywords, literals, and built-ins. To fix the issue, `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` should be added to the `built_in` category within the `KEYWORDS` object.
