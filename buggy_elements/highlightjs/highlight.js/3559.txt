### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the curly braces `{}` in the class inheritance context are highlighted with different colors, whereas they should be highlighted with the same color as shown in the expected behavior image.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the syntax highlighting rules for Kotlin are defined in the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the rules for identifying and highlighting curly braces within class definitions and inheritance contexts may not be correctly configured. This could be due to incorrect or missing patterns in the Kotlin language definition that handle these specific cases.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/kotlin.js ---
This file contains the Kotlin language definition for syntax highlighting. It is highly relevant to the issue since it defines the patterns and rules for highlighting Kotlin code.

```
src/languages/kotlin.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- src/languages/lib/css-shared.js ---
This file contains shared CSS-related syntax highlighting modes. It is not directly relevant to the Kotlin syntax highlighting issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
This file contains TypeScript type definitions for various Highlight.js components. While these types are used in the implementation, they do not directly define the syntax highlighting rules for Kotlin.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
