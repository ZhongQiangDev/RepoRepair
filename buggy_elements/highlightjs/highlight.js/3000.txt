### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the PHP arrow functions (`fn`) are not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, the variables within the arrow function body are being incorrectly highlighted as `title` instead of `variable`. This is evident from the provided images where `$x` and `$y` are highlighted as `title` instead of `variable`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the PHP language definition within the Highlight.js library. The current rules for identifying and highlighting PHP arrow functions (`fn`) are not correctly distinguishing between the function parameters and the variables within the function body. As a result, the variables within the function body are being misclassified as `title`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `php.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for PHP. The issue likely lies within the rules defined for PHP arrow functions (`fn`). The current rules may not be correctly distinguishing between the function parameters and the variables within the function body.
