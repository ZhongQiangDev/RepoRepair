### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that some C++ code cannot be rendered correctly. Specifically, the code involving Eigen library operations is not being highlighted properly, as shown in the images provided. The expected behavior is that the C++ code should be highlighted correctly, including keywords, comments, and Eigen-specific syntax.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue could be related to the syntax highlighting configuration for C++ in the Highlight.js library. The problem might stem from:

- Incorrect or incomplete language definition for C++ in the Highlight.js library.
- Lack of specific rules for handling Eigen library syntax.
- Incorrect usage of the `highlight` function in the code that renders the C++ code.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/c.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/cpp.js ---
```
src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `cpp.js` is responsible for configuring the C++ syntax highlighting. It might need to be updated to include specific rules for handling Eigen library syntax.

#### --- src/languages/csharp.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- tools/perf.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```

### Recommendations

1. **Update `function_1` in `cpp.js`**: Ensure that the C++ language definition includes specific rules for handling Eigen library syntax. This might involve adding new keywords, patterns, or modes specific to Eigen.
2. **Review `highlight` Function Usage**: Ensure that the `highlight` function is being used correctly in the code that renders the C++ code. Verify that the language is set to "cpp" and that the `ignoreIllegals` option is set appropriately.
3. **Test with Sample Code**: After making changes, test the rendering of the sample C++ code provided in the GitHub problem description to ensure that it is highlighted correctly.
