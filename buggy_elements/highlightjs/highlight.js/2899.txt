### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that an empty block comment (`/**/`) in Dart code breaks the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code. Specifically, the code after the empty block comment is not highlighted correctly, as shown in the images provided.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely arises from how the Dart syntax highlighting rules handle block comments. When an empty block comment is encountered, the highlighting engine might not properly recognize the end of the comment, causing it to treat the rest of the code as part of the comment. This could be due to a flaw in the regular expressions or logic used to define the start and end of block comments in the Dart language definition.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/dart.js ---
This file contains the Dart language definition and is highly relevant to the issue. The function `function_1` defines the syntax highlighting rules for Dart, including comments. We need to examine how block comments are defined and handled.

```
src/languages/dart.js
function: function_1
```

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
This file contains general functions for defining syntax highlighting modes. The `COMMENT` function is relevant because it defines how comments are handled in general. However, the specific issue is likely in the Dart language definition rather than the general comment handling.

```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
This file contains type definitions and is not directly involved in the syntax highlighting logic. It is unlikely to be the source of the issue.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
