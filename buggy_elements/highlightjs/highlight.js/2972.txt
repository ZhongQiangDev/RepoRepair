### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub issue is that **highlight.js** does not provide adequate support for Python Type Hints (PEP 484). Specifically, it fails to properly highlight type annotations such as `Dict[int, Any]` and `List[float]` in the provided sample code. The expected behavior is for these type hints to be highlighted similarly to how they are handled by other syntax highlighters like **Magic Python**.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way **highlight.js** handles Python syntax highlighting. Specifically, the current configuration for Python in `src/languages/python.js` may not include rules for recognizing and highlighting type hints. The regular expressions and patterns used to identify different elements of Python code might not be comprehensive enough to cover type hints introduced by PEP 484.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### `src/highlight.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The core functionality of `highlight.js` is not directly responsible for the specific language configurations. Therefore, this file is not directly relevant to the issue.

#### `src/languages/python.js`
```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `src/languages/python.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Python. It is likely that this function needs to be updated to include rules for recognizing and highlighting type hints.

#### `src/lib/modes.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in `src/lib/modes.js` are general utilities for creating syntax highlighting modes and do not specifically relate to Python or type hints.

#### `tools/lib/language.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The functions in `tools/lib/language.js` are related to compiling and managing language modules but do not directly affect the syntax highlighting rules.

#### `types/index.d.ts`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The types defined in `types/index.d.ts` are TypeScript types and do not directly impact the runtime behavior of the syntax highlighting.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `src/languages/python.js` is the primary location that needs to be inspected and potentially modified to add support for Python Type Hints. This function defines the rules and patterns used for Python syntax highlighting, and adding appropriate regular expressions and rules for type hints should resolve the issue.
