### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the syntax highlighting of primitive types (`int`, `char`, etc.) in C++ code. After the change in hljs 11.0.0, primitive types are no longer highlighted as keywords, leading to inconsistent and unnatural highlighting compared to the previous version. This results in a less readable and confusing code presentation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is the modification made in commit `1be7a28`, where primitive types were moved from the `RESERVED_TYPES` list to the `RESERVED_KEYWORDS` list. This change altered how Highlight.js treats these primitive types, causing them to be highlighted differently than before. The goal is to revert this change so that primitive types are once again highlighted as keywords, consistent with the C++ standard and common practices in popular IDEs.

### 3. Examine Each File and Determine Relevant Functions/Classes

#### src/languages/arduino.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
The issue is specific to C++ syntax highlighting, and this file deals with Arduino, which is a superset of C++. While it uses `keyword` for Arduino-specific data types, it does not directly affect the C++ primitive types.

#### src/languages/c.js
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file configures syntax highlighting for the C language, not C++. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

#### src/languages/cpp.js
```
src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```
This file is directly relevant because it configures the C++ language definition. The function `function_1` is responsible for setting up the C++ syntax highlighting rules. The change that needs to be made likely involves modifying how primitive types are treated within this function.

#### types/index.d.ts
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not directly influence the behavior of syntax highlighting.

### Summary of Relevant Locations
