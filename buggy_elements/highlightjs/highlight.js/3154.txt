### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that heredocs without interpolation in Ruby are not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, the content within the heredoc without interpolation (`<<-'MESSAGE'`) is not being recognized as a string, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules for Ruby heredocs in the Highlight.js library. The rules for detecting and highlighting heredocs with and without interpolation may not be properly distinguishing between the two cases. The regular expressions or patterns used to identify the start and end of heredocs might not be correctly configured to handle the `-` symbol that indicates no interpolation.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### src/languages/ruby.js

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for Ruby. It is highly relevant to the issue since it defines the rules for highlighting Ruby code, including heredocs.

```
src/languages/ruby.js
function: function_1
```

#### src/lib/modes.js

This file contains utility functions for creating syntax highlighting modes. While it includes functions like `COMMENT` and `END_SAME_AS_BEGIN`, these are general utilities and not specific to Ruby heredocs.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### src/lib/utils.js

This file contains utility functions like `escapeHTML`, `inherit`, `mergeStreams`, `nodeStream`, and `tag`. These functions are general utilities and not specific to Ruby heredocs.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### tools/checkAutoDetect.js

This file contains functions for testing auto-detection of languages. It is not directly related to the syntax highlighting rules for Ruby heredocs.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### types/index.d.ts

This file contains TypeScript type definitions for Highlight.js. While it includes types related to syntax highlighting, it does not contain specific rules or configurations for Ruby heredocs.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The relevant file and function for fixing the issue are:

```
src/languages/ruby.js
function: function_1
```
