### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that member functions within ES6 classes are not being highlighted when using `highlight.js` in a React application with `marked`. The screenshot shows that while other parts of the code are highlighted, the member functions are not.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the configuration or rules defined in `highlight.js` for JavaScript syntax highlighting. Specifically, the rules for recognizing and highlighting member functions within ES6 classes might not be properly defined or applied. This could be due to:

- Missing or incorrect regular expressions for identifying member functions.
- Incorrect configuration of the `highlight.js` library when used with `marked`.
- Incomplete or outdated language definitions for JavaScript in `highlight.js`.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/javascript.js ---
```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains the function `function_1`, which defines the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript. It is highly relevant because it sets up the rules for highlighting various JavaScript constructs, including functions. If the rules for member functions in ES6 classes are not correctly defined here, it could explain why they are not being highlighted.

#### --- src/languages/typescript.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is for TypeScript syntax highlighting and is not directly relevant to the JavaScript highlighting issue.

#### --- src/plugins/vue.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to Vue.js and does not contain any functions or classes relevant to the JavaScript syntax highlighting issue.

#### --- tools/lib/language.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file deals with compiling and managing language modules but does not directly define the syntax highlighting rules.

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains TypeScript type definitions and does not directly affect the syntax highlighting behavior.

### Conclusion

The primary location to inspect and potentially edit is:
```
src/languages/javascript.js
function: function_1
```
This function defines the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript, and ensuring that it correctly identifies and highlights member functions within ES6 classes should resolve the issue.
