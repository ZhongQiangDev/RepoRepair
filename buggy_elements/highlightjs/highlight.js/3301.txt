### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that inline comments in CSS are not highlighted correctly when using the `highlightAll` function in version 10.6.0 of the highlight.js library. Specifically, the inline comment `/* inline comment */` within the `width` property is not highlighted as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from changes in the `highlightAll` function between versions 10.5.0 and 10.6.0. The `highlightAll` function is responsible for automatically highlighting all `<pre><code>` blocks on the page. If the function's implementation changed in a way that affects how it processes CSS comments, it could lead to the observed behavior.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
```
src/highlight.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function contains the core initialization and configuration for the highlight.js library, including the `highlightAll` function. Since the issue is related to the `highlightAll` function, this file is relevant.

#### --- src/languages/css.js ---
```
src/languages/css.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function in this file defines the syntax highlighting configuration for CSS. It includes rules for highlighting various parts of CSS, including comments. Therefore, this file is relevant.

#### --- src/languages/lib/css-shared.js ---
```
src/languages/lib/css-shared.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` function in this file defines additional syntax highlighting modes for CSS, including the `ATTRIBUTE_SELECTOR_MODE`. While this file does not directly handle comments, it is part of the CSS highlighting configuration and could be indirectly relevant.

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```
The `function_3` function, named `COMMENT`, is responsible for creating a comment mode for syntax highlighting. This function is directly relevant to the issue since it defines how comments are highlighted.

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not include any functions or classes that directly affect the highlighting behavior. Therefore, it is not relevant to the issue.
