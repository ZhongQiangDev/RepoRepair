### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `LL` suffix is used in C/C++ integer literals, only the first `L` is highlighted, while both `L`s should be highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the regular expression or pattern matching rules defined for highlighting integer literals in the C/C++ language definitions. Specifically, the pattern used to match the `LL` suffix might not be correctly configured to highlight both `L`s.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/c-like.js ---
This file contains the base language definition for C-like languages, including C and C++. The `NUMBERS` object within this file likely contains the pattern for matching integer literals, including the `LL` suffix.

````
src/languages/c-like.js
function: function_1
````

#### --- src/languages/c.js ---
This file configures syntax highlighting for the C programming language. It relies on the base definition from `c-like.js`, so any issues with the `LL` suffix highlighting would likely be inherited from there.

````
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
````

#### --- src/languages/cpp.js ---
This file configures syntax highlighting for the C++ programming language. Similar to `c.js`, it relies on the base definition from `c-like.js`.

````
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
````

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
This file contains utility functions for creating syntax highlighting modes, but it does not directly define the language-specific rules for C/C++.

````
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
````

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
This file contains type definitions for the Highlight.js library. It does not directly influence the behavior of syntax highlighting rules.

````
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

### Summary of Relevant Locations

The primary location that needs inspection or editing to fix the problem is:

````
src/languages/c-like.js
function: function_1
````

This function defines the base language configuration for C-like languages, including the patterns for highlighting integer literals. The `NUMBERS` object within this function should be examined to ensure that the pattern for the `LL` suffix correctly highlights both `L`s.
