### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `switch` statement is not highlighted correctly in C++ code starting from version 10.7.0 of the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the `switch` keyword is not highlighted in the same way as other control flow keywords like `if`, `while`, and `for`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from changes in the syntax highlighting rules for C++ in the Highlight.js library between versions 10.6.0 and 10.7.0. The `switch` keyword might not be included in the list of keywords that are highlighted for C++ in the newer version, or there might be a change in how the `switch` statement is parsed and matched against the highlighting rules.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- demo/demo.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to the setup and behavior of a demo page and does not directly affect the syntax highlighting rules for C++.

#### --- src/languages/c.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file configures syntax highlighting for the C language, not C++. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to the issue.

#### --- src/languages/cpp.js ---
```
src/languages/cpp.js
function: function_1
```
This file is responsible for configuring the syntax highlighting rules for C++. The issue likely lies within `function_1`, where the base language definition for C++ is modified. The `switch` keyword might not be included in the list of keywords that are highlighted, or there might be a change in how the `switch` statement is parsed.

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains utility functions for creating syntax highlighting modes but does not directly define the rules for C++.

#### --- types/index.d.ts ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file contains type definitions and does not directly affect the syntax highlighting rules.

### Summary of Relevant Locations
