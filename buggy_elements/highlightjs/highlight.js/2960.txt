### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the regex detection after the keyword `m` fails when using a slash `/` as a delimiter in Perl code. Specifically, the regex `m(/$)` is not being correctly highlighted as a regex pattern, causing the entire line to be misinterpreted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the regex pattern matching logic within the Perl language definition in Highlight.js. The current implementation may not properly handle the `m` operator with arbitrary delimiters, including the slash `/`. This results in the regex not being recognized correctly, leading to improper highlighting.

function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `src/languages/perl.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Perl. The issue likely stems from how regex patterns are defined and matched within this function. Specifically, the `PERL_DEFAULT_CONTAINS` array, which includes patterns for highlighting different parts of Perl code, may need to be adjusted to correctly handle the `m` operator with arbitrary delimiters.
