### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the syntax highlighting incorrectly treats the function capture `&letter?/1` as if the `/` is part of a different syntax, causing the highlighting to break. Specifically, the `/` in `&letter?/1` is not being recognized as part of the function capture syntax, leading to incorrect highlighting of the subsequent code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the regular expressions or rules defined for recognizing function captures in the Elixir syntax highlighting configuration. The current rules may not properly account for the `&function_name/arity` syntax, leading to the `/` being misinterpreted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/elixir.js`

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for the Elixir language. The issue described is related to the highlighting of function captures, so we need to examine the relevant parts of this file.

```javascript
src/languages/elixir.js
function: function_1
```

Within `function_1`, we need to inspect the following:

- The regular expressions and rules that define how function captures are recognized.
- The `FUNCTION` object, which represents function definitions, may need to be adjusted to properly handle function captures.
- The `ELIXIR_DEFAULT_CONTAINS` array, which contains the main syntax highlighting rules, should be checked to ensure it includes the correct rules for function captures.

### Relevant Locations for Inspection or Editing

```
src/languages/elixir.js
function: function_1
```

### Summary

The `function_1` function in `src/languages/elixir.js` needs to be inspected and potentially modified to correctly handle the `&function_name/arity` syntax for function captures. This involves reviewing and adjusting the regular expressions and rules that define how function captures are recognized within the Elixir syntax highlighting configuration.
