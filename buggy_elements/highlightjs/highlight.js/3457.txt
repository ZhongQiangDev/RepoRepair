### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when both bold and italics are applied to a piece of text using Markdown syntax (e.g., `***bold and italic***`), the rest of the document incorrectly renders as bold and italicized, ignoring the closing bold/italics characters. This means that the formatting does not properly close, affecting the rest of the document.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the way the Markdown parser handles nested or combined formatting characters. Specifically, the parser may not correctly identify the closing sequence for combined bold and italic formatting (`***`), leading it to misinterpret subsequent text as still being within the bold and italic formatting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/markdown.js`

This file contains the function `function_1`, which is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Markdown using the Highlight.js library. The function defines patterns for various Markdown elements, including `BOLD` and `ITALIC`. Since the issue involves the incorrect rendering of combined bold and italic formatting, the patterns defined for `BOLD` and `ITALIC` are directly relevant.

The `BOLD` and `ITALIC` patterns are defined as mutually inclusive, meaning they can contain each other. However, the issue suggests that the parser may not be correctly handling the closing sequence for combined formatting. Therefore, the function `function_1` is relevant and may need to be inspected or edited to fix the problem.

#### Relevant Locations in `src/languages/markdown.js`

```
src/languages/markdown.js
function: function_1
```

This file contains the relevant function `function_1` that defines the syntax highlighting rules for Markdown, including the patterns for `BOLD` and `ITALIC`. Inspecting and potentially editing this function could resolve the issue with combined bold and italic formatting.
