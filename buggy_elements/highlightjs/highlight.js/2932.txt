### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the syntax highlighting for `.properties` files incorrectly handles trailing escaped backslashes (`\\`). Specifically, when a line ends with an escaped backslash, the syntax highlighting does not correctly recognize it as part of the string value, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the syntax highlighting rules for `.properties` files are defined. Specifically, the regular expressions used to match the end of a string value may not correctly account for escaped backslashes at the end of a line. This could result in the highlighting engine prematurely ending the string value, leading to incorrect highlighting.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One
