### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `highlight.js` library is not correctly highlighting SQL code containing string escape sequences. Specifically, the highlighting breaks after encountering a string escape sequence in the dynamic SQL code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how `highlight.js` handles string escape sequences in SQL code. The library may not be properly recognizing or handling the escape sequences within strings, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. This could be due to a flaw in the SQL language definition within `highlight.js`, particularly in the string modes configuration.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/highlight.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/languages/sql.js ---
```
src/languages/sql.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in `src/languages/sql.js` is responsible for configuring the SQL syntax highlighting. It defines string modes, including how escape sequences are handled. The issue likely lies here, as the string modes may not be correctly configured to handle escape sequences within SQL strings.

#### --- src/plugins/vue.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- tools/lib/language.js ---
