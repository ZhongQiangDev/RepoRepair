### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `bash` language does not highlight specific characters and elements as expected. These include:
- `|` (pipe)
- `\` (continue command marker)
- `>` and `<` (stream redirections)
- `<<` and `<<<` (here-doc and here-string)
- `$(...)` (subshell variable)

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting configuration for the `bash` language. The `bash.js` file is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for the `bash` language. If these specific characters and elements are not included in the syntax highlighting rules, they will not be highlighted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/bash.js`

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for the `bash` language. It defines various patterns and rules that Highlight.js uses to identify and highlight different elements of the code. The issue described in the GitHub problem is directly related to this file.

```
src/languages/bash.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/languages/shell.js`

This file defines a custom syntax highlighting rule for shell session commands. It does not directly relate to the issue described in the GitHub problem, as the problem is specific to the `bash` language.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/lib/modes.js`

This file contains utility functions for generating syntax highlighting rules. While these functions may be used by the `bash.js` file, they are not directly responsible for the issue described in the GitHub problem.

```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Summary

The issue described in the GitHub problem is directly related to the `bash.js` file, specifically the `function_1` function. This function is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for the `bash` language, and it needs to be inspected and potentially edited to include the missing highlighting rules for the specified characters and elements.
