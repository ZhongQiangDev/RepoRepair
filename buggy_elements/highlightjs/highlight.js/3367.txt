### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when a number is directly followed by a keyword in Python code, the syntax highlighting does not correctly separate the number and the keyword. Instead, it treats the number and the keyword as a single entity, which leads to incorrect highlighting. For example, in the code `print(1if 0==0else"b")`, the `1if` is highlighted as a single token, whereas it should be highlighted as `1` (number) and `if` (keyword) separately.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the regular expressions and rules defined for identifying numbers and keywords in the Python syntax highlighting configuration. The current rules may not properly account for the scenario where a number is immediately followed by a keyword without a space in between. This results in the highlighting engine failing to recognize the boundary between the number and the keyword.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/node-repl.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to Node.js REPL syntax highlighting and does not contain any rules specific to Python syntax highlighting.

#### `src/languages/python-repl.js`
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```
This file is related to Python REPL syntax highlighting but focuses on REPL prompts and does not contain rules for handling numbers and keywords in general Python code.

#### `src/languages/python.js`
```
src/languages/python.js
function: function_1
```
This file contains the relevant function `function_1` which defines the syntax highlighting rules for Python. The issue described is likely related to how numbers and keywords are defined and matched in the regular expressions within this function. Specifically, the rules for identifying numbers and keywords need to be examined to ensure they correctly handle cases where a number is immediately followed by a keyword.
