### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the syntax highlighting of TypeScript code using the `extends` keyword in generics. Specifically, the highlighting breaks after the `extends` keyword, causing subsequent code to be improperly highlighted. This issue is observed when using versions 10.3.0 and later of the Highlight.js library, while version 10.2.1 works correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely lies in the TypeScript language grammar definition within Highlight.js. The change between versions 10.2.1 and 10.3.0 may have introduced a modification that affects how the `extends` keyword in generics is handled. The commit mentioned in the GitHub problem description (`f5e24b9413265fe76ff24244e2642f47d722a8e4`) could be the source of the problem, as it is the only TypeScript-related change in that version range.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/javascript.js ---
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.

#### --- src/languages/typescript.js ---
```
src/languages/typescript.js
function: function_1
```
The `function_1` in this file is responsible for defining the TypeScript language grammar. The issue likely stems from how this function handles the `extends` keyword in generics. The commit mentioned in the GitHub problem description may have altered the grammar rules in a way that causes the highlighting to break.
