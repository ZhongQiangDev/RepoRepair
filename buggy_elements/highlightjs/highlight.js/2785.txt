### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that PHP variables are not being highlighted correctly. In the actual behavior image, the PHP variables (e.g., `$response`) are not visually distinguished from other parts of the code, making the code less readable. The expected behavior is for PHP variables to be highlighted, as shown in the expected behavior image.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for PHP in the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the rules for identifying and highlighting PHP variables may not be correctly implemented or may be missing. This would result in the variables not being recognized and thus not being highlighted.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/highlight.js`
This file contains the core initialization and extension point for the Highlight.js library. While it sets up global variables and defines utility functions, it does not directly define language-specific highlighting rules. Therefore:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/javascript.js`
This file defines syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript and its variants. Since the issue is related to PHP, not JavaScript, this file is not relevant:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/php-template.js`
This file defines a custom syntax highlighting rule for PHP templates embedded within XML or HTML. While it handles PHP code within a specific context, it does not define the general PHP syntax highlighting rules:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### `src/languages/php.js`
This file defines the language definition for PHP, including rules for variables, preprocessor directives, strings, numbers, and keywords. The `VARIABLE` pattern is specifically responsible for matching PHP variables. Therefore, this file is highly relevant:
```
src/languages/php.js
function: function_1
```

#### `src/plugins/vue.js`
This file contains functions related to a Vue plugin for Highlight.js. It does not define language-specific highlighting rules and is not relevant to the PHP variable highlighting issue:
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

### Conclusion

The issue with PHP variable highlighting is most likely due to a problem in the `src/languages/php.js` file, specifically within the `function_1` function where the PHP language definition and variable highlighting rules are defined.
