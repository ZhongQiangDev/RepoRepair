### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the double hyphen flag (`--flag`) is not being highlighted correctly in PowerShell syntax highlighting, while the single hyphen flag (`-flag`) is highlighted correctly. The expected behavior is that both single and double hyphen flags should be highlighted appropriately.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting rules defined for PowerShell in the `powershell.js` file. Specifically, the regular expressions and patterns used to identify and highlight flags in PowerShell code may not be correctly configured to recognize double hyphen flags (`--flag`).

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### `src/languages/powershell.js`

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for PowerShell. The function `function_1` defines various patterns and rules to identify and highlight different elements of PowerShell code. To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the patterns and rules for flags include both single and double hyphen flags.

````
src/languages/powershell.js
function: function_1
````

### Relevant Functions/Classes to Inspect or Edit

1. ````
src/languages/powershell.js
function: function_1
````

### Explanation

- **`function_1` in `powershell.js`**: This function defines the syntax highlighting rules for PowerShell. We need to inspect and potentially modify the patterns and rules related to flags to ensure that both single (`-flag`) and double (`--flag`) hyphen flags are correctly identified and highlighted. This may involve updating the regular expressions used to match flags or adding new rules to handle double hyphen flags specifically.

No other files or functions are mentioned in the provided information, so the focus should be on the `function_1` in `powershell.js`.
