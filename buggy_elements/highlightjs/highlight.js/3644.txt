### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that multi-line comments in CMake, which are denoted by `#[[` and `]]`, are not being properly recognized as comments by the `highlight.js` library. Instead, they are being treated as single-line comments, which start with `#`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the fact that the `highlight.js` library's CMake language definition does not include a specific rule for multi-line comments. The current configuration only includes a rule for single-line comments using `hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE`, which matches comments that start with `#`. As a result, the multi-line comment syntax `#[[` and `]]` is not being recognized correctly.

### 3. Examine Each File One by One

#### --- src/languages/c.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/cmake.js ---
```
src/languages/cmake.js
function: function_1
```

The `function_1` in `cmake.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for the CMake language. The issue lies in the `contains` array, which currently only includes a rule for single-line comments (`hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE`). To fix the issue, a new rule for multi-line comments should be added.

#### --- src/languages/cpp.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/languages/ini.js ---
```
This file contains no relevant functions/classes.
```

#### --- src/lib/modes.js ---
```
src/lib/modes.js
function: function_3
```

The `function_3` (named `COMMENT`) in `modes.js` is responsible for creating a comment mode for syntax highlighting. This function can be used to define a new comment mode for the multi-line comments in CMake.

### Summary of Relevant Locations
