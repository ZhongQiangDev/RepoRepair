### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior involves the C++ code not being properly rendered or highlighted. Specifically, the code is not being highlighted with the expected syntax colors, as shown in the comparison between the expected and actual rendering images.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of the issue is likely related to the configuration of the syntax highlighting for C++ in the Highlight.js library. The problem could be due to:
- Incorrect or incomplete C++ language definition in the Highlight.js configuration.
- Issues with the `highlight` function call, such as incorrect language specification or parameters.
- Potential bugs or limitations in the Highlight.js library's handling of C++ syntax.

### 3. Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/languages/cpp.js
src/languages/c.js
tools/perf.js
types/index.d.ts
src/languages/csharp.js
```

- `src/languages/cpp.js`: This file contains the C++ language definition for syntax highlighting. It is the most critical file to check for any issues related to C++ syntax highlighting.
- `src/languages/c.js`: This file contains the C language definition, which is closely related to C++. Any issues in the base C definition could affect C++.
- `tools/perf.js`: This file includes functions for testing and benchmarking syntax highlighting. It might be useful for diagnosing performance or functionality issues.
- `types/index.d.ts`: This file contains TypeScript type definitions for the Highlight.js library. Incorrect types could lead to issues in the configuration or usage of the library.
- `src/languages/csharp.js`: While not directly related to C++, this file might provide insights into how other C-like languages are configured, which could be useful for comparison.
