1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that when both bold and italic formatting (using three asterisks `***`) is applied to a piece of text, it causes the rest of the document to be rendered as bold and italic, ignoring the closing bold/italic characters. This results in incorrect formatting for the remainder of the document.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to how the markdown parser handles the closing sequence of three asterisks `***`. If the parser fails to correctly identify the end of the bold and italic formatting, it will continue applying the formatting to the rest of the text until it encounters another valid closing sequence or the end of the document.
