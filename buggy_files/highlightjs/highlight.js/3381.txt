1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the Python identifier `_undef` is incorrectly highlighted as if it contains the keyword `def`. Specifically, the part `_un` is highlighted normally, but `def` is highlighted as a keyword, which is incorrect since `_undef` is a single identifier.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the Python syntax highlighting configuration in Highlight.js. The configuration might be set up in a way that it incorrectly identifies `def` as a standalone keyword even when it is part of a larger identifier. This could be due to a regex pattern that matches `def` as a keyword without considering the context of the full identifier.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/languages/python.js
   src/lib/regex.js
   src/lib/modes.js
   tools/perf.js
   types/index.d.ts
   ```

   - `src/languages/python.js`: This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for Python, including the definition of keywords and patterns. It is the most relevant file as it directly defines how Python code is highlighted.
   - `src/lib/regex.js`: This file contains utility functions for manipulating regular expressions, which are likely used in defining the patterns for highlighting keywords. Issues with regex construction could lead to the described behavior.
   - `src/lib/modes.js`: This file provides utility functions for defining and customizing syntax highlighting modes. It might contain logic that affects how keywords are matched within larger identifiers.
   - `tools/perf.js`: This file contains functions for testing and benchmarking the syntax highlighting performance. It might include tests that could help identify the issue.
   - `types/index.d.ts`: This file defines TypeScript types used throughout the Highlight.js codebase. While less directly related, it ensures type safety and could indirectly influence how the highlighting logic is implemented.
