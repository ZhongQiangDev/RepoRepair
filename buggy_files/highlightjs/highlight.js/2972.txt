### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that **highlight.js provides very limited support for Python Type Hints (PEP 484)**. Specifically, the current implementation does not properly highlight type annotations such as `Dict[int, Any]` or `List[str]` in Python code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is likely due to the existing Python syntax highlighting configuration in `highlight.js` not being updated to recognize and style Python Type Hints. The current configuration may only highlight basic Python syntax elements like keywords, strings, and comments, but lacks specific rules for type annotations introduced in PEP 484.

### 3. Related Files
To fix this issue, the following files are most relevant and should be edited:

```
src/languages/python.js
```
This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for Python. It needs to be updated to include rules for recognizing and highlighting Python Type Hints.

```
src/lib/modes.js
```
This file contains utility functions that can be used to create and customize syntax highlighting rules. It might be necessary to use or modify these utilities to properly handle type hints.

```
types/index.d.ts
```
This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces used in the Highlight.js system. If any new types or interfaces are needed to support type hints, they might be defined here.

```
src/highlight.js
```
This file contains the core initialization routine for the `highlight.js` library. While less likely, changes here might be necessary if the core functionality needs to be adjusted to support new highlighting rules.

```
tools/lib/language.js
```
This file provides core functionality for managing and processing programming language definitions. If the compilation or processing of the Python language definition needs to be adjusted, changes might be necessary here.
