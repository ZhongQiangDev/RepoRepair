1. **Wrong Behavior**: The function capture `&letter?/1` is not being highlighted correctly. Instead of being treated as a single unit, the `/` is causing the highlighting to break, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting for the rest of the code.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue likely stems from the syntax highlighting rules for Elixir in the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the regular expression or pattern matching rules for function captures (`&function_name/arity`) might not be properly defined, causing the `/` to be interpreted as the start of a division operator or another syntax element, rather than part of the function capture syntax.

3. **Related Files**:
```
src/languages/elixir.js
```

The `src/languages/elixir.js` file is the most relevant because it contains the syntax highlighting configuration for the Elixir language. The issue described is specific to Elixir's function capture syntax, so this file would need to be modified to correctly handle the `&function_name/arity` pattern.
