### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior in the `GitHub Problem Description` is that the CSS syntax highlighter incorrectly treats the closing parenthesis `)` within a string as the end of the string, causing improper highlighting. Specifically, the closing parenthesis within the URL string is being interpreted as the end of the string, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is likely related to how the CSS language definition in Highlight.js handles string delimiters and escape sequences. The current configuration may not properly account for parentheses within quoted strings, causing the highlighter to prematurely end the string when it encounters a closing parenthesis.
