1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `switch` statement is not being highlighted correctly in C++ code when using Highlight.js version 10.7.0 and later. Specifically, the `switch` keyword is not being highlighted in the same way as other control flow keywords like `if`, `while`, and `for`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely lies in the C++ language definition within Highlight.js. The `switch` keyword might not be included in the list of keywords that are highlighted as control flow statements. This could be due to a change in how keywords are categorized or highlighted in the newer versions of Highlight.js.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/languages/cpp.js
src/lib/modes.js
types/index.d.ts
src/languages/c.js
demo/demo.js
```

- `src/languages/cpp.js`: This file contains the language definition for C++ and is the most relevant as it directly defines how C++ keywords, including `switch`, should be highlighted.
- `src/lib/modes.js`: This file contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting modes, which could affect how keywords are recognized and highlighted.
- `types/index.d.ts`: This file defines TypeScript types used throughout the Highlight.js codebase, including types related to language definitions and highlighting modes.
- `src/languages/c.js`: This file contains the language definition for C, which is closely related to C++ and might share some highlighting rules.
- `demo/demo.js`: This file sets up the demo environment and might contain configurations or settings that affect how the highlighting is displayed.
