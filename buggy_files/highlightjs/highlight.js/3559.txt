### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the curly braces `{` and `}` in the Kotlin class inheritance context are highlighted with different colors. Specifically, the opening and closing braces of the `TABLE` and `TR` classes are highlighted differently, while they should be highlighted with the same color.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely lies in the syntax highlighting configuration for Kotlin in the Highlight.js library. The configuration may not be correctly identifying the opening and closing braces as part of the same block, leading to inconsistent highlighting. This could be due to how the `contains` array or specific modes for curly braces are defined in the Kotlin language configuration.

### 3. Related Files
The most relevant files to address this issue are:

```
src/languages/kotlin.js
```

This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for Kotlin. It defines the rules and patterns for highlighting various elements of Kotlin code, including keywords, strings, numbers, and punctuation like curly braces. Adjusting the rules for curly braces in this file should resolve the inconsistent highlighting issue.

Since the problem is specific to Kotlin syntax highlighting, no other files are as directly relevant. However, if the issue involves a broader problem with how Highlight.js handles block delimiters, the following files could also be relevant:

```
src/languages/lib/css-shared.js
```

This file contains shared modes for CSS-like syntax elements, which might influence how block delimiters are handled in general.

```
types/index.d.ts
```

This file defines types and interfaces used throughout the Highlight.js library. If there's a type-related issue affecting how block delimiters are processed, this file might need to be reviewed.

But the primary focus should be on `src/languages/kotlin.js`.
