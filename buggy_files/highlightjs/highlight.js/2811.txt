1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when a comment is placed on the same line as a decorator in Python code, the entire line is incorrectly highlighted with the `hljs-meta` class instead of properly distinguishing the decorator and the comment. The comment should be highlighted with the `hljs-comment` class.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause likely lies in the way the Python syntax highlighting configuration handles decorators and comments. The current configuration might be treating the entire line as a single entity (decorator + comment) and applying the `hljs-meta` class to it, instead of recognizing the comment separately and applying the appropriate `hljs-comment` class.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/languages/python.js
   src/lib/modes.js
   src/languages/python-repl.js
   src/plugins/vue.js
   ```

   - `src/languages/python.js`: This file contains the core syntax highlighting configuration for Python, including rules for decorators and comments. It is the most relevant file as it directly defines how Python syntax elements are highlighted.
   - `src/lib/modes.js`: This file contains utility functions like `COMMENT` that are used to define comment highlighting rules. It may be relevant if the issue is related to how comments are defined and applied.
   - `src/languages/python-repl.js`: This file configures syntax highlighting for Python REPL interactions. While not directly related to the decorator-comment issue, it might have related configurations that could influence the behavior.
   - `src/plugins/vue.js`: This file contains functions related to language detection and syntax highlighting integration. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how the highlighting is applied in a specific context or environment.
