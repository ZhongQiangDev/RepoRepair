1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the double hyphen (`--`) in PowerShell flags is not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, `--flag` is not highlighted as expected, while `-flag` is highlighted properly.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from the syntax highlighting rules defined for PowerShell in the Highlight.js library. The rules for recognizing and highlighting flags with a single hyphen (`-`) are working correctly, but the rules for double hyphen (`--`) flags are either missing or incorrectly defined.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   - The most relevant file is the one that defines the syntax highlighting rules for PowerShell. This file should contain the rules for recognizing and highlighting flags with both single and double hyphens.

```
src/languages/powershell.js
```

This file is the most important as it directly defines the syntax highlighting rules for PowerShell, including the rules for flags with single and double hyphens. If the issue is with the highlighting of double hyphen flags, this file would need to be modified to include or correct the rules for double hyphen flags.
