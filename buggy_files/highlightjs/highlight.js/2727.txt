### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that member functions within ES6 classes are not being highlighted correctly when using `highlight.js` in a React application with `marked`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely stems from the configuration of `highlight.js` not properly recognizing and highlighting ES6 class member functions. This could be due to:
- The `highlight.js` configuration not being set up to handle ES6 syntax specifically.
- The `marked` library not passing the code in a way that `highlight.js` can correctly interpret ES6 class syntax.
- The `highlight.js` JavaScript language definition not including rules for ES6 class member functions.

### 3. Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/languages/javascript.js
src/plugins/vue.js
tools/lib/language.js
types/index.d.ts
src/languages/typescript.js
```

- `src/languages/javascript.js`: This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript, including ES6 features. It is crucial to ensure that ES6 class member functions are correctly highlighted.
- `src/plugins/vue.js`: This file contains the integration logic for using `highlight.js` within a Vue.js environment, which might be relevant if the issue is related to how the library is being used in a React context.
- `tools/lib/language.js`: This file handles the compilation and management of language definitions, which could affect how the JavaScript language definition is processed.
- `types/index.d.ts`: This file contains TypeScript type definitions that might be relevant if there are type-related issues affecting the highlighting.
- `src/languages/typescript.js`: Although the issue is with JavaScript, this file might provide insights into how ES6 features are handled in a similar context, as TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
