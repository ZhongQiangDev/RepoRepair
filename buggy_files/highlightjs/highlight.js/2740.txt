### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `highlight.js` library incorrectly breaking the syntax highlighting when it encounters string escape sequences in SQL code. Specifically, the highlighting fails after a string escape sequence at the end of a dynamic SQL statement.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how `highlight.js` handles string literals and escape sequences within SQL code. The library may not be properly recognizing the escape sequences within the string, causing it to misinterpret the subsequent code as part of the string literal. This misinterpretation leads to incorrect highlighting and potentially disrupts the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code block.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause are those that define the SQL language configuration and the core highlighting logic in `highlight.js`. Here are the most relevant files, ordered by importance:

```
src/languages/sql.js
src/highlight.js
src/languages/tsql.js
tools/lib/language.js
src/plugins/vue.js
```

- `src/languages/sql.js`: This file defines the SQL language configuration, including how string literals and escape sequences are handled. It is the most directly related to the issue.
- `src/highlight.js`: This file contains the core logic for syntax highlighting in `highlight.js`. It is crucial for understanding how the library processes code blocks and applies highlighting rules.
- `src/languages/tsql.js`: This file defines the T-SQL language configuration, which may also be relevant if the issue is specific to T-SQL syntax.
- `tools/lib/language.js`: This file handles language compilation and management, which could be relevant if there are issues with how the SQL language definition is being compiled or loaded.
- `src/plugins/vue.js`: This file contains Vue-specific integration logic, which might be relevant if the issue is related to how `highlight.js` is being used within a Vue application.
