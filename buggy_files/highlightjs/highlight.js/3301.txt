### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that inline comments in CSS code are not being highlighted correctly when using the `highlightAll` API in Highlight.js version 10.6.0 and later. Specifically, the inline comment `/* inline comment */` within the `width` property is not being highlighted as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The issue likely stems from changes in how the `highlightAll` API processes CSS comments in version 10.6.0. The `highlightAll` function may not be correctly identifying or applying the appropriate highlighting rules for inline comments within property values. This could be due to a regression in the CSS language definition or a change in how the `highlightAll` function interacts with language-specific rules.

### 3. Related Files
The following files are most related to the cause of the issue, ordered by importance:

```
src/languages/css.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/highlight.js
src/languages/lib/css-shared.js
types/index.d.ts
```

- `src/languages/css.js`: This file contains the CSS language definition and the specific rules for highlighting CSS syntax, including comments. It is the primary file responsible for defining how CSS code should be highlighted.
- `src/lib/modes.js`: This file contains utility functions like `COMMENT` that are used to define comment highlighting rules. Changes here could affect how comments are processed across different languages, including CSS.
- `src/highlight.js`: This is the core file of Highlight.js that initializes and configures the library. Issues with the `highlightAll` function could originate here.
- `src/languages/lib/css-shared.js`: This file contains shared CSS modes that are used by the CSS language definition. It includes rules for highlighting CSS-specific constructs like colors, numbers, and comments.
- `types/index.d.ts`: This file defines TypeScript types for Highlight.js, including types related to language definitions and highlighting modes. While less directly related, it ensures type safety and could be relevant if there are type-related issues affecting the highlighting process.
