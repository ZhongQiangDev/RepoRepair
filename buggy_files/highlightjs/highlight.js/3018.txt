1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that `BigInt` is not being highlighted as a built-in type in the same way `Number` is. Instead, it is being highlighted as a string.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the `BigInt` keyword not being included in the list of built-in types or keywords for the JavaScript language definition in Highlight.js. This results in the library not recognizing `BigInt` as a built-in type and instead treating it as a string.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/languages/javascript.js
   src/highlight.js
   types/index.d.ts
   src/languages/typescript.js
   src/languages/coffeescript.js
   ```

   - `src/languages/javascript.js`: This file contains the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript, where the `BigInt` keyword should be defined as a built-in type.
   - `src/highlight.js`: This file contains the core initialization routine for Highlight.js, which manages language definitions and configurations.
   - `types/index.d.ts`: This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces used in Highlight.js, which might include definitions for built-in types.
   - `src/languages/typescript.js`: This file configures syntax highlighting for TypeScript, which extends JavaScript and might also need to handle `BigInt`.
   - `src/languages/coffeescript.js`: This file configures syntax highlighting for CoffeeScript, which compiles to JavaScript and might also need to handle `BigInt` if it's used in CoffeeScript code.
