1. **Identify the Wrong Behavior:**
   The wrong behavior involves the syntax highlighter incorrectly identifying the right-hand side of the arrow function (`=>`) as a title instead of recognizing it as a variable or expression. This results in incorrect syntax highlighting, as shown in the provided images.

2. **Analyze the Cause:**
   The issue likely stems from the PHP syntax highlighting configuration in Highlight.js. The highlighter may be misinterpreting the arrow function syntax, specifically the `=>` operator, as indicating a title or label rather than recognizing it as part of an anonymous function definition. This misinterpretation could be due to the configuration not properly handling the new PHP arrow function syntax introduced in PHP 7.4.

3. **Find Related Files:**
   The most relevant files to address this issue are those that define the PHP syntax highlighting rules. These files need to be updated to correctly handle the arrow function syntax.
