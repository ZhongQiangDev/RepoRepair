1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that an empty block comment (`/**/`) in Dart code breaks the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code. The expected behavior is that the code should remain properly highlighted even when an empty block comment is present.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the Dart syntax highlighting configuration handles block comments. Specifically, the configuration might not properly handle empty block comments, causing it to misinterpret the subsequent code as part of the comment or failing to reset the highlighting state correctly after the comment.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   - The most relevant files would be those that define the Dart language configuration and handle comment syntax.

```
src/languages/dart.js
src/lib/modes.js
types/index.d.ts
```

- `src/languages/dart.js`: This file contains the Dart language configuration, including rules for comments. It is the primary file where the issue likely resides.
- `src/lib/modes.js`: This file contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting modes, including comments. It may contain functions that are used by the Dart configuration.
- `types/index.d.ts`: This file defines TypeScript types used in the syntax highlighting system. While less directly related, it ensures type safety and proper handling of syntax modes, which could indirectly affect the issue.
