### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves incorrect syntax highlighting for TypeScript code that uses generics with the `extends` keyword. Specifically, the highlighting breaks after encountering the `extends` keyword, causing subsequent code to be improperly highlighted.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the TypeScript language definition in Highlight.js handles the `extends` keyword in the context of generics. The problem may be related to how the `extends` keyword is matched and how the highlighting engine processes the subsequent code. The change between versions 10.2.1 and 10.3.0 suggests that a modification in the TypeScript language definition or the core highlighting logic could have introduced this regression.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/languages/typescript.js
src/highlight.js
types/index.d.ts
tools/perf.js
src/languages/javascript.js
```

- `src/languages/typescript.js`: This file contains the TypeScript language definition and is directly responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for TypeScript. It is the most likely place where the issue originates.
- `src/highlight.js`: This file contains the core logic for syntax highlighting in Highlight.js. Any changes here could affect how the TypeScript language definition is applied.
- `types/index.d.ts`: This file defines TypeScript types used within Highlight.js. If there were changes in type definitions related to language handling, it could impact the TypeScript highlighting.
- `tools/perf.js`: This file contains performance testing scripts. While not directly related to the highlighting logic, it could be useful for testing and reproducing the issue.
- `src/languages/javascript.js`: Since TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript, changes in the JavaScript language definition could also affect TypeScript highlighting.
