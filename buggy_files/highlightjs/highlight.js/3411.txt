1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that in the type parameter `OutT`, only the first component (`Out`) is highlighted differently from the second component (`T`). This suggests a problem with how type parameters are being parsed and highlighted in TypeScript.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely lies in how the TypeScript syntax highlighting rules are defined within the Highlight.js library. Specifically, the rules for recognizing and highlighting type parameters may not be correctly handling multi-component type parameters like `OutT`. The highlighting rules might be splitting the type parameter at the boundary between `Out` and `T`, causing them to be highlighted differently.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/languages/typescript.js
src/languages/javascript.js
types/index.d.ts
src/languages/lib/css-shared.js
src/languages/c.js
```

- `src/languages/typescript.js`: This file is directly responsible for configuring TypeScript syntax highlighting. It likely contains the rules that need to be adjusted to correctly handle type parameters like `OutT`.
- `src/languages/javascript.js`: Since TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript, the base JavaScript highlighting rules might also play a role in how TypeScript is highlighted.
- `types/index.d.ts`: This file contains TypeScript type definitions that could be relevant for defining the structure of the highlighting rules.
- `src/languages/lib/css-shared.js`: While not directly related to TypeScript, this file contains shared highlighting modes that might be used in the TypeScript configuration.
- `src/languages/c.js`: This file is included as a less important reference since C-like syntax highlighting rules might have some influence on how generic type parameters are handled.
