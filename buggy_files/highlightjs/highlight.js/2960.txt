1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the regex detection after the `m` keyword fails when an unescaped `/` is used as a delimiter in the regex pattern. For example, in the code `$d !~ m(/$);`, the regex `/` is not being recognized correctly, leading to improper highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how the Perl language definition in Highlight.js handles regex patterns. The current implementation may not be accounting for the flexibility of Perl's regex delimiters, which can be any character, not just `/`. This causes the regex pattern to be misinterpreted, leading to incorrect highlighting.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/languages/perl.js
   src/highlight.js
   types/index.d.ts
   tools/lib/language.js
   src/languages/javascript.js
   ```

   - `src/languages/perl.js`: This file contains the Perl language definition and is directly responsible for defining the regex patterns and highlighting rules for Perl. It is the most relevant file to address the issue.
   - `src/highlight.js`: This file contains the core logic of Highlight.js, including the `highlight` function and other essential functions that manage the highlighting process. It may contain logic that affects how regex patterns are processed.
   - `types/index.d.ts`: This file defines TypeScript types and interfaces used throughout the Highlight.js library. It may contain types related to regex patterns and highlighting rules that could influence the behavior.
   - `tools/lib/language.js`: This file provides utilities for compiling and managing language definitions. It may contain logic that affects how language-specific rules are compiled and applied.
   - `src/languages/javascript.js`: While not directly related to Perl, this file contains the JavaScript language definition, which shares some similarities with Perl in terms of regex handling. It may provide insights or solutions that can be applied to the Perl definition.
