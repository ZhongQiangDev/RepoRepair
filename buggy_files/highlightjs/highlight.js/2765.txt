1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the Handlebars syntax highlighting is not correctly distinguishing between values and keywords, particularly in the context of block `if` and `else` statements. The values and keywords are not highlighted distinctly, and the values are not highlighted consistently.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the Handlebars syntax highlighting configuration not properly recognizing and differentiating between the `if` and `else` keywords, as well as the values within the block. This could be due to insufficient or incorrect regular expressions for matching these elements, or a lack of specific highlighting rules for the `else if` construct.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/languages/handlebars.js
src/languages/htmlbars.js
src/plugins/vue.js
src/languages/js.js
src/languages/css.js
```

- `src/languages/handlebars.js`: This file is directly responsible for configuring the syntax highlighting for Handlebars templates. It defines the rules and patterns for highlighting various elements within Handlebars syntax, so it is the most relevant file to address the issue.
- `src/languages/htmlbars.js`: This file adapts the Handlebars syntax highlighting for HTMLbars, which is closely related to Handlebars. It may contain relevant configurations or adjustments that could inform changes needed for Handlebars.
- `src/plugins/vue.js`: This file contains functions related to syntax highlighting within a Vue.js environment. While not directly related to Handlebars, it may provide insights into how similar templating languages are handled and could offer useful patterns or utilities.
- `src/languages/js.js`: Since Handlebars templates often contain JavaScript expressions, the JavaScript syntax highlighting configuration might influence how Handlebars code is highlighted. Ensuring proper JavaScript highlighting could indirectly improve Handlebars highlighting.
- `src/languages/css.js`: Handlebars templates can also include CSS, so ensuring proper CSS highlighting might be relevant if CSS is embedded within the templates.
