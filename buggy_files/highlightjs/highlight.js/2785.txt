1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that PHP variables are not being highlighted correctly. In the provided images, the variable `$response` is not highlighted as a variable, which makes the code less readable.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely due to the PHP language definition in the Highlight.js library not properly identifying and highlighting PHP variables. This could be due to missing or incorrect patterns for variable detection in the PHP language configuration.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   - The most relevant files would be those that define the PHP language syntax highlighting rules.

```
src/languages/php.js
src/highlight.js
src/languages/php-template.js
src/plugins/vue.js
src/languages/javascript.js
```

- `src/languages/php.js`: This file contains the core configuration for PHP syntax highlighting and is the most relevant for fixing the issue.
- `src/highlight.js`: This is the core initialization file of Highlight.js and might contain general configurations that could affect language-specific highlighting.
- `src/languages/php-template.js`: This file handles PHP code embedded within templates and might have related configurations.
- `src/plugins/vue.js`: If the issue is occurring in a Vue.js context, this file might have relevant configurations for language detection and highlighting.
- `src/languages/javascript.js`: While not directly related to PHP, it might have some shared configurations or patterns that could influence the highlighting behavior.
