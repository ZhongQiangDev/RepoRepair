1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that multi-line comments in CMake, specifically those enclosed in `#[[` and `]]`, are not being properly recognized as comments by Highlight.js. Instead, they are being treated as single-line comments starting with `#`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the current configuration for CMake syntax highlighting in Highlight.js not properly defining a mode for multi-line comments that start with `#[[` and end with `]]`. The existing configuration might only recognize single-line comments starting with `#`.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/languages/cmake.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/languages/c.js
src/languages/cpp.js
src/languages/ini.js
```

- `src/languages/cmake.js`: This file directly defines the syntax highlighting rules for CMake. It is the most relevant file as it needs to be updated to correctly handle multi-line comments.
- `src/lib/modes.js`: This file contains utility functions for defining syntax highlighting modes, which might be useful for creating a new mode for CMake's multi-line comments.
- `src/languages/c.js`: CMake shares some syntax similarities with C, so this file might provide useful patterns or modes for reference.
- `src/languages/cpp.js`: CMake also shares similarities with C++, and this file might offer additional insights into handling comments.
- `src/languages/ini.js`: While not directly related, this file shows how other languages handle multi-line comments, which could provide additional context.
