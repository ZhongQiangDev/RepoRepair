### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when the `language-php` class is added to a code element, an extra `php` tag is added to the highlighted code. This results in incorrect syntax highlighting and an unexpected additional tag in the output.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely stems from how the PHP language definition is configured within Highlight.js. Specifically, the PHP language definition might be inadvertently adding an extra `php` tag during the highlighting process. This could be due to incorrect configuration of the language rules, particularly in how it handles the opening and closing PHP tags (`<?php` and `?>`).

### 3. Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/languages/php.js
src/languages/php-template.js
src/lib/utils.js
src/highlight.js
demo/demo.js
```

- `src/languages/php.js`: This file contains the core configuration for PHP syntax highlighting. It defines the rules and patterns for identifying PHP code elements, and any issues with the PHP tag handling would likely be found here.
- `src/languages/php-template.js`: This file handles PHP code embedded within XML/HTML templates. If the issue involves PHP code within templates, this file might be relevant.
- `src/lib/utils.js`: This file contains utility functions used throughout Highlight.js, including functions for HTML escaping and stream merging. If there's an issue with how the highlighted code is being processed or rendered, this file could be involved.
- `src/highlight.js`: This is the main Highlight.js file that orchestrates the highlighting process. If there's a broader issue with how language definitions are applied, this file might be relevant.
- `demo/demo.js`: This file sets up the demo environment and might contain configurations or behaviors specific to the demo that could influence the highlighting process.
