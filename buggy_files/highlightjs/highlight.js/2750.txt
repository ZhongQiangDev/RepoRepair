1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the syntax highlighter incorrectly interprets the right curly brace (`}`) inside a template literal expression as the end of the expression. This causes the rest of the expression to be highlighted as a string, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to how the syntax highlighter handles template literals and their embedded expressions. Specifically, the highlighter may not be correctly parsing nested curly braces within template literals, leading it to prematurely end the expression when it encounters a `}`.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/languages/javascript.js
src/lib/modes.js
src/languages/typescript.js
src/languages/css.js
src/languages/htmlbars.js
```

- `src/languages/javascript.js`: This file is directly responsible for configuring syntax highlighting for JavaScript, including template literals and expressions. It is the most relevant file for addressing the issue.
- `src/lib/modes.js`: This file contains utility functions for defining and customizing syntax highlighting rules, which may be relevant for handling nested expressions and curly braces.
- `src/languages/typescript.js`: Since TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript, this file may also be relevant if the issue affects TypeScript as well.
- `src/languages/css.js`: The issue involves CSS-in-JS, so this file may be relevant for handling CSS-specific syntax within template literals.
- `src/languages/htmlbars.js`: This file handles Handlebars templates, which may have similar syntax highlighting challenges with nested expressions.
