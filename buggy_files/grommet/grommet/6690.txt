1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is related to color contrast violations in the `Form/AggregateValidation` component. The error message indicates that the text color (`#FF4040`) does not have sufficient contrast against the background color (`#ffffff`), failing to meet the WCAG 2 AA contrast ratio threshold.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the incorrect color values being applied to the text and background elements within the `Form/AggregateValidation` component. The specific color values (`#FF4040` for text and `#ffffff` for background) do not meet the required contrast ratio, leading to accessibility issues.
