1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the search input within the `Select` component appears very small in Safari, and padding is being ignored. This is likely due to Safari's default styling for `<input type='search'>` elements, which can override custom padding styles.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that Safari applies its own `-webkit-appearance` styles to `<input type='search'>` elements, which can override custom CSS properties like padding. To fix this, the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` style needs to be applied to the search input to ensure it behaves like a regular text input and respects custom padding.

src/js/themes/dark.js
```

- `src/js/components/Select/Select.js`: This file contains the main `Select` component where the search input is likely defined. It needs to be updated to include the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` style.
- `src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js`: This file may contain additional styling or logic related to the `Select` component, which could also need adjustments.
- `src/js/components/TextInput/StyledTextInput.js`: This file contains styling utilities for text inputs, which might be used by the `Select` component and could benefit from the `-webkit-appearance` fix.
- `src/js/utils/styles.js`: This file contains general styling utilities that might be used to apply consistent styles across components, including the `-webkit-appearance` fix.
- `src/js/themes/dark.js`: This file contains theme-specific styles that might need to be updated to ensure the `-webkit-appearance` fix is applied consistently across themes.
