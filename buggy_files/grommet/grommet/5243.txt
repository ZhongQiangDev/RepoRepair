1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the background color specified for the checked radio button is being applied to all radio buttons instead of just the one that is checked.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how the background color is being applied in the styling logic. The styling for the checked state might not be correctly scoped or conditional, causing it to affect all radio buttons instead of just the checked one. This could be due to incorrect CSS selectors, missing conditional logic, or incorrect theme property usage.
