1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `Meter` component with `type="circle"` is not rendering all the data points as expected. Instead of displaying all segments, it only shows the last segment, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how the `Meter` component handles the `values` prop when rendering a circular meter. It seems that the logic for rendering multiple segments in a circular meter might have changed or broken in version `2.25.0`, causing only the last value to be rendered.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   Based on the provided repository information, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

   ```
   src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js
   src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js
   src/js/components/Meter/utils.js
   src/js/components/Meter/stories/Circle.js
   src/js/components/Meter/stories/VerticalBarMultiple.js
   ```

   - `src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js`: This file directly handles the rendering of circular meters and is likely where the issue lies.
   - `src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js`: This file contains the main logic for the `Meter` component and may contain the logic for handling different types of meters.
   - `src/js/components/Meter/utils.js`: This file contains utility functions that might be used in rendering the meter segments.
   - `src/js/components/Meter/stories/Circle.js`: This file contains a story for the circular meter, which can be used to test and debug the issue.
   - `src/js/components/Meter/stories/VerticalBarMultiple.js`: This file contains a story for a meter with multiple values, which might provide additional context for handling multiple segments.
