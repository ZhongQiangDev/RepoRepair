1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that when the `onOrder` property is used in conjunction with the `action` property in a `List` component, the action button does not align properly with the rest of the list items. Instead, it spans the entire width of the row, which is not the expected behavior.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how the `onOrder` property affects the layout of the list items. When `onOrder` is used, it may be altering the flex or grid layout of the list items, causing the action button to stretch across the entire row. This could be due to CSS rules that are applied when `onOrder` is set, which override the default styling for the action button.
