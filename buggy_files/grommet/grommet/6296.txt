1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the heading within the `PageHeader` component overflows instead of wrapping when the text is too long. This causes the heading to collide with other content on the page.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The overflow issue likely stems from the `PageHeader` component not applying the appropriate CSS properties to ensure text wrapping. Specifically, the `white-space` property might be set to `nowrap`, or there may be missing properties like `word-wrap` or `word-break` that would allow the text to break and wrap properly.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/js/components/PageHeader/PageHeader.js
src/js/components/PageHeader/stories/Custom.js
src/js/components/PageHeader/stories/Responsive.js
src/js/components/PageHeader/stories/Size.js
src/js/components/PageHeader/stories/CustomThemed/LeftColumn.js
```

These files are likely the most relevant because:
- `PageHeader.js` is the main implementation of the `PageHeader` component, where the core styling and behavior are defined.
- `Custom.js`, `Responsive.js`, and `Size.js` are story files that demonstrate different configurations and use cases of the `PageHeader`, which might include examples of how the heading should behave in various scenarios.
- `CustomThemed/LeftColumn.js` might contain additional styling or theming that could influence the behavior of the `PageHeader` component.
