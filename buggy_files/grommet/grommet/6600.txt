1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The current implementation of the `DataFilters` component uses a `drop` prop that causes the filters to appear in a dropdown menu. This can lead to overflow issues when there are many filters, as shown in the second image. The desired behavior is to have a `layer` prop that allows the filters to be displayed in a separate layer, providing more space and a cleaner layout.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue arises because the `DataFilters` component is currently configured to use a dropdown (`drop`) for displaying filters. This configuration does not provide enough space for a large number of filters, leading to overflow. To resolve this, the component needs to support a `layer` prop that will render the filters in a separate layer, similar to the first image.
