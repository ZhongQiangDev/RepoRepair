1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `Name` (text "File log level") and the `value` (the `Select` component with options like "Debug", "Info", etc.) are not vertically aligned. The `Name` is positioned higher than the `value`, and the user wants them to be horizontally centered.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The misalignment is likely due to the styling or layout properties applied to the `NameValuePair` component. The `valueProps` property is set to `{ width: "auto", align: "start" }`, which might not be sufficient to ensure vertical alignment. The `NameValuePair` component might need additional styling or alignment properties to align the `Name` and `value` elements properly.
