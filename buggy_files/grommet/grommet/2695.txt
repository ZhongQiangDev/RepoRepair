### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the circle meter path animation is not smooth when the value changes. Instead, it exhibits a "weird animation" in Chrome, while there is no animation at all in the latest versions of Firefox and Safari.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from the CSS transition applied to the SVG path of the circle meter. The `transition: all 300ms` is causing unexpected behavior in Chrome, likely due to how Chrome handles transitions on SVG paths. The lack of animation in Firefox and Safari suggests that these browsers may not be applying the transition at all, or they handle it differently.

```

**Explanation:**

- `src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js`: This file contains the `Circle` component, which is responsible for rendering the circular meter. It likely applies the SVG path and the transition that is causing the issue.
  
- `src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js`: This file contains dynamic styling functions that may be responsible for applying the `transition` property to the SVG path. Adjusting the transition logic here could resolve the animation issue.

- `src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js`: This file contains the `Meter` component, which manages the rendering of both bar and circle meters. It may contain logic related to the animation and could be involved in the issue.

- `src/js/components/Meter/meter.stories.js`: This file contains storybook stories for the meter components. While it may not directly cause the issue, it can be used to test and verify the fix.

- `src/js/utils/graphics.js`: This file contains utility functions for generating SVG paths and arcs. If the issue is related to how the SVG path is generated, this file may need to be reviewed.
