### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a required field is dynamically removed from a form (by unchecking a checkbox), the form still reports as invalid even though all other fields are valid. This suggests that the form validation logic is not correctly updating when fields are dynamically added or removed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the form's validation state is managed. When a field is dynamically removed, the form's validation logic may not be properly updating its internal state to reflect the removal of the field. This could be due to:
- The form not re-evaluating its validation rules after a field is removed.
- The form's state not being updated correctly when fields are dynamically added or removed.
- The validation logic not being triggered or not properly resetting when the checkbox is toggled.

- `src/js/components/Form/Form.js`: This file contains the core form management logic, including validation and state management. It is likely where the issue lies, as it handles the overall form state and validation.
- `src/js/components/Form/stories/DynamicFields.js`: This file demonstrates a form with dynamic fields, similar to the issue described. It may provide insights into how dynamic fields should be handled.
- `src/js/components/Form/stories/ValidateOnChange.js`: This file shows real-time validation, which is relevant to ensuring the form updates its validation state correctly when fields change.
- `src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js`: This file contains the logic for individual form fields, including how they interact with the form's validation system.
- `src/js/components/CheckBox/CheckBox.js`: This file contains the checkbox component, which is used to toggle the dynamic field. It may be relevant if the issue is related to how the checkbox interacts with the form.
