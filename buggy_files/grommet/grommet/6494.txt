1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `RangeInput` within a `FormField` is not centered and extends beyond the edge of the `FormField`. The expected behavior is for the `RangeInput` to be centered and contained within the `FormField`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from CSS styling issues related to alignment and sizing. The `RangeInput` might have incorrect padding, margin, or width settings that cause it to extend beyond the `FormField`. Additionally, the `FormField` might not be properly configured to center its child components.
