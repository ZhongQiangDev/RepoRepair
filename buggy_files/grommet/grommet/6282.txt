1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that when sorting a column in a data table, if any item in the table has a property set to `null` or `undefined`, the sorting does not work as expected. The expected behavior is that `null` or `undefined` properties should be treated as empty strings.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The sorting logic in the data table likely does not handle `null` or `undefined` values correctly. When comparing values during sorting, it may encounter an error or unexpected behavior when it encounters these values, leading to incorrect sorting results.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Sort.js
```

- `src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js`: This file contains the `Sorter` component, which is responsible for handling the sorting logic for columns in the data table. It is likely where the sorting behavior is defined and needs to be adjusted to handle `null` or `undefined` values correctly.
- `src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js`: This file contains utility functions for building and managing the state of the data table, including sorting. It may contain functions that need to be updated to handle `null` or `undefined` values.
- `src/js/components/DataTable/Cell.js`: This file handles the rendering of individual cells in the data table. While it may not directly handle sorting, it could be relevant if the cell rendering logic needs to be adjusted to handle `null` or `undefined` values.
- `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`: This file contains the main `DataTable` component, which manages the overall state and behavior of the data table. It may contain higher-level logic that needs to be updated to handle sorting with `null` or `undefined` values.
- `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Sort.js`: This file contains a story for the `Sort` component, which demonstrates sorting functionality. It may be useful for testing and verifying the fix for handling `null` or `undefined` values during sorting.
