1. **Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description:**
   The issue described is that users can select a date from the previous month that falls outside the specified bounds of the `DateInput` calendar. Specifically, the screenshot shows that June 30, 2020, is selectable even though the bounds are set to `['2020-07-01', '2020-07-31']`.

2. **Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how the `DateInput` component handles date selection and validation against the specified bounds. The component may not be correctly disabling or preventing the selection of dates that fall outside the defined range. This could be due to an issue in the logic that checks if a date is within the bounds or in the rendering of the calendar where it allows selection of out-of-bounds dates.
