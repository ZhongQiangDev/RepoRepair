1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The problem description indicates that there is a missing `DataTableGroup` component. The current implementation lacks a dedicated component for selecting the `groupBy` value for a `DataTable`, which would allow users to dynamically group data by different properties.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is the absence of a specific UI component (`DataTableGroup`) that would provide a user interface for selecting the `groupBy` property. This missing component prevents users from easily changing the grouping criteria for the `DataTable`, which is a common requirement for data visualization and analysis.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/js/components/Data/Data.js
   src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
   src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Grouped.js
   src/js/components/DataTable/stories/ControlledGrouped.js
   src/js/components/Data/stories/Controlled.js
   ```

   - `src/js/components/Data/Data.js`: This file contains the `Data` component, which manages and displays data with features like filtering, searching, and customizable views. It is relevant because the missing `DataTableGroup` component would likely integrate with this component to provide grouping functionality.
   - `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`: This file contains the main `DataTable` component, which is responsible for rendering tabular data. It is crucial because the `DataTableGroup` component would need to interact with this component to apply the selected grouping.
   - `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/Grouped.js`: This file contains a story for a grouped `DataTable`, which demonstrates how data can be grouped. It is relevant as it shows the desired behavior that the `DataTableGroup` component would enable.
   - `src/js/components/DataTable/stories/ControlledGrouped.js`: This file contains a story for a controlled grouped `DataTable`, which shows how grouping can be managed with external state. It is relevant because it provides an example of how the `DataTableGroup` component could be integrated into a controlled setup.
   - `src/js/components/Data/stories/Controlled.js`: This file contains a story for a controlled `Data` component, which shows how data can be managed with external state. It is relevant because it provides an example of how the `DataTableGroup` component could be integrated into a controlled setup for data management.
