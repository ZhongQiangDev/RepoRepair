1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue occurs when using the `Box` component with both `border="between"` and `gap="10px"`. The component throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')`, indicating that there is an unexpected undefined value being accessed during the rendering process.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The error suggests that the `gap` property, when combined with `border="between"`, is causing a problem where a property is being accessed on an undefined object. This likely happens because the `gap` value is not being handled correctly in the context of `border="between"`, leading to an attempt to access a property on an undefined value.
