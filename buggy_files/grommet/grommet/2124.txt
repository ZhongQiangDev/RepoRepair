### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Calendar component does not display properly in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). The screenshot shows that the calendar days are not rendered correctly, with some days missing or improperly displayed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a combination of factors specific to IE11, such as:
- **CSS Compatibility**: IE11 may not support certain CSS properties or flexbox layouts used in the Calendar component.
- **JavaScript Compatibility**: There might be JavaScript features or polyfills that are not properly handled in IE11.
- **Styling Issues**: The `StyledCalendar.js` file may contain styles that are not compatible with IE11, leading to improper rendering of the calendar days.
