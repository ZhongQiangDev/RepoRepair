### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior is that when using browser navigation (back/forward buttons), the sorting arrows in the table headers do not update to reflect the sorting state stored in the URL. Specifically, the URL changes correctly, but the visual state of the sorting arrows does not update accordingly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the component responsible for rendering the sorting arrows is not re-rendering or updating its state when the URL changes due to browser navigation. This could be due to a few reasons:
- The component is not listening for URL changes.
- The state that controls the sorting arrows is not being updated when the URL changes.
- The component is not re-rendering when the URL changes.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js
src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js
src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js
src/js/components/DataTable/Body.js
```

### Explanation:

1. **`src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`**: This file contains the main `DataTable` component, which manages the overall state of the table, including sorting. It is likely responsible for handling URL changes and updating the table's state.

2. **`src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js`**: This file contains the `DataTable` header component, which includes the sorting arrows. It needs to update its state based on the URL changes to reflect the correct sorting direction.

3. **`src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js`**: This file contains the `Sorter` component, which handles the sorting logic and rendering of the sorting arrows. It needs to ensure that the arrows are updated when the URL changes.

4. **`src/js/components/DataTable/buildState.js`**: This file contains utility functions for building the state of the table, including sorting. It may need to be updated to handle URL changes and ensure the state is correctly reflected in the table.

5. **`src/js/components/DataTable/Body.js`**: This file contains the `Body` component, which renders the table rows. While it may not directly affect the sorting arrows, it is part of the overall table rendering and may need to be considered if the issue is related to re-rendering.
