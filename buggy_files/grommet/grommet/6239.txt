1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the underlines (indicating the active tab) do not stick to the bottom of the tab bar when the tab content is scrollable. Instead, the underlines remain at the top of the tab bar, which is not the expected behavior.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from a CSS or layout issue where the tab underlines are not correctly positioned relative to the tab bar when the content within the tab is scrollable. This could be due to incorrect styling or positioning properties applied to the tab components or their containers.
