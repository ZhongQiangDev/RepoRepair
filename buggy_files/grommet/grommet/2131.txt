1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the arrow icon for the Select component is not visible on a dark background. This suggests that the color of the arrow icon is not being adjusted appropriately for dark mode, leading to poor contrast and invisibility.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to the styling of the arrow icon within the Select component. The color of the arrow icon may not be dynamically adjusting based on the background color or theme.
