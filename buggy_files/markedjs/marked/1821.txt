1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the strikethrough markdown syntax (`~~text~~`) is not being rendered correctly. Instead of displaying the text with a strikethrough, the text is displayed without any formatting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from the markdown parser not recognizing or properly handling the strikethrough syntax. This could be due to:
   - The parser not having the correct rules to detect and process the `~~` syntax.
   - The renderer not having the appropriate method to convert the detected strikethrough tokens into HTML `<del>` tags.
   - Configuration issues where strikethrough support is disabled or not properly set up.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Renderer.js
src/marked.js
lib/marked.js
docs/demo/demo.js
```

- `src/Tokenizer.js`: This file contains the `del` function, which is responsible for detecting strikethrough text in markdown. If the `del` function is not correctly identifying the `~~` syntax, it would cause the issue.
- `src/Renderer.js`: This file contains the `del` function, which is responsible for rendering the detected strikethrough tokens into HTML `<del>` tags. If this function is not correctly rendering the strikethrough, it would cause the issue.
- `src/marked.js`: This file contains the main `marked` function, which orchestrates the parsing and rendering process. If there are configuration issues or missing options related to strikethrough support, they might be found here.
- `lib/marked.js`: This file contains the core functionality of the `marked` library, including the `Lexer` and `Parser` classes. If there are issues with the lexer or parser rules, they might be found here.
- `docs/demo/demo.js`: This file contains the demo application code, which sets up the markdown parsing and rendering environment. If there are configuration issues or missing options related to strikethrough support in the demo setup, they might be found here.
