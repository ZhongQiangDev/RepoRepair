1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that task lists are being rendered even when the `gfm: false` option is set. This means that the `[ ]` syntax for task lists is being interpreted as a task list instead of plain text.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The `gfm: false` option should disable GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions, including task lists. However, the current implementation seems to still recognize and render task lists even when GFM is disabled. This suggests that the logic for disabling GFM extensions is not properly applied to task lists.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Parser.js
src/Renderer.js
src/Lexer.js
src/defaults.js
```

- `src/Tokenizer.js`: This file contains the logic for tokenizing markdown elements, including task lists. The issue likely lies here where the tokenizer still recognizes task lists even when GFM is disabled.
- `src/Parser.js`: The parser processes the tokens generated by the tokenizer. It may need to be updated to ensure that task lists are not processed when GFM is disabled.
- `src/Renderer.js`: The renderer converts the parsed tokens into HTML. It should not render task lists as HTML when GFM is disabled.
- `src/Lexer.js`: The lexer tokenizes the markdown source into structured tokens. It may need to be adjusted to ensure that task lists are not tokenized when GFM is disabled.
- `src/defaults.js`: This file manages default configurations. It may need to ensure that the `gfm: false` option is properly applied to disable task lists.
