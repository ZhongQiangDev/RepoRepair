1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that when a fenced code block follows a list and contains blank lines, it is not correctly recognized as a code block. Instead, the blank lines cause the code block to be split into separate elements, disrupting the expected HTML output.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how the lexer or tokenizer handles blank lines within fenced code blocks that follow list items. The lexer may not properly recognize the fenced code block as a single unit when it encounters blank lines, leading to incorrect tokenization and subsequent rendering.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause:**
   ```
   src/Lexer.js
   src/Tokenizer.js
   lib/marked.esm.js
   src/marked.js
   docs/demo/demo.js
   ```

   - **src/Lexer.js**: This file contains the core logic for tokenizing markdown text, including handling block-level elements like lists and code blocks. The issue likely involves how the lexer processes blank lines within fenced code blocks.
   - **src/Tokenizer.js**: This file contains functions for parsing specific markdown elements, including fenced code blocks (`fences` function). The tokenizer needs to correctly handle blank lines within these blocks.
   - **lib/marked.esm.js**: This file includes the main `marked` library functions and classes, such as `Lexer` and `Parser`, which are responsible for the overall markdown parsing process.
   - **src/marked.js**: This file contains the core `marked` function and related utilities, which manage the parsing and rendering of markdown content. It may need adjustments to ensure correct handling of fenced code blocks.
   - **docs/demo/demo.js**: This file manages the demo application's UI and interactions, including processing and displaying markdown content. While less directly related to the core parsing logic, it may need updates to reflect changes in the parsing behavior.
