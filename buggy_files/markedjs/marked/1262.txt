### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the table in the markdown is not being rendered correctly by `Marked` version 0.4.0. Specifically, the table columns are not aligned properly, and the content is not displayed as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to be related to how `Marked` version 0.4.0 handles table rendering. The table syntax in the markdown is correct, but the renderer is not interpreting it as intended. This could be due to a bug in the `Marked` version being used or a configuration issue in how the markdown is being processed.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/marked.js
docs/demo/demo.js
```

### Explanation:

- **`lib/marked.js`**: This file contains the core implementation of the `marked` Markdown parsing library. Since the issue is related to table rendering, the problem might be in how `marked` processes and renders tables. Functions like `Parser`, `Renderer_1`, and `marked.walkTokens` are crucial for parsing and rendering Markdown content, including tables.

- **`docs/demo/demo.js`**: This file manages the user interface and interaction with the markdown editor. It includes functions that handle input changes, update the preview, and manage the rendering process. The issue might be related to how the markdown content is being passed to the `marked` library or how the rendered output is being displayed in the UI.

Since the issue is primarily related to the rendering of the table, the `lib/marked.js` file is the most important to investigate first. The `docs/demo/demo.js` file is also important as it manages the interaction between the user interface and the markdown processing. Other files in the repository may not be directly related to the table rendering issue.
