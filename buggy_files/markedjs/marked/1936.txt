### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that an empty space node appears in the last `list_item` of a list when using the `marked` lexer. This space node is not expected and causes an additional space to appear between the last list item and the following paragraph in the semantic tree.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how the `marked` lexer processes the end of a list and the transition to the next paragraph. Specifically, the lexer might be incorrectly identifying a space token after the last list item, which should not be part of the list item itself but rather a separator between the list and the following paragraph.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue, ordered by importance:

```
src/Lexer.js
src/Tokenizer.js
lib/marked.js
src/Renderer.js
src/helpers.js
```

- `src/Lexer.js`: This file contains the core logic for tokenizing markdown content into a structured token tree. The issue likely stems from how the lexer handles the end of a list and the transition to the next paragraph.
- `src/Tokenizer.js`: This file processes specific markdown elements like lists, and it might be responsible for incorrectly adding the space token to the last list item.
- `lib/marked.js`: This file contains the main `marked` function that orchestrates the parsing process. It might need adjustments to ensure the lexer and tokenizer work correctly together.
- `src/Renderer.js`: This file generates HTML from the token tree. While the issue is in the lexer, the renderer might need adjustments to handle the token tree correctly.
- `src/helpers.js`: This file contains utility functions that might be used by the lexer or tokenizer, such as `rtrim` for trimming trailing spaces. Adjustments here could help fix the issue.
