1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that when square brackets are escaped in the alt text of an image link (e.g., `\[Manny Pacquiao\]`), the image link does not render correctly. Instead of displaying the image, the alt text and link are shown as plain text.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how the markdown parser handles escaped characters within alt text. The parser may be interpreting the escaped square brackets as literal characters rather than as part of the alt text, leading to incorrect tokenization and rendering.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```

```

- `src/Lexer.js`: This file contains the core logic for tokenizing markdown into structured tokens. The issue may be related to how it processes inline tokens, particularly those involving escaped characters in alt text.
- `src/Tokenizer.js`: This file handles the parsing of specific markdown elements, including images. The problem could be in how it processes and escapes characters within image alt text.
- `src/Renderer.js`: This file is responsible for converting tokens into HTML. If the lexer or tokenizer incorrectly processes the alt text, the renderer might not receive the correct data to render the image properly.
- `lib/marked.js`: This file contains the main `marked` function, which orchestrates the parsing and rendering process. It might have settings or configurations that affect how escaped characters are handled.
- `docs/demo/demo.js`: This file manages the demo application's UI and markdown processing. While less directly related to the core parsing logic, it could provide context on how the issue manifests in a real-world scenario.
