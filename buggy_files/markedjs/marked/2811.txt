### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect parsing of strong (`**`) delimiters when they are followed closely by certain characters (like `!`, `。`, `！`, `M`) without a space. Specifically:

- When a strong delimiter (`**`) is followed by a character other than `[ .!,;]`, the strong delimiter fails to work correctly.
- This issue is particularly noticeable when there is a link inside the strong delimiter, followed closely by a character like `!`, `。`, `！`, or `M`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in how the `marked` library handles the parsing of strong delimiters and the subsequent characters. The library may be expecting a space after the strong delimiter to properly close it, which is why it fails when there is no space. Additionally, the handling of links within strong delimiters might be interfering with the parsing logic, especially when followed by certain characters.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause of this issue are:

```
src/marked.js
src/Parser.js
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Renderer.js
src/helpers.js
```

- `src/marked.js`: This file contains the core parsing logic of the `marked` library, including the `marked` function which handles the overall parsing process. It is crucial for understanding how the strong delimiters and links are processed.
- `src/Parser.js`: The `Parser` class is responsible for parsing tokens into structured output formats like HTML. It handles the rendering of strong delimiters and links, so any issues with their parsing would likely be found here.
- `src/Tokenizer.js`: The `Tokenizer` class converts markdown text into tokens. It is responsible for recognizing strong delimiters and links, so any issues with their tokenization would be found here.
- `src/Renderer.js`: The `Renderer` class converts markdown syntax into HTML. It handles the rendering of strong delimiters and links, so any issues with their rendering would be found here.
- `src/helpers.js`: This file contains utility functions that are used throughout the library, including functions for escaping characters and handling URLs. Any issues with character handling or URL sanitization could be found here.
