1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that lines containing only spaces are being removed from code blocks, even though they should be preserved. This affects the formatting and structure of the code within the code blocks, especially in cases where whitespace is significant.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause appears to be related to how the `marked` library processes whitespace in code blocks. Specifically, the `blockTokens` function in the lexer is likely removing lines with only spaces as part of its initial cleanup or normalization process. This removal is not desirable for code blocks where whitespace can be meaningful.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause:**

```
src/Lexer.js
lib/marked.js
src/Tokenizer.js
src/defaults.js
src/helpers.js
```

- `src/Lexer.js`: This file contains the `blockTokens` function, which is likely where the problematic whitespace removal occurs. It is the most critical file to address the issue.
- `lib/marked.js`: This file contains the main `marked` function that orchestrates the parsing process. It may need adjustments to ensure proper handling of whitespace in code blocks.
- `src/Tokenizer.js`: This file handles the tokenization of various markdown elements, including code blocks. It might need changes to preserve whitespace correctly.
- `src/defaults.js`: This file manages default options for the library. Adjusting default settings related to whitespace handling could be necessary.
- `src/helpers.js`: This file contains utility functions that might be used in the parsing process, such as `rtrim` or other string manipulation functions that could affect whitespace.
