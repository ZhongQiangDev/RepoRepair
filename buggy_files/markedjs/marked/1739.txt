1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that comments in the markdown text are not being properly hidden or ignored when rendered. Specifically, comments with the format `<!-- ... -->` are being displayed in the preview instead of being treated as hidden comments.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause likely lies in the markdown parsing and rendering process. The parser is not correctly identifying and ignoring HTML-style comments (`<!-- ... -->`). Instead, it is treating them as regular text and including them in the final HTML output.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/Tokenizer.js
src/Renderer.js
src/marked.js
lib/marked.js
src/defaults.js
```

- `src/Tokenizer.js`: This file is responsible for tokenizing the markdown input. It needs to correctly identify and handle HTML comments.
- `src/Renderer.js`: This file is responsible for rendering the tokens into HTML. It should ensure that HTML comments are not rendered as visible text.
- `src/marked.js`: This file contains the main markdown parsing function. It orchestrates the tokenization and rendering process and may need adjustments to handle comments correctly.
- `lib/marked.js`: This file also contains core parsing and rendering logic and may need to be updated to properly handle HTML comments.
- `src/defaults.js`: This file manages default settings. It might need to include options for handling HTML comments if such an option is missing.
