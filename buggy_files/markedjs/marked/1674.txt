1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is a crash when rendering an empty checkbox list item in markdown. The error message `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'type' of undefined` indicates that the code is attempting to access a property on an undefined object, likely during the rendering process of the empty checkbox.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The error suggests that the rendering logic for checkbox list items is not handling empty items correctly. Specifically, when an empty checkbox list item is encountered, the code expects a certain structure or property (`type`) that is not present, leading to the `TypeError`. This could be due to a missing check for the existence of the expected properties or an incorrect assumption about the structure of the token representing the empty checkbox.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/Renderer.js
src/Tokenizer.js
lib/marked.esm.js
src/Lexer.js
src/Parser.js
```

- `src/Renderer.js`: This file contains the `checkbox` function, which is responsible for generating the HTML for checkbox list items. It is likely where the error occurs when trying to access the `type` property of an undefined object.
- `src/Tokenizer.js`: This file handles the tokenization of markdown elements, including list items. It may need to be adjusted to ensure that empty checkbox list items are properly tokenized and passed to the renderer.
- `lib/marked.esm.js`: This file contains the core functionality of the `marked` library, including the `Lexer` and `Renderer` classes. It may need to be checked for any global settings or configurations that could affect the handling of empty list items.
- `src/Lexer.js`: This file is responsible for lexing the markdown source into tokens. It may need to be reviewed to ensure that empty checkbox list items are correctly identified and tokenized.
- `src/Parser.js`: This file processes the tokens generated by the lexer and passes them to the renderer. It may need to be checked to ensure that empty list items are handled correctly during the parsing process.
