### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when using the `revealjs` format with the `knitr` engine, the embedded code from an external file (`code.R`) is not displayed in the generated HTML output. Instead, the HTML output contains an empty block where the embedded code should be.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `knitr` engine processes the embedded code in the context of the `revealjs` format. The `knitr` engine is responsible for executing and rendering R code chunks, but it seems to fail to properly handle the embedded code when the `revealjs` format is specified. This could be due to differences in how `knitr` processes code chunks in different output formats or issues with the `embed` engine in the `revealjs` context.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`src/command/render/codetools.ts`**: This file contains functions related to code tools and processing embedded source code. The `readEmbeddedSource` function is particularly relevant as it handles the reading and processing of embedded code files. If there's an issue with how embedded code is being read or processed, this file would be a primary candidate for investigation.

2. **`src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts`**: This file contains the main function `revealjsFormat`, which sets up the Reveal.js presentation format. It includes various configurations and post-processing steps specific to Reveal.js. If there's a problem with how the `knitr` engine interacts with the Reveal.js format, this file would be crucial to examine.

3. **`src/core/knitr.ts`**: This file contains functions related to the `knitr` engine, including `knitrCapabilities` and other utilities for assessing and executing `knitr` code. If there's an issue with the `knitr` engine's compatibility with the `revealjs` format, this file would be important to check.

4. **`src/command/render/render.ts`**: This file contains the main rendering functions, including `renderPandoc`, which orchestrates the conversion of documents into the target format using Pandoc. If there's a problem with the rendering pipeline, this file would be relevant.

5. **`src/core/handlers/base.ts`**: This file contains functions for processing and handling different types of code cells, including the `cell` function, which processes individual code cells. If there's an issue with how code cells are being handled in the context of the `revealjs` format, this file could be relevant.
