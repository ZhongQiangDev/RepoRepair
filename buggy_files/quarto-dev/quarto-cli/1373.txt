### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `code-tools` menu does not show up when using a URL for the `source` option in the YAML front matter. Instead, it only works when `source: true` is specified.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `code-tools` feature handles the `source` option when it's a URL versus a boolean value. When `source: true` is used, the system recognizes it as a valid configuration and enables the `code-tools` menu. However, when a URL is provided, the system may not correctly interpret or process the URL as a valid source configuration, leading to the absence of the `code-tools` menu.

src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/hover.ts
src/project/project-context.ts
src/quarto-core/inspect.ts
```

**Explanation:**

- `src/command/render/codetools.ts`: This file likely contains the logic for handling `code-tools` configurations and rendering them in the output. It would be crucial in determining how the `source` option is processed.
  
- `src/core/handlers/base.ts`: This file may contain general handling logic for YAML configurations and metadata, which could influence how the `source` option is interpreted.

- `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/hover.ts`: This file might be involved in parsing and validating YAML configurations, including the `source` option. It could be where the URL is not being correctly recognized.

- `src/project/project-context.ts`: This file manages project configurations and contexts, which could affect how the `source` option is handled in the context of a project.

- `src/quarto-core/inspect.ts`: This file likely contains functions for inspecting and validating configurations, which could be relevant to ensuring the `source` option is correctly processed.
