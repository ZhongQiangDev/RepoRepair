1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the combination of `panel-tabset` and `nav-fill` does not render correctly in the newer version of Quarto (1.3.146). Instead of displaying the tabs side by side with equal width (as expected with `nav-fill`), the tabs are stacked vertically.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from changes in how `panel-tabset` and `nav-fill` are processed or styled in the newer version of Quarto. The `nav-fill` class is intended to make the tabs fill the available horizontal space evenly, but it seems that the CSS or HTML structure generated by Quarto is not applying this class correctly in the new version.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/command/render/layout.ts
   src/command/render/render-shared.ts
   src/core/css.ts
   src/project/types/website/website-navigation.ts
   src/resources/formats/html/tabby/js/tabby.js
   ```

   - `src/command/render/layout.ts`: This file likely contains the logic for handling layout-related classes and styles, including `nav-fill`.
   - `src/command/render/render-shared.ts`: This file may contain shared rendering functions that could affect how the `panel-tabset` and `nav-fill` are combined.
   - `src/core/css.ts`: This file deals with CSS processing and could be responsible for ensuring that the `nav-fill` class is applied correctly.
   - `src/project/types/website/website-navigation.ts`: This file might contain navigation-related configurations that could influence the rendering of tabsets.
   - `src/resources/formats/html/tabby/js/tabby.js`: This file contains the Tabby interface constructor, which is likely used for tabbed interfaces and could be involved in the rendering of `panel-tabset`.
