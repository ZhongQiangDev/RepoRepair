The GitHub problem description indicates that non-standard URLs with punctuation (like commas) display correctly inline in the blog post but fail to display in the image grid view. This suggests an issue with URL handling or parsing when rendering images in the grid view.

### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior is that images with non-standard URLs containing punctuation (e.g., commas) are not displayed in the image grid view, even though they display correctly within the blog post.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause likely lies in how URLs are processed or sanitized when rendering images in the grid view. The grid view might be applying stricter URL validation or escaping rules that break URLs with punctuation, whereas the inline display does not have these restrictions.

### 3. Find Related Files
Based on the provided repository information, here are the most relevant files, ordered by importance:

```
src/core/url.ts
src/core/image.ts
src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing-shared.ts
src/core/pandoc/pandoc-id.ts
src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/paths.ts
```

- `src/core/url.ts`: This file contains functions for URL normalization and validation, which could be affecting how URLs are processed in the grid view.
- `src/core/image.ts`: Contains functions for handling image content types and dimensions, which might be relevant for image rendering issues.
- `src/project/types/website/listing/website-listing-shared.ts`: This file includes functions for processing and rendering listings, which could include the grid view.
- `src/core/pandoc/pandoc-id.ts`: Contains functions for handling IDs and identifiers, which might be relevant if the issue involves URL encoding or decoding.
- `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/paths.ts`: Contains functions for path construction and manipulation, which could be relevant if the issue involves path handling.
