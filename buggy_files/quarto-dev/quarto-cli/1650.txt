1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue is that there is an extra blank line at the top of the code chunk when using `echo: true` or `echo: fenced` with Mermaid and Dot chunks.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The extra blank line appears because the `echo` option is causing the code chunk to be echoed in the output, but the formatting or processing of the echoed code is introducing an unintended blank line. This could be due to how the code chunk is being parsed, formatted, or inserted into the final document.
