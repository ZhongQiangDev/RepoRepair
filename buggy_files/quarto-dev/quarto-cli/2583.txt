1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that Markdown styling (such as superscript or italics) is not being applied to table captions in Quarto documents, while it works correctly for figure captions.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how Quarto processes table captions versus figure captions. Specifically, the Markdown syntax in table captions might not be parsed or rendered correctly, whereas figure captions are processed in a way that supports Markdown styling. This could be due to differences in how the caption text is handled or formatted during the rendering process.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/command/render/filters.ts
src/command/render/render.ts
src/command/render/render-shared.ts
src/core/pandoc/pandoc-formats.ts
src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/descriptions.ts
```

- `src/command/render/filters.ts`: This file likely contains the logic for processing and applying filters during rendering, which could include handling table captions.
- `src/command/render/render.ts`: This file orchestrates the rendering process and might contain the core logic for rendering different elements, including captions.
- `src/command/render/render-shared.ts`: This file contains shared functions used in rendering, which might include functions for handling captions and their formatting.
- `src/core/pandoc/pandoc-formats.ts`: This file deals with Pandoc formats and could contain settings or configurations that affect how captions are rendered.
- `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/descriptions.ts`: This file might handle descriptions and metadata, which could include processing and formatting of captions.
