1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the caption text inside the callout block is not being processed as markdown. Specifically, special characters like `%<-%` are not being escaped properly for LaTeX output, and markdown formatting (like `**strong**` and `` `code` ``) is not being applied to the caption text.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem arises because the caption text is being treated as plain text rather than markdown. The `pandoc.utils.stringify()` function is used to convert the caption content, which does not process markdown syntax. Additionally, the caption text is not being properly escaped for LaTeX output, leading to errors when special characters are present.
