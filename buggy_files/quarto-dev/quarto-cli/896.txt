### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior is that images are not being placed inside custom divs as expected. Instead, the images are being pushed outside the divs, disrupting the intended layout. This issue occurs in "Test A: custom block" and "Test C: outer div," but not in "Test B: columns."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the reveal.js format processes and renders custom divs and images. The problem may stem from the way the reveal.js post-processor handles the placement of images within custom HTML structures. Specifically, the post-processor might be incorrectly interpreting the custom divs and moving the images outside of them.

```

**Explanation:**

- **src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts**: This file contains functions like `revealHtmlPostprocessor`, which processes the HTML document for Reveal.js compatibility. It might be responsible for the incorrect placement of images outside custom divs.
  
- **src/core/html.ts**: This file provides utilities for managing HTML content, including placeholders and resource references. It could be involved in how images are handled within custom HTML structures.
  
- **src/core/render.ts**: This file includes functions for generating directory names for figures and other resources. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how resources are being referenced or managed.
  
- **src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/highlight/plugin.js**: This file contains functions for enhancing code blocks with syntax highlighting and line numbers. While not directly related to images, it might interact with the HTML post-processing that affects image placement.
  
- **src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/zoom/plugin.js**: This file provides zoom functionality for Reveal.js presentations. It might be indirectly related if the zoom functionality affects the layout or rendering of images within custom divs.
