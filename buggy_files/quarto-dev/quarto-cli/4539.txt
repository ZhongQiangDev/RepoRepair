### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect rendering of the table when a caption is added. Specifically, the table spanners are not being properly aligned or displayed, leading to an undesirable layout where the subheader spans the entire table width instead of just the relevant columns.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the table spanners are being processed and rendered when a caption is added. The spanners are meant to group columns under a subheader, but the presence of the caption seems to interfere with the spanner's layout. This could be due to CSS styling issues, improper HTML structure generation, or a combination of both.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/command/render/codetools.ts
src/core/pandoc/pandoc-partition.ts
src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts
src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/descriptions.ts
src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/hover.ts
```

These files are likely related to the issue because:

- `src/command/render/codetools.ts`: This file contains functions for generating and manipulating Pandoc nodes, which are used to create the table structure. Issues in how these nodes are generated could lead to improper spanner rendering.
- `src/core/pandoc/pandoc-partition.ts`: This file handles the partitioning of Pandoc documents, including the extraction of headings and other metadata. Problems in this file could affect how the table and its caption are processed.
- `src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts`: This file contains functions for generating Pandoc code, including tables. Issues in the table generation logic could cause the spanner layout problems.
- `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/descriptions.ts`: This file handles schema descriptions, which might be relevant if the issue is related to how the table schema is being interpreted or rendered.
- `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/hover.ts`: This file handles hover information, which might be relevant if the issue involves dynamic content or tooltips that interfere with the table layout.
