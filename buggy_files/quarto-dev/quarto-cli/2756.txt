1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the theorem headings are being included as items in the list, which is not the intended behavior. The theorem headings should be standalone headings, not part of the list.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the theorem and proof environments are being processed by the Lua filter. Specifically, the filter might be incorrectly interpreting the theorem headings as list items instead of standalone headings. This could be due to improper handling of the theorem environment's structure or a bug in the Lua filter that processes these environments.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/command/render/crossref.ts
   src/core/handlers/mermaid.ts
   src/core/pandoc/pandoc-partition.ts
   src/core/schema/validated-yaml.ts
   src/core/run/lua.ts
   ```

   - `src/command/render/crossref.ts`: This file likely contains the logic for handling cross-references and theorem environments, which could be where the issue lies.
   - `src/core/handlers/mermaid.ts`: This file might contain general handling logic for different types of content blocks, which could be relevant if the theorem handling is part of a broader content processing system.
   - `src/core/pandoc/pandoc-partition.ts`: This file deals with partitioning Pandoc content, which might be relevant if the issue is related to how content is being split or processed.
   - `src/core/schema/validated-yaml.ts`: This file might be involved in validating YAML configurations, which could be relevant if the issue is related to configuration settings affecting theorem handling.
   - `src/core/run/lua.ts`: This file might contain Lua-related logic that could be involved in running filters or processing content, which could be relevant if the issue is related to Lua filter execution.
