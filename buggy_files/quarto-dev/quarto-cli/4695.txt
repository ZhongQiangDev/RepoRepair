1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the links in the `index.qmd` file are not being resolved correctly when viewed on Confluence. While the links work fine in the local preview, they do not appear as clickable links on Confluence.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how the links are being processed or rendered when the document is converted for Confluence. The local preview environment may handle relative paths differently than the Confluence environment, leading to the links not being recognized or rendered properly.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/project/types/website/website-resources.ts
   src/core/url.ts
   src/core/http.ts
   src/project/project-shared.ts
   src/core/http-devserver.ts
   ```
