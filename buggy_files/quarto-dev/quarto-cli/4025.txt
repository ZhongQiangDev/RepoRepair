### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the single Bokeh plot is being incorrectly identified as multiple subfigures (1b and 1c), which should not exist. The captions for these subfigures are empty and should not be displayed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the Bokeh plot is being processed and identified within the document rendering pipeline. The rendering engine might be misinterpreting the single Bokeh plot as multiple subfigures due to incorrect metadata or configuration settings. This could be related to how the figure captions and subfigure labels are being generated and applied.

### Explanation:

1. **`src/command/render/render-shared.ts`**: This file contains the main entry point for rendering Quarto documents. It initializes rendering services and generates rendering contexts, which could be where the figure processing logic is initialized.

2. **`src/command/render/render-files.ts`**: This file manages the rendering of multiple files and processes each file through a series of steps. It could contain the logic that processes the Bokeh plot and incorrectly identifies it as multiple subfigures.

3. **`src/core/handlers/base.ts`**: This file contains functions for processing language cells and managing figure generation. The `cell` function might be responsible for handling the Bokeh plot and could be where the issue arises.

4. **`src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/web-worker-manager.ts`**: This file manages web workers for processing YAML intelligence. If the figure processing involves YAML metadata, this file could be relevant for ensuring the metadata is correctly interpreted.

5. **`src/core/lib/yaml-schema/project-config.ts`**: This file handles schema definitions and loading. If the project configuration includes settings related to figure processing, this file could be relevant for ensuring the configuration is correctly applied.
