1. **Wrong Behavior**: The title slide alignment is incorrect when using `hash-type: number`. The title, subtitle, author, and date are not centered as expected, unlike when using `hash-type: title`.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue likely stems from how the `hash-type: number` setting affects the CSS or layout logic applied to the title slide. This could involve differences in how the hash type influences the styling or positioning of elements on the slide. The alignment issue suggests that the CSS rules or layout configurations for the title slide are not being applied correctly when `hash-type: number` is used.
