### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when using percentage values for `width` and `height` in the reveal.js format configuration, the presentation does not appear at all, resulting in a blank screen. However, using pixel values works as expected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how reveal.js processes and applies the `width` and `height` values when they are specified as percentages. The template or rendering process may not be correctly interpreting or applying percentage values, leading to a layout that fails to render properly. This could be due to a lack of proper quoting or handling of percentage values in the template or CSS.

**Explanation:**

1. **`src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts`**: This file is crucial as it contains the `revealjsFormat` function, which sets up the Reveal.js format configuration. It likely handles the `width` and `height` properties and ensures they are correctly applied to the presentation.

2. **`src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/highlight/plugin.js`**: This file contains the initialization logic for the Reveal.js plugin, which might be involved in processing the presentation's layout and styling. It could be relevant if the issue is related to how styles are applied during rendering.

3. **`src/core/css.ts`**: This file contains utilities for processing CSS, including functions for handling units and sizes. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how percentage values are converted or applied in the CSS.

4. **`src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/support/support.js`**: This file includes functions like `fixupForPrint` and `applyGlobalStyles`, which might be involved in adjusting the presentation's layout and ensuring proper rendering.

5. **`src/core/lib/yaml-validation/types.ts`**: This file contains utilities for validating and processing YAML configurations. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how the `width` and `height` values are validated or interpreted from the YAML configuration.
