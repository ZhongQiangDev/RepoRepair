The GitHub problem description indicates that code annotations in C/C++ and VHDL are not being handled correctly by the Quarto tool. Specifically, the annotations are detected but not replaced with circle numbering as expected.

### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior is that the code annotations in C/C++ and VHDL are detected but not replaced with circle numbering. This means that while the tool recognizes the annotations, it fails to format them as intended, unlike how it handles R and Python code annotations.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely lies in how the Quarto tool processes different programming languages. The tool may have specific handling for R and Python annotations but lacks similar handling for C/C++ and VHDL. This could be due to:
- Missing or incomplete language-specific processing logic for C/C++ and VHDL.
- Incorrect configuration or mapping of annotation styles for these languages.
- A lack of support for the specific annotation syntax used in C/C++ and VHDL.

### 3. Find Related Files
Based on the repository information, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts
src/core/pandoc/pandoc-id.ts
src/core/pandoc/types.ts
src/core/lib/text-types.ts
src/core/lib/regexp.js
```

- `src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts`: This file likely contains the core logic for generating Pandoc nodes, which could include handling annotations.
- `src/core/pandoc/pandoc-id.ts`: This file might handle the generation of IDs for elements, which could be relevant for annotation processing.
- `src/core/pandoc/types.ts`: This file defines various format configurations, which might include language-specific settings for annotations.
- `src/core/lib/text-types.ts`: This file defines types for handling different forms of string data, which could be relevant for processing annotations.
- `src/core/lib/regexp.js`: This file contains regular expression utilities, which might be used for parsing and processing annotations.
