### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves excessive vertical space before definition, theorem, example, and proof environments in the LaTeX output. This results in an uneven and less professional-looking document layout compared to the hand-written LaTeX version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the excessive vertical space is likely due to the `\leavevmode\vadjust pre{\hypertarget{def-def}{}}%` code that is prepended to the definition, theorem, example, and proof environments. This code is responsible for adding vertical space before these environments. The `\leavevmode` command ensures that the following `\vadjust` command is applied, and the `\hypertarget` command creates a hyperlink target for the environment. However, the combination of these commands introduces unwanted vertical space.

src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/types.ts
src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/hover.ts
```

These files are likely related to the issue because:

- `src/command/render/filters.ts`: This file contains functions that process and apply filters to the LaTeX output, which might include the `\leavevmode\vadjust` code.
- `src/command/render/latexmk/latex.ts`: This file handles LaTeX compilation and might be responsible for inserting the problematic code.
- `src/core/pandoc/pandoc.ts`: This file manages Pandoc-related operations, which could be involved in generating the LaTeX code.
- `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/types.ts`: This file defines types for YAML intelligence, which might be used in the configuration of the LaTeX output.
- `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/hover.ts`: This file handles hover functionality, which might be related to the `\hypertarget` command used in the problematic code.
