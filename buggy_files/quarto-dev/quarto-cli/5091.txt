1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that a non-standard URL for an image fails to render correctly when the document is converted to a PDF. The error message indicates that the URL is being improperly handled, leading to a failure in loading the image.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how URLs are processed and validated during the PDF rendering process. The non-standard URL structure may not be correctly interpreted or sanitized, causing the rendering engine to fail when attempting to load the image. This could be due to issues with URL normalization, handling of special characters, or incorrect assumptions about the URL format.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/core/url.ts
src/core/image.ts
src/command/render/render-paths.ts
src/core/http.ts
src/core/data-url.ts
```

- `src/core/url.ts`: This file contains functions for URL manipulation and validation, which are crucial for handling the non-standard URL correctly.
- `src/core/image.ts`: This file likely contains functions for processing and validating image URLs, which could be relevant to the issue.
- `src/command/render/render-paths.ts`: This file may contain functions related to resolving and processing file paths, which could be involved in handling the URL during rendering.
- `src/core/http.ts`: This file includes functions for handling HTTP requests and URL-related operations, which might be relevant for fetching the image from the URL.
- `src/core/data-url.ts`: This file contains functions for converting content into data URLs, which might be used in the rendering process to embed images directly.
