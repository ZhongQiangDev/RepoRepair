1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the `pander` package is incorrectly formatting the list as a nested list with sub-bullets, instead of a flat list as expected. The output should be a simple unordered list with each item on its own line.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how the `pander` package is interpreting the list structure and converting it to Markdown. The `pander` function might be adding extra nesting levels or not handling the list elements correctly when converting them to Markdown. This could be due to a bug in the `pander` package or an issue with how the list is being passed to `pander`.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/core/pandoc/pandoc.ts
   src/core/pandoc/pandoc-formats.ts
   src/core/pandoc/self-contained.ts
   src/core/pandoc/pandoc-partition.ts
   src/core/pandoc/types.ts
   ```

   These files are likely involved in the processing and formatting of Pandoc documents, which includes handling list structures and converting them to Markdown. The `pandoc.ts` file, in particular, is likely where the core functionality for generating Pandoc nodes and handling lists is defined. The other files may contain additional formatting logic or utilities that could be contributing to the issue.
