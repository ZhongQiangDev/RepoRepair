The GitHub problem description indicates that the code annotation feature is not working correctly for PDF outputs in version 1.3.336 of Quarto. Specifically, the `\circled` command is not defined, and the TikZ package is not included, which are necessary for code annotations.

### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior is that code annotations are not being rendered correctly in PDF outputs. The `\circled` command, which is likely used for styling code annotations, is not defined, and the TikZ package, which is required for rendering these annotations, is missing.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of the TikZ package in the LaTeX preamble when generating PDF outputs. The `\circled` command is probably defined within the TikZ package or a related package that is not being included in the PDF generation process. This omission results in the failure to render the code annotations as intended.

### 3. Find Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/command/render/filters.ts
src/command/render/latexmk/latexmk.ts
src/command/render/latexmk/parse-error.ts
src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts
src/core/lib/external/colors.ts
```

- `src/command/render/filters.ts`: This file likely contains the logic for including necessary LaTeX packages and defining commands like `\circled`. Ensuring the TikZ package is included here would address the issue.
- `src/command/render/latexmk/latexmk.ts`: This file is responsible for the LaTeX-to-PDF conversion process. It may need adjustments to ensure the TikZ package is included in the LaTeX preamble.
- `src/command/render/latexmk/parse-error.ts`: This file might handle error parsing related to LaTeX compilation, which could be relevant if errors arise from missing packages.
- `src/core/pandoc/codegen.ts`: This file could be involved in generating the necessary LaTeX code for annotations, ensuring the `\circled` command is properly defined.
- `src/core/lib/external/colors.ts`: This file might contain color-related configurations that could be relevant if the annotations involve specific color settings.
