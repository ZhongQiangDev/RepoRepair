1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the `crossref: false` setting in the YAML front matter is not being respected. The cross-reference filter is still being applied even when explicitly disabled.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how the `crossref` setting is being processed and applied within the codebase. The `crossref: false` setting should disable the cross-reference functionality, but it seems that the filter is still being applied. This could be due to:
   - The `crossref: false` setting not being correctly parsed or recognized.
   - The filter being applied regardless of the `crossref` setting.
   - A bug in the logic that checks the `crossref` setting.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/command/render/crossref.ts
   src/command/render/filters.ts
   src/command/render/render.ts
   src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/yaml-intelligence.ts
   src/core/lib/yaml-validation/yaml-schema.ts
   ```

   - `src/command/render/crossref.ts`: This file contains functions related to cross-reference processing and likely handles the `crossref` setting.
   - `src/command/render/filters.ts`: This file manages filters, including the cross-reference filter, and is crucial for understanding how filters are applied.
   - `src/command/render/render.ts`: This file orchestrates the rendering process and may contain logic that applies filters based on the `crossref` setting.
   - `src/core/lib/yaml-intelligence/yaml-intelligence.ts`: This file handles YAML intelligence and may be involved in parsing the `crossref` setting from the YAML front matter.
   - `src/core/lib/yaml-validation/yaml-schema.ts`: This file is responsible for YAML schema validation and may ensure that the `crossref` setting is correctly recognized.
