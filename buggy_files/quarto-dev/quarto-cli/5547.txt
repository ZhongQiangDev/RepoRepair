1. **Wrong Behavior**: The hyperlink on a standalone image in a Reveal.js slide is not rendered, whereas the same hyperlink works when the image is accompanied by other content on the slide.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue likely stems from how Reveal.js processes standalone images versus images with accompanying content. When an image is the only content on a slide, Reveal.js might be stripping or ignoring the hyperlink due to specific rendering logic or styling rules. This could be related to how Reveal.js handles slide content layout, particularly for images that are the sole element on a slide.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
```
src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/markdown/plugin.js
src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/highlight/highlight.js
src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/search/plugin.js
src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/zoom/zoom.js
src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/notes/plugin.js
```

These files are likely involved in the rendering and processing of content within Reveal.js slides, including how images and links are handled. The `markdown/plugin.js` file is particularly important as it deals with content extraction and normalization, which could affect how standalone images with links are processed. The other files may also contribute to the overall rendering behavior and could be relevant for ensuring consistent link functionality across different slide types.
