1. **Wrong Behavior**: The `aside` content overlaps with the bottom of the figure when a single figure is included on a slide. If the figure has a caption, the caption even goes below the `aside` content. The desired behavior is for the `aside` content to have priority and always take the bottom part of the slide, with the figure stretching to the top of the `aside` block.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue likely stems from the CSS styling and layout handling of the `aside` class and figure elements within the Reveal.js format. The `r-stretch` class, which is used to stretch images, may not be properly accounting for the `aside` content's space. Additionally, the layout logic for handling figures and captions might not be correctly prioritizing the `aside` content.

- `src/format/reveal/format-reveal.ts`: This file contains functions that manage the overall layout and styling of Reveal.js slides, including the application of classes like `r-stretch` and handling of `aside` content.
- `src/format/reveal/format-reveal-theme.ts`: This file is responsible for configuring and compiling the theme for Reveal.js presentations, which includes CSS styling that could affect the layout of figures and `aside` content.
- `src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/math/math.js`: Although primarily for math rendering, it might interact with the layout if math content is included in captions or `aside` content.
- `src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/notes/plugin.js`: This file manages speaker notes, which could potentially interfere with the layout if notes are displayed alongside figures.
- `src/resources/formats/revealjs/reveal/plugin/search/plugin.js`: This file handles search functionality, which might not directly relate to the issue but could be involved if search results are displayed in a way that affects slide layout.
