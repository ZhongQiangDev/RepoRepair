1. **Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description:**
   The issue is that subfigures are not being labeled correctly when cross-referencing is not explicitly specified. Instead of being labeled as subfigures (e.g., (a) and (b)), they are labeled as regular figures (e.g., Figure 1 and Figure 2). This results in incorrect numbering and captioning for the subfigures.

2. **Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior:**
   The problem arises because the LaTeX code generated by Quarto does not properly handle subfigure labeling when cross-referencing information is not provided. Without the cross-reference information, the LaTeX code treats each subfigure as a separate figure, leading to incorrect numbering and captioning.

3. **Files Most Related to the Cause:**
   ```
   src/command/render/crossref.ts
   src/command/render/filters.ts
   src/command/render/latexmk/latexmk.ts
   src/quarto-core/pandoc/pandoc-id.ts
   src/quarto-core/encode-metadata.ts
   ```

   - `src/command/render/crossref.ts`: This file is crucial for handling cross-referencing in Quarto documents. It likely contains the logic for generating and processing cross-references, which is essential for correctly labeling subfigures.
   - `src/command/render/filters.ts`: This file manages various filters applied during the rendering process. It may include filters that affect how subfigures are processed and labeled.
   - `src/command/render/latexmk/latexmk.ts`: This file handles LaTeX compilation using `latexmk`. It may contain settings or configurations that influence how subfigures are rendered in the final PDF.
   - `src/quarto-core/pandoc/pandoc-id.ts`: This file deals with Pandoc ID generation, which is relevant for ensuring unique identifiers for figures and subfigures, impacting cross-referencing.
   - `src/quarto-core/encode-metadata.ts`: This file encodes metadata into Quarto documents. Proper metadata handling is necessary for accurate cross-referencing and subfigure labeling.
