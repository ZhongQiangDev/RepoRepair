1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the 'Transfer size' column in the 'Large JavaScript libraries' view does not display decimal places for round sizes. For example, `18 KiB` is shown instead of `18.0 KiB`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to the formatting logic used when displaying the 'Transfer size' values. The current implementation probably rounds or truncates the decimal places for values that are whole numbers, instead of consistently displaying one decimal place.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/i18n.js

lighthouse-core/report/report-generator.js
lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js
lighthouse-core/scoring.js
```

- `lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/i18n.js`: This file contains the `formatBytesToKiB` function, which is responsible for formatting byte sizes into KiB with a specified precision. Adjusting the `granularity` parameter here could ensure that decimal places are always displayed.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js`: This file includes logic for calculating and displaying byte weights, which may be involved in the formatting of transfer sizes.
- `lighthouse-core/report/report-generator.js`: This file generates reports and may contain logic for formatting and displaying data in the report, including transfer sizes.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js`: This file contains the `clampTo2Decimals` function, which could be relevant for ensuring consistent decimal formatting across the application.
- `lighthouse-core/scoring.js`: This file includes utility functions for numerical precision, which might be indirectly related to the formatting of numerical values in the report.
