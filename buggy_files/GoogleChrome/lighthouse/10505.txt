### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that Lighthouse reports an error (`NO_TTI_CPU_IDLE_PERIOD`) for the "Time to Interactive" and "Total Blocking Time" metrics when the page has a slow First Contentful Paint (FCP) but is idle immediately after it. This results in no performance score being reported.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how Lighthouse determines the "Time to Interactive" (TTI) metric. Specifically, it appears that Lighthouse is expecting a CPU idle period after the FCP, but when the FCP is slow and the page becomes idle immediately after, Lighthouse fails to identify a valid quiet period for TTI. This could be due to the way Lighthouse is processing the trace data or how it is identifying CPU idle periods.

```

**Explanation:**

- `lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/interactive.js`: This file contains the logic for calculating the "Time to Interactive" metric. It is likely where the issue with identifying the CPU idle period is occurring.
- `lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/interactive.js`: This file also deals with the computation of the "Time to Interactive" metric, providing additional context and potentially related logic.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/tracehouse/main-thread-tasks.js`: This file processes main thread tasks from trace data, which is crucial for determining CPU idle periods. Issues in this file could affect the identification of quiet periods.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/tracehouse/trace-processor.js`: This file processes and analyzes trace data, which is the raw data used to calculate performance metrics. Any issues in trace processing could propagate to metric calculations.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-cpu-idle.js`: This file calculates the "First CPU Idle" metric, which is related to the CPU idle period and could be influencing the TTI calculation.
