### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the DOM size audit is displaying values with unnecessary decimal places (e.g., `2,008.0` instead of `2,008`). This unnecessary precision can be misleading and does not add value since the values are always integers.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the use of the `clampTo2Decimals` function or similar logic that rounds numbers to two decimal places. This function is applied to values that should remain as integers, resulting in the display of unnecessary decimal places.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause are:

```
core/audits/dobetterweb/dom-size.js
core/scoring.js
report/renderer/components.js
core/lib/statistics.js
core/audits/audit.js
```

- `core/audits/dobetterweb/dom-size.js`: This file contains the `DOMSize` class, which is responsible for the DOM size audit. It likely applies the `clampTo2Decimals` function or similar logic to the DOM size values.
- `core/scoring.js`: This file contains the `clampTo2Decimals` function, which is used to round numbers to two decimal places. It may be called by the `DOMSize` class.
- `report/renderer/components.js`: This file contains functions for creating components used in the Lighthouse audit reports. It may be responsible for formatting and displaying the audit results, including the DOM size values.
- `core/lib/statistics.js`: This file contains utility functions for statistical calculations, including `getLogNormalScore`, which may be used in scoring audits. It could be indirectly involved if it affects the scoring logic that leads to the display of decimal places.
- `core/audits/audit.js`: This file contains the base `Audit` class, which other audit classes extend. It may contain common logic or methods that influence how audit results are processed and displayed.
