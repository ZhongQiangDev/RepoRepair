1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that Google PageSpeed Insights is reporting a significantly higher potential savings for unused CSS (70KB) than the actual size of the CSS configuration fetched by the tool (around 20KB gzipped). This discrepancy suggests that the tool is not accurately calculating the size of the CSS resources or the potential savings.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause appears to be related to how the tool calculates the size of the CSS resources and estimates the potential savings. Specifically, it seems that the tool is not correctly accounting for the actual size of the gzipped CSS data fetched by the 3rd party JavaScript tool. Instead, it might be using an incorrect or pessimistic compression ratio, leading to an overestimation of the potential savings.

- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unused-css-rules.js`: This file contains the logic for identifying and calculating unused CSS rules, which is directly related to the reported potential savings.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/css-usage.js`: This file gathers data about CSS usage on the page, which is crucial for determining which CSS rules are actually used and which are not.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/byte-efficiency-audit.js`: This file provides the foundational framework for byte efficiency audits, including methods for estimating resource transfer sizes and computing waste.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/minification-estimator.js`: This file contains utility functions for computing token lengths in CSS and JavaScript, which could be relevant for accurately estimating the size of CSS content.
- `lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/interactive.js`: While not directly related to CSS, this file computes the Time To Interactive (TTI) metric, which could be indirectly affected by the performance of CSS loading and parsing.
