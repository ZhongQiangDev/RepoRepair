### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem description indicates that the i18n text is not being translated during a fatal CLI run. The error message displayed is in English, even though the user might expect it to be in their preferred language.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the i18n (internationalization) system not being properly initialized or utilized when the fatal error occurs. This could be due to:
- The i18n system not being set up correctly in the CLI environment.
- The error handling mechanism not using the i18n system to translate error messages.
- The i18n system failing to load the appropriate locale or translation files.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js
lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js
lighthouse-cli/run.js
lighthouse-core/lib/proto-preprocessor.js
lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/metric.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/i18n.js`: This file contains the core i18n functionality, including message formatting and locale handling. It is crucial for ensuring that messages are translated correctly.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/i18n/swap-locale.js`: This file handles the localization of Lighthouse Result objects, which might be relevant if the error message is part of the result object.
- `lighthouse-cli/run.js`: This file contains the core logic for running Lighthouse audits. If the i18n system is not properly initialized here, it could lead to untranslated error messages.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/proto-preprocessor.js`: This file includes functions for normalizing Lighthouse results, which might be relevant if the error message is part of the result normalization process.
- `lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/metric.js`: This file is part of the metric computation system, which might be involved if the error occurs during metric calculation and the error message is not translated.
