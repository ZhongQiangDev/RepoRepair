### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `rel="noopener"` attribute, when added to `mailto:` links with `target="_blank"`, causes the links to break on Chrome for Android and iOS Safari. Specifically, the support link fails to launch the email client, while the sales link works fine without the `rel="noopener"` attribute.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to how the `rel="noopener"` attribute interacts with `mailto:` links in certain browsers. The `rel="noopener"` attribute is intended to prevent the new window from accessing the `window.opener` property of the original window, which can help mitigate certain security risks. However, it seems that some browsers, particularly Chrome for Android and iOS Safari, do not handle this attribute correctly when used with `mailto:` links, leading to the links not functioning as expected.
