### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves Lighthouse being unable to automatically check the `font-display` value for several web fonts. This results in warnings being displayed for each font URL, indicating that the CSSUsage artifact does not have any stylesheets referencing these fonts.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how Lighthouse is processing the CSS and identifying the `@font-face` rules. Specifically, the problem may be related to:
- The CSSUsage artifact not capturing the relevant stylesheets that reference the fonts.
- The `findFontDisplayDeclarations` method in the `FontDisplay` audit not correctly identifying the `@font-face` rules and their `font-display` properties.
- The way iframes are handled, as the issue is specifically noted for iframes.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

```
lighthouse-core/audits/font-display.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/link-elements.js
lighthouse-core/lib/css-utils.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/iframe-elements.js
lighthouse-core/config/settings.js
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`lighthouse-core/audits/font-display.js`**: This file contains the `FontDisplay` audit class, which is directly responsible for checking the `font-display` property. The issue likely lies within the `findFontDisplayDeclarations` method or the `audit` method.

2. **`lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/link-elements.js`**: This file gathers `<link>` elements from the DOM and HTTP headers, which are crucial for identifying stylesheets. If the relevant stylesheets are not being captured, this could be a contributing factor.

3. **`lighthouse-core/lib/css-utils.js`**: This file contains utility functions for parsing and analyzing CSS. If there are issues with how CSS is being parsed or processed, it could affect the ability to find `@font-face` rules.

4. **`lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/iframe-elements.js`**: Since the issue is specifically noted for iframes, this file, which gathers iframe elements, may need to be examined to ensure that stylesheets within iframes are properly captured.

5. **`lighthouse-core/config/settings.js`**: This file contains settings and configurations that could affect how Lighthouse processes iframes and stylesheets. If there are settings related to iframe handling or CSS processing, they may need to be adjusted.
