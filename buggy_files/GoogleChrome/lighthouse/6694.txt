### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse is suggesting the use of `dns-prefetch` or `preconnect` for origins (`https://www.google-analytics.com` and `https://fonts.googleapis.com`) even though the user has already implemented `preconnect` for these origins in the HTML.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior could be that Lighthouse's audit logic for `preconnect` is not correctly identifying the `preconnect` tags already present in the HTML. This might be due to a few reasons:
- The audit might not be properly parsing the HTML to detect `preconnect` tags.
- There could be a timing issue where the audit runs before the `preconnect` tags are fully loaded or recognized.
- The audit logic might have a bug or limitation that prevents it from recognizing `preconnect` tags for certain origins.

```
lighthouse-core/audits/uses-rel-preconnect.js
lighthouse-core/runner.js
lighthouse-core/computed/network-records.js
lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js
lighthouse-core/config/config.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `lighthouse-core/audits/uses-rel-preconnect.js`: This file contains the audit logic for checking the use of `preconnect`. It is the most relevant file as it directly handles the detection of `preconnect` tags and their effectiveness.
- `lighthouse-core/runner.js`: This file orchestrates the entire Lighthouse audit process. It might be relevant if there is a timing issue or if the audit is not running in the correct context.
- `lighthouse-core/computed/network-records.js`: This file processes network records, which could be relevant if the audit is not correctly identifying network requests related to the `preconnect` origins.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js`: This file handles the preparation and saving of Lighthouse artifacts, which might be relevant if there is an issue with how the HTML content is being processed or saved.
- `lighthouse-core/config/config.js`: This file manages Lighthouse configurations, which could be relevant if there is a configuration issue affecting the audit's ability to recognize `preconnect` tags.
