1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse is unable to measure the First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric when the tab is in the background. The error message "NO_FCP" indicates that Lighthouse cannot record the trace for the page load, resulting in no performance metrics being calculated.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the fact that when a tab is in the background, the browser may throttle or pause certain activities, including the recording of performance metrics. This can prevent Lighthouse from capturing the necessary trace data required to calculate FCP and other performance metrics. The browser's behavior in background tabs can interfere with the accurate measurement of performance metrics.

   ```

   - `lighthouse-core/runner.js`: This file is central to the Lighthouse execution flow and manages the lifecycle of the audit, including trace collection. It likely contains logic related to handling background tabs and ensuring trace recording is accurate.
   - `lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js`: This file handles network and CPU throttling, which can be affected by the browser's behavior in background tabs. It may need adjustments to ensure proper emulation in background scenarios.
   - `lighthouse-core/lib/trace-house/trace-processor.js`: This file processes trace data, which is crucial for calculating performance metrics. It may need to handle cases where trace data is incomplete due to background tab behavior.
   - `lighthouse-core/lib/trace-house/cpu-node.js`: This file deals with CPU-related trace events, which can be impacted by background tab throttling. Adjustments here might help in capturing CPU-related metrics more accurately.
   - `lighthouse-core/lib/trace-house/network-node.js`: This file handles network-related trace events. Network activity can be affected in background tabs, so this file might need modifications to ensure network metrics are captured correctly.
