1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that warnings within the "Passed Audits" section are not visible or are not being displayed as intended. The goal is to ensure that these warnings are clearly visible and presented in a structured manner following the "Passed Audits" section.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely lies in the rendering logic of the Lighthouse report. Specifically, the code responsible for rendering the "Passed Audits" section and its associated warnings may not be correctly structured or styled to display the warnings as intended. This could involve missing or incorrect HTML/CSS elements, or a lack of proper handling for warnings in the audit results.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

- `report-renderer.js`: This file is responsible for rendering the entire Lighthouse report, including the "Passed Audits" section. It is likely where the logic for displaying warnings needs to be adjusted.
- `category-renderer.js`: This file handles the rendering of audit categories, including "Passed Audits". It may need modifications to properly display warnings.
- `details-renderer.js`: This file is responsible for rendering detailed audit information, which could include warnings. Adjustments here might be necessary to ensure warnings are displayed correctly.
- `util.js`: This utility file contains methods for formatting and preparing report data. It might have functions that affect how warnings are processed and displayed.
- `axe-audit.js`: While this file is specific to accessibility audits, it may contain relevant logic for handling audit results and warnings that could be applicable to the issue.
