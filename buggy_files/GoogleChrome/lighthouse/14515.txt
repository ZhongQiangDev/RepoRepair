1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the report meta block does not include the emulated screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor alongside the CPU/Memory power information in the tooltip.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the current implementation of the `ReportRenderer` class, which is responsible for rendering the report's metadata. The `renderMetaBlock` method within this class may not be including the necessary screen dimensions and deviceScaleFactor information in the tooltip.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
report/renderer/report-renderer.js
core/gather/gatherers/viewport-dimensions.js
core/lib/emulation.js
report/renderer/report-ui-features.js
types/lhr/settings.d.ts
```

- `report/renderer/report-renderer.js`: This file contains the `ReportRenderer` class, which is responsible for rendering the report, including the metadata block. It is the most critical file to modify to include the missing information.
- `core/gather/gatherers/viewport-dimensions.js`: This file contains the `getViewportDimensions` function and the `ViewportDimensions` class, which gather the viewport dimensions. These dimensions need to be included in the report metadata.
- `core/lib/emulation.js`: This file contains functions related to device emulation, including `deviceScaleFactor`, which is relevant for the missing information.
- `report/renderer/report-ui-features.js`: This file manages UI features of the report, including the top bar and other interactive elements. It may need adjustments to display the new information correctly.
- `types/lhr/settings.d.ts`: This file defines types for Lighthouse settings, including screen emulation settings. It ensures type safety for the new properties being added.
