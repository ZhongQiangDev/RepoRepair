### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Lighthouse is suggesting the removal of a local (`file://`) resource as a render-blocking resource. Local resources are not supposed to be considered render-blocking because they are not loaded over the network and thus do not block rendering in the same way as network resources.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how Lighthouse identifies and categorizes render-blocking resources. Specifically, it seems that Lighthouse is not correctly distinguishing between network resources and local resources. This could be due to a flaw in the logic that determines whether a resource is render-blocking or how it handles different URL schemes (`file://` vs `http://`, `https://`, etc.).

- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/render-blocking-resources.js`: This file contains the logic for the "Eliminate render-blocking resources" audit. It is likely where the issue originates, as it determines which resources are considered render-blocking.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/network-request.js`: This file manages network requests and could be involved in how Lighthouse handles different URL schemes, including `file://`.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js`: This file provides utilities for handling URLs, including normalizing and processing `file://` URLs. It may need adjustments to ensure local resources are handled correctly.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/dependency-graph/network-node.js`: This file deals with network nodes in the dependency graph, which could influence how resources are categorized as render-blocking.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/tracehouse/main-thread-tasks.js`: This file processes trace events related to main-thread tasks, which could be relevant if the issue involves how tasks are attributed to resources.
