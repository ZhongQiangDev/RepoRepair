1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the report currently uses `<img>` tags to hotlink thumbnails from a remote server, which can cause issues with Content Security Policy (CSP) and mixed content when the report is shown on HTTPS pages. The goal is to replace these thumbnails with full-page screenshots (fpss) to simplify the CSP/mixed content issues.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the current implementation of the report uses `type=thumbnail` items that create `<img>` tags pointing to remote images. This leads to potential security and content policy issues, especially when the report is embedded in HTTPS contexts. The solution involves switching to using full-page screenshots instead of these remote thumbnails.

- `flow-report/src/common.tsx`: This file contains the logic for generating thumbnails and handling image rendering in the report. It needs to be updated to use full-page screenshots instead of remote thumbnails.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/screenshot-thumbnails.js`: This audit is responsible for creating screenshot thumbnails. It may need to be modified or replaced with logic that uses full-page screenshots.
- `report/renderer/report-renderer.js`: This file is responsible for rendering the entire report. It needs to be updated to ensure that it uses the new full-page screenshot assets instead of the old thumbnail images.
- `report/renderer/element-screenshot-renderer.js`: This file handles the rendering of element screenshots within the report. It may need adjustments to work with the new full-page screenshot assets.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/full-page-screenshot.js`: This gatherer captures full-page screenshots. It may need to be utilized more extensively to replace the thumbnail images.
