### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that Lighthouse is erroneously reporting that text compression should be enabled, even though gzip compression is already in use. The user has verified that gzip is enabled using `curl` and the DevTools Network panel.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how Lighthouse is detecting or analyzing the compression status of the responses. Specifically, the audit responsible for checking if responses are compressed might not be correctly identifying the gzip compression headers or content.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most relevant to the issue:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/response-compression.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-ui-features.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js
```

- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-request-compression.js`: This file contains the audit logic for checking if responses are compressed. It is the most directly related to the issue since it determines whether the compression audit passes or fails.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/response-compression.js`: This file gathers data about response compression, which is used by the audit logic. If there's an issue with how compression is detected, it could be here.
- `lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js`: This file generates the final report, including the audit results. If there's an issue with how the audit results are presented, it could be here.
- `lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-ui-features.js`: This file handles the UI features of the report, including how details are displayed. If there's a UI-related issue, it could be here.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js`: This file evaluates the total byte weight of resources, which could be related if there's an issue with how byte weights are calculated and reported.
