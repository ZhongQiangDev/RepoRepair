### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves the duplication of stack packs in the Lighthouse audit results. Specifically, the `Minify JavaScript` audit shows two identical entries for the same JavaScript file, and the `stackPacks` array in the JSON output contains two identical entries for the "React" stack pack.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The duplication of stack packs is caused by the addition of the "Fast Path" checks in the `js-library-detector` library. This change introduced a new way of detecting JavaScript libraries, which resulted in the same library being detected twiceâ€”once via the original detection method and once via the new "Fast Path" method. The issue is further compounded by the lack of unique identifiers (`id`) for the detected libraries, leading to the superloose coupling in the Lighthouse codebase.

- `lighthouse-core/lib/stack-collector.js`: This file is responsible for collecting information about JavaScript libraries used on a web page. It needs to be updated to ensure that each library is detected only once and that unique identifiers are assigned to each detected library.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/stack-packs.js`: This file processes the detected stacks and matches them with stack packs. It should be modified to handle the new detection method and ensure that duplicate entries are not added to the `stackPacks` array.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/dobetterweb/js-libraries.js`: This audit file processes the `Stacks` artifact and generates the audit report. It should be updated to filter out duplicate entries and ensure that only unique stack packs are included in the report.
- `types/html-renderer.d.ts`: This file defines the `StackPackDescription` interface, which should be updated to include a unique identifier for each stack pack.
- `types/lhr.d.ts`: This file defines the `StackPack` interface, which should also be updated to include a unique identifier for each stack pack.
