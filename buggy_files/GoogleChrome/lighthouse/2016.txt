### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The problem described is that when there are 0 passing audits, the report still shows a "View 0 passed items" dropdown. This is unexpected behavior because if there are no passing audits, there should be no dropdown or details to view.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the logic that determines whether to display the "View 0 passed items" dropdown. This logic might not be correctly checking if there are any passing audits before rendering the dropdown. The code responsible for generating the report and rendering the UI elements needs to be examined to ensure it correctly handles the case where there are no passing audits.
