1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the Lighthouse report does not warn users about potential inaccuracies in performance numbers when the report was generated using Headless Chrome. The warning should be prominently displayed at the top of the report to ensure users are aware of this limitation.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of a mechanism in the Lighthouse report generation process that checks if the report was created using Headless Chrome and then adds a corresponding warning message. This could be due to missing logic in the report generation code or a lack of integration with the Headless Chrome detection mechanism.

- `lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js`: This file is responsible for generating the report in JSON and HTML formats. It would need to be modified to include the warning message when the report is generated using Headless Chrome.
- `lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js`: This file handles the rendering of the report into a structured DOM. It would need to be updated to display the warning message at the top of the report.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js`: This file contains functions for controlling network and CPU throttling. It might be relevant for detecting if the report was generated using Headless Chrome.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/console-quieter.js`: This file manages console output and could be relevant for logging or displaying warnings.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/traces/devtools-timeline-model.js`: This file processes and analyzes tracing data. It might be relevant for determining if the report was generated using Headless Chrome based on the trace events.
