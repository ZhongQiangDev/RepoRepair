### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that the audit is reporting a false positive for the manifest's `short_name` length when the `short_name` is missing. Specifically, the audit is indicating that the `short_name` exceeds the suggested maximum length of 12 characters, even though the `short_name` is not present in the manifest.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the audit handles the absence of the `short_name` property. When the `short_name` is missing, the audit should not report a length violation. Instead, it appears to be incorrectly evaluating the length of a non-existent property, leading to a false positive.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to this issue are those that define the audit logic for checking the `short_name` property in the manifest. Here are the most relevant files, ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/manifest.js
lighthouse-core/lib/manifest-parser.js
lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name.js
lighthouse-core/runner.js
```

- `lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name-length.js`: This file contains the audit logic that checks the length of the `short_name` property. It is the primary file that needs to be modified to handle the case where `short_name` is missing.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/manifest.js`: This file is responsible for retrieving and parsing the manifest. It ensures that the manifest data is correctly passed to the audit functions.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/manifest-parser.js`: This file contains utility functions for parsing the manifest. It may be relevant if the issue is related to how the manifest is being parsed or if there are any default values being set for missing properties.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/manifest-short-name.js`: This file checks for the presence of the `short_name` property. It may need to be reviewed to ensure that it correctly handles the absence of the `short_name`.
- `lighthouse-core/runner.js`: This file orchestrates the entire audit process. While less directly related, it may need to be checked to ensure that the audit flow is correctly handling missing properties.
