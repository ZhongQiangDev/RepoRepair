1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the current implementation of number formatting in the codebase does not use `toLocaleString` with the `maximumFractionDigits` option. This results in numbers being displayed without proper localization and decimal place handling, which can make the numbers less readable and user-friendly.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the existing code uses custom formatting methods or simple string conversion for numbers instead of leveraging the `toLocaleString` method with appropriate options. This leads to a lack of consistent formatting for numbers across different parts of the application, such as metric values, element counts, diagnostics, and file sizes.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
lighthouse-core/report/handlebar-helpers.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js
lighthouse-core/audits/content-width.js
lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js
```

**Explanation:**
- `lighthouse-core/report/handlebar-helpers.js`: This file contains helper functions for formatting numbers, including `localeAwareNumberFormatter`, which is directly related to the issue. It needs to be updated to use `toLocaleString` with `maximumFractionDigits`.
- `lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js`: This file includes the `formatNumber` function, which is used for formatting numbers in the report renderer. It should be updated to use `toLocaleString`.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/total-byte-weight.js`: This file contains audit logic that outputs byte weights, which should be formatted using `toLocaleString` for better readability.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/content-width.js`: This file includes audit logic that outputs numerical values (e.g., viewport dimensions), which should also be formatted using `toLocaleString`.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/audit.js`: This is the base class for all audits and includes utility functions like `clampTo2Decimals`. While it may not directly output numbers, ensuring that all audits use `toLocaleString` consistently can be enforced here.
