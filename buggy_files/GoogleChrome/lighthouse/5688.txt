1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The current behavior is that Lighthouse does not flag BMP images under the "Serve images in next-gen formats" audit. The expected behavior is for Lighthouse to identify BMP images and recommend serving them in more efficient formats like JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, or WebP.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from the audit logic not recognizing BMP images as a format that should be flagged for optimization. This could be due to the audit's criteria for identifying image formats needing optimization not including BMP.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```

   ```

   - `uses-webp-images.js`: This file is directly related to identifying and recommending the use of WebP images, which is part of the "Serve images in next-gen formats" audit. It may need to be updated to include BMP images in its checks.
   - `efficient-animated-content.js`: This file handles identifying and optimizing animated content, which might include BMP images if they are used in animations.
   - `offscreen-images.js`: This file deals with offscreen images and their optimization, which could include BMP images if they are loaded but not visible.
   - `uses-optimized-images.js`: This file checks for image optimization opportunities, which should include BMP images.
   - `uses-responsive-images.js`: This file evaluates image responsiveness, which could also involve BMP images if they are not being served in a responsive manner.
