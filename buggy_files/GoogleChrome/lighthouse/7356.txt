### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves an increase in the error rate on the LR backend, specifically related to a 60-second timeout on PSI/LR. The error rate has risen, and the latency has also increased. The `lh:runner:auditing` timing remains stable, but `loadPage-defaultPass` has seen a significant jump, indicating that the issue is likely related to the page loading process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to the `waitForFCP` change introduced in the pull request #6944. This change seems to have introduced a new condition where the system waits for the First Contentful Paint (FCP) event, which may be taking longer than expected. This delay is causing more sites to hit the 35-second `maxWaitForLoad` timeout, which in turn leads to more sites hitting the 60-second render timeout.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause, ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/runner.js
lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js
lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js
lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js
```

- `lighthouse-core/runner.js`: This file orchestrates the entire Lighthouse run, including the timing phases. It is crucial for understanding how the `loadPage-defaultPass` timing is being calculated and where the timeout might be occurring.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/driver.js`: This file handles browser automation and includes methods for navigating and waiting for specific events, such as FCP. The `waitForFCP` change likely resides here.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js`: This file contains the audit logic for FCP, which is directly related to the timing issue.
- `lighthouse-core/computed/metrics/first-contentful-paint.js`: This file computes the FCP metric from trace data, which is relevant for understanding how FCP is being measured.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/emulation.js`: This file handles network and CPU throttling, which can affect the timing of page loads and FCP.
