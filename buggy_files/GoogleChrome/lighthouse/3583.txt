### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that iframes and data URIs are being considered as part of the critical request chains (CRCs), even though they are not render-blocking. This leads to incorrect prioritization and analysis of resources that impact page load performance.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the current logic in the Lighthouse auditing framework that categorizes iframes and data URIs as critical requests. This categorization is incorrect because:

- **Iframes**: While iframes may be fetched at a high priority, they do not block the rendering of the main page content. Therefore, they should not be included in the CRC tree.
- **Data URIs**: These are not actual network requests and do not contribute to the critical path. Including them in the CRC tree is unnecessary and can skew performance analysis.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

To address this issue, the following files are most relevant, ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js
lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/audits/redirects.js
lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js
```

#### Explanation:

1. **`lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js`**: This file contains the `CriticalRequestChains` class, which is responsible for analyzing and generating the critical request chains. It likely needs to be modified to exclude iframes and data URIs from the CRC tree.

2. **`lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js`**: This file contains the logic for computing critical request chains from network records. Adjustments here would ensure that iframes and data URIs are not considered critical.

3. **`lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js`**: This file is responsible for rendering the CRC tree visualization. Changes here would ensure that the visualization accurately reflects the updated CRC tree without iframes and data URIs.

4. **`lighthouse-core/audits/redirects.js`**: While not directly related to iframes, this file handles HTTP redirects, which could be indirectly affected by changes in how critical requests are categorized. Ensuring consistency in how redirects are handled is important.

5. **`lighthouse-core/lib/url-shim.js`**: This file contains utility functions for URL manipulation and validation. It might be relevant for handling data URIs and ensuring they are correctly identified and excluded from the CRC tree.
