### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior is that the Lighthouse report indicates the audit was conducted on an "Emulated Moto G4" even though the user is testing on a real Moto Power G device. The expected behavior would be for the report to reflect that the test was conducted on a real device.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely stems from how Lighthouse identifies and reports the device being used for the audit. Despite running the audit on a real device, Lighthouse might be defaulting to an emulated device setting due to how the device is being connected or how the audit is being configured.

### 3. Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause:

```
core/gather/gatherers/web-app-manifest.js
core/gather/gatherers/viewport-dimensions.js
core/lib/emulation.js
core/config/config.js
core/gather/gatherers/network-user-agent.js
```

- `web-app-manifest.js`: This file might be relevant if the manifest is being used to determine device information.
- `viewport-dimensions.js`: This file gathers viewport dimensions, which could be used to infer the device type.
- `emulation.js`: This file handles device emulation settings, which might be incorrectly applied even when a real device is used.
- `config.js`: This file manages the overall configuration, which could include settings related to device identification.
- `network-user-agent.js`: This file gathers the user agent, which could be used to identify the device type.
