### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that the sizes listed under the Critical Request Chain (CRC) in Lighthouse reports are incorrect. Specifically, all resources in the CRC are listed with the same size (38.18KB), which does not match the actual sizes of the resources as shown in the network tab or other tools.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how Lighthouse calculates and reports the sizes of resources within the CRC. The problem could be due to:

- Incorrect size calculation logic in the CRC analysis.
- A bug in the data gathering or processing of network records.
- An issue with how the sizes are being extracted from the network records and passed to the CRC renderer.
- A problem in the rendering of the CRC visualization where the sizes are displayed.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue, ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js

lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/network-requests.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-records.js
```

- `lighthouse-core/audits/critical-request-chains.js`: This file contains the logic for analyzing and auditing critical request chains. It is crucial for understanding how the CRCs are analyzed and how sizes are calculated.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/computed/critical-request-chains.js`: This file is responsible for computing the critical request chains from network records. It likely contains the logic for determining which requests are critical and their sizes.
- `lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/crc-details-renderer.js`: This file handles the rendering of the CRC visualization. If there is an issue with how sizes are displayed, it could be here.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/network-requests.js`: This file gathers network request data, which is used to compute the CRCs. If there is an issue with how network records are gathered, it could affect the CRC sizes.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/network-records.js`: This file contains utilities for working with network records. If there is an issue with how sizes are extracted from network records, it could be here.
