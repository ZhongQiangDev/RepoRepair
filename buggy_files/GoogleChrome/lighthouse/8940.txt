### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior involves Lighthouse reporting a potential saving of 53 KB for the image `/spritesheet2.png`, which is already 54 KB in size. This suggests that Lighthouse believes the image can be further optimized to achieve a smaller file size, but the user has already attempted to optimize it without success.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue could be related to how Lighthouse calculates potential savings. Lighthouse might be suggesting that the image could be resized or recompressed to a smaller size while maintaining visual quality. However, if the image has already been optimized and further compression or resizing would degrade its quality, the reported savings might not be achievable.

### 3. Related Files
The files most related to this issue are those that handle image optimization and analysis within Lighthouse. Here are the top 5 files, ordered by importance:

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-optimized-images.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/dobetterweb/optimized-images.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/image-elements.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js
```

- `uses-optimized-images.js`: This file contains logic for identifying and analyzing images that can be optimized, which is directly related to the reported savings.
- `optimized-images.js`: This gatherer is responsible for identifying images that can be optimized, which might be influencing the reported savings.
- `image-elements.js`: This gatherer collects detailed information about image elements on the page, which is used by other audits to determine optimization potential.
- `uses-responsive-images.js`: This audit checks if images are being used responsively, which could affect the reported savings if the image is not being served in an optimal size for the viewport.
- `offscreen-images.js`: This audit checks for offscreen images that could be deferred, which might also contribute to the reported savings if the image is loaded unnecessarily.
