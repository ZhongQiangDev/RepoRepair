1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The Lighthouse audit is overestimating the potential savings for minifying JavaScript when it encounters a file that contains a copyright notice with carriage returns and whitespace. Specifically, the file `https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-date-picker-0.1.js` is flagged as not being minified, even though the issue is related to the copyright notice format rather than the actual minification status of the JavaScript code.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue arises because Lighthouse's minification audit (`UnminifiedJavaScript`) is using `esprima.tokenize` to analyze the JavaScript file. When `esprima` encounters the copyright notice with carriage returns and whitespace, it may not handle it correctly, leading to an inaccurate assessment of the file's minification status. This results in Lighthouse overestimating the potential savings.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unminified-javascript.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/scripts.js
lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/psi.js
lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js
lighthouse-core/runner.js
```

- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/unminified-javascript.js`: This file contains the `UnminifiedJavaScript` audit class, which is responsible for detecting unminified JavaScript files. It is the primary source of the issue since it calculates the wasted bytes and percentage based on token analysis.
- `lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/scripts.js`: This file gathers JavaScript file contents loaded by a web page. It is relevant because it provides the script content that the `UnminifiedJavaScript` audit analyzes.
- `lighthouse-core/report/html/renderer/psi.js`: This file processes Lighthouse result data for rendering performance reports. It may be involved in how the audit results are displayed and could influence the reported savings.
- `lighthouse-core/lib/asset-saver.js`: This file handles the preparation and saving of Lighthouse artifacts, including screenshots and trace data. It might be indirectly related if the artifact preparation affects the audit results.
- `lighthouse-core/runner.js`: This file contains the `Runner` class, which orchestrates the Lighthouse auditing process. While not directly causing the issue, it manages the overall audit execution and could be relevant for understanding the context of the problem.
