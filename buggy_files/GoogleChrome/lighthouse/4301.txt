### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that Lighthouse hangs indefinitely during the "Loading page & waiting for onload" step when performing a Progressive Web App (PWA) audit on the specified webpage. This indicates that Lighthouse is unable to complete the audit process, likely due to an issue with the page's loading behavior or the audit's execution.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be related to several factors:
- **Page Loading Issues**: The webpage might have a problem with its loading process, such as infinite redirects, long-running scripts, or network issues that prevent the `onload` event from firing.
- **Service Worker Interference**: Since the audit includes Service Worker checks, a malfunctioning service worker could be preventing the page from loading correctly.
- **Lighthouse Configuration**: There might be a misconfiguration in Lighthouse's audit settings or a bug in the Lighthouse code that causes it to hang during this specific audit step.
- **Browser or Extension Issues**: The issue could also be related to the browser version or the Lighthouse extension itself, as the user mentions using Chrome 63.0.3239.132 and Lighthouse extension version 2.8.0.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
lighthouse-core/runner.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/service-worker.js
lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js
lighthouse-core/lib/network-recorder.js
lighthouse-core/audits/webapp-install-banner.js
```

- **`lighthouse-core/runner.js`**: This file orchestrates the entire Lighthouse audit process. If there's an issue with the audit hanging, it's likely related to how the runner manages the audit lifecycle, particularly the "Loading page & waiting for onload" step.
- **`lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/service-worker.js`**: Since the audit includes Service Worker checks, this file is responsible for gathering service worker-related data. If the service worker is malfunctioning, it could cause the audit to hang.
- **`lighthouse-core/gather/gatherers/start-url.js`**: This file verifies the start URL of a Progressive Web App. If there's an issue with the start URL, it could prevent the page from loading correctly.
- **`lighthouse-core/lib/network-recorder.js`**: This file manages network activity during the audit. If there are network-related issues, it could cause the audit to hang.
- **`lighthouse-core/audits/webapp-install-banner.js`**: This file checks if the web app meets the criteria for displaying an install banner. If there's an issue with this audit, it could contribute to the hanging behavior.
