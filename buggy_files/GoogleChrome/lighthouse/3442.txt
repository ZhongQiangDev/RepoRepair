### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The problem described is that the Lighthouse report page is blank when viewed in the browser. The screenshot shows a JavaScript error in the console indicating that there is an issue with the report HTML file. Specifically, the error messages are:

- `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`
- `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'generatedTime' of undefined`

These errors suggest that the report HTML file is not being generated correctly, leading to a blank page.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The errors point to issues with the report generation process. The `SyntaxError` suggests that the JSON data within the report HTML file might be malformed or corrupted. The `TypeError` indicates that the report data is either missing or not properly structured, causing the `generatedTime` property to be undefined when the report is being rendered.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js
lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js
lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js
lighthouse-core/closure/typedefs/viewer-externs.js
lighthouse-viewer/app/src/viewer-ui-features.js
```

### Explanation:

1. **`lighthouse-core/report/v2/report-generator.js`**: This file is responsible for generating both JSON and HTML reports. The issue with malformed JSON or missing data could originate here.

2. **`lighthouse-core/report/v2/renderer/report-renderer.js`**: This file handles the rendering of the report data into a visual DOM representation. The `TypeError` related to `generatedTime` likely occurs during this rendering process.

3. **`lighthouse-viewer/app/src/lighthouse-report-viewer.js`**: This file manages the interface for viewing and managing Lighthouse reports. It initializes the report viewer and handles report data, which could be involved in the issue.

4. **`lighthouse-core/closure/typedefs/viewer-externs.js`**: This file contains the `generateReportHtml` function, which is crucial for converting JSON report data into HTML. If this function is not implemented correctly, it could lead to the blank page issue.

5. **`lighthouse-viewer/app/src/viewer-ui-features.js`**: This file enhances the report viewing features and handles saving reports as gists. While less directly related, it still plays a role in the overall report viewing experience and could be involved in the issue.
