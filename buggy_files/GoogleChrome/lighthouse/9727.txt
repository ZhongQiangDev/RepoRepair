### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Lighthouse performance score for a page containing an iframe (parent report) is higher (71) than the score for the iframe content alone (child report, 39), despite the iframe content being significantly slower. This is misleading because the iframe content is a major part of the page's performance, and its poor performance should be reflected in the parent report's score.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to how Lighthouse aggregates performance metrics when an iframe is present. Lighthouse may not be adequately considering the performance impact of the iframe content when calculating the overall performance score for the parent page. Specifically, the metrics for the iframe content might not be fully integrated into the parent report, leading to an inflated performance score for the parent page.
