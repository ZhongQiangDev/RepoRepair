1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described involves the `OffscreenImages` audit flagging an SVG file with 0 area, which is unexpected behavior. The audit is supposed to identify offscreen images that contribute to wasted resources, but it seems to be incorrectly flagging an SVG file.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely stems from how the `OffscreenImages` audit handles SVG files. SVGs are vector graphics and do not have a fixed pixel size like raster images (e.g., JPEG, PNG). The audit might be incorrectly calculating the area or visibility of the SVG, leading to the flagging of an SVG with 0 area.

- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/offscreen-images.js`: This file contains the `OffscreenImages` class, which is directly responsible for the audit in question. It likely needs to be modified to handle SVG files correctly.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-responsive-images.js`: This file deals with image optimization and responsiveness, which may have related logic for handling different image types, including SVGs.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/accessibility/object-alt.js`: This file handles alternative text for embedded objects, including SVGs. It may provide insights into how SVGs should be treated in audits.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/accessibility/aria-valid-attr.js`: This file checks for valid ARIA attributes, which may be relevant if the SVG has accessibility attributes that need to be considered.
- `lighthouse-core/audits/accessibility/aria-allowed-attr.js`: This file checks for allowed ARIA attributes, which could also be relevant if the SVG has specific accessibility requirements.
