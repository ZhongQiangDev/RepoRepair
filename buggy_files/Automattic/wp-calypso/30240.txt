1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue described is that the input fields in various steps of the signup process have inconsistent widths. The goal is to make all these input fields have the same max-width as the `site-topic` input field.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The inconsistency in input field widths likely stems from different CSS styles being applied to each input field across the various steps. This could be due to:
   - Different CSS classes being applied to each input field.
   - Inline styles or hardcoded widths in the components.
   - Lack of a consistent CSS class or style rule that enforces a uniform max-width.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
   ```
   client/signup/steps/site-title/index.jsx
   client/components/form-text-input/index.jsx
   client/components/button-group/index.jsx
   client/signup/steps/about/index.jsx
   client/signup/steps/site-or-domain/index.jsx
   ```

   - `client/signup/steps/site-title/index.jsx`: This file likely contains the `site-topic` input field, which has the desired max-width. It can serve as a reference for the correct styling.
   - `client/components/form-text-input/index.jsx`: This file defines the `FormTextInput` component, which is likely used for the input fields. Ensuring this component has the correct max-width will standardize the input fields.
   - `client/components/button-group/index.jsx`: This file contains the `ButtonGroup` component, which might be used to group buttons and inputs. Ensuring consistent styling here can help maintain uniformity.
   - `client/signup/steps/about/index.jsx`: This file contains the "About" step, which might have input fields that need to be adjusted.
   - `client/signup/steps/site-or-domain/index.jsx`: This file contains the "Site or Domain" step, which might also have input fields that need to be adjusted.
