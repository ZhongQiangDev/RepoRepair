1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the "Priority support" card has a different layout compared to the other cards. Specifically, the icon is on the right side of the content, while all other cards have the icon on the left side of the content.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to a discrepancy in the styling or layout configuration for the "Priority support" card. This could be due to a specific CSS class or prop being applied differently to this card compared to the others. The issue might be in the component responsible for rendering the card or in the CSS styles applied to it.
