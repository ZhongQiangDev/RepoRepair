1. **Wrong Behavior**: The "Edit" button, when clicked, does not fully enter the edit mode. Instead, it causes the top and side bars to disappear, but the reader content remains displayed, indicating that the application is not transitioning into the expected editing mode.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue likely stems from a problem in the handling of the "Edit" button click event. The button might be triggering a partial UI update instead of a full transition to the edit mode. This could be due to incorrect state management, missing or incorrect navigation logic, or an issue with the component responsible for rendering the edit mode.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:

```
client/blocks/post-edit-button/index.jsx
client/components/reader-main/index.jsx
client/blocks/post-item/index.jsx
client/blocks/reader-excerpt/index.jsx
client/components/tinymce/index.jsx
```

- `client/blocks/post-edit-button/index.jsx`: This file contains the `PostEditButton` component, which is likely responsible for rendering the "Edit" button and handling its click event. It's the most relevant file as it directly interacts with the edit functionality.
- `client/components/reader-main/index.jsx`: This file manages the main layout of the reader page. It might be involved in the transition between reader and edit modes.
- `client/blocks/post-item/index.jsx`: This file handles the rendering of individual posts in the reader. It could be responsible for managing the state when switching to edit mode.
- `client/blocks/reader-excerpt/index.jsx`: This file manages the display of post excerpts in the reader. It might be involved in the UI transition when entering edit mode.
- `client/components/tinymce/index.jsx`: This file contains the TinyMCE editor component, which is likely used in the edit mode. It might be relevant if there's an issue with initializing the editor when transitioning to edit mode.
