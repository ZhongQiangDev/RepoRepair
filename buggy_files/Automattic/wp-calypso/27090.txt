1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the view counts are missing from the blog posts list. The goal is to display the view counts for each post in the list, as shown in the "After" image.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to the data fetching and rendering logic for post statistics. The application needs to fetch the view counts for each post and then display them in the list. The issue might be due to missing or incorrect data fetching logic, or the rendering logic not properly displaying the fetched view counts.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
