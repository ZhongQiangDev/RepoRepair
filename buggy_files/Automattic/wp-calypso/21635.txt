1. **Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description:**
   The wrong behavior is that the prop `showEmailSettings` is being used to control the visibility of a popover that deals with both new post notifications and email notification settings. This is misleading because the prop name suggests it only controls email settings, but it actually affects both types of notifications.

2. **Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the naming of the prop `showEmailSettings`. This prop is being used to control the visibility of a popover that includes both new post notifications and email notification settings. The name `showEmailSettings` is not accurate, as it implies that it only controls email settings, which is not the case. This can lead to confusion for developers and users who expect the prop to only affect email settings.
