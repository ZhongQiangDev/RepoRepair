1. **Wrong Behavior Identified:**
   The wrong behavior is that after a non-admin user connects their site using Jetpack, they are redirected to `/jetpack/connect/plans`, but instead of seeing the plans page, they see the initial site entry screen (the "Connect a self-hosted WordPress" page).

2. **Cause Analysis:**
   The issue likely stems from a misconfiguration or a conditional check that incorrectly determines the user's role or the current step in the Jetpack connection flow. This could be due to:
   - Incorrect role detection for the user.
   - A misconfigured redirect or flow logic that doesn't properly handle non-admin users.
   - A problem with the state management that tracks the user's progress through the Jetpack connection process.
