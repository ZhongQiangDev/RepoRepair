### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the checkout thank you page for the WordPress.com Premium plan incorrectly states that the plan adds "10GB of file storage" and mentions "No ads or limits," which is misleading. The Premium plan does have storage limits, and the storage amount mentioned is not accurate for all users (especially those upgrading from a Personal plan).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the text or description being displayed for the "Video and audio posts" feature on the checkout thank you page. The text is hardcoded or dynamically generated without considering the specific storage limits and plan details for different users. The storage amount mentioned should be updated to reflect the total available storage for the Premium plan, which is 13GB, and the mention of "No ads or limits" should be removed as it is not accurate.
