1. **Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that after trashing a post, the editor immediately prompts the user to restore the post instead of confirming the trash action or providing a success message.

2. **Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the post trash action not being properly handled or the state not being updated correctly after the trash action. The restore dialog appearing immediately suggests that the application might be misinterpreting the post's status or not updating the UI state correctly after the trash action.
