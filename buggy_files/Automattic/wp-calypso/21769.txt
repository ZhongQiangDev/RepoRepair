1. **Wrong Behavior Involved:**
   The wrong behavior is that the contact form fails to load when there is no primary site selected, resulting in a console error: `Cannot read property 'ID' of null`. This indicates that the code is attempting to access the `ID` property of an object that is `null`, likely due to the absence of a primary site.

2. **Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior:**
   The issue arises because the application expects a primary site to be selected when rendering the contact form. When no primary site is available, the code attempts to access properties on a `null` object, leading to the `TypeError`. This suggests that the application does not handle the case where no primary site is selected, causing the contact form to fail to load.
