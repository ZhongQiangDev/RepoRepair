1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that American Express (Amex) credit card numbers are not being formatted correctly during the checkout process. Instead of the expected format `1234 123456 12345`, the numbers are being formatted as `1234 1234 5612 345`, which is incorrect for Amex cards.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to the credit card number formatting logic within the application. The current implementation seems to be applying a generic formatting rule that groups all card numbers into sets of four digits, which is incorrect for Amex cards that should have a different grouping pattern.
