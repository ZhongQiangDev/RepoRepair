1. **Wrong Behavior**: The word "account." appears on its own line, which is not the intended design. The text should be formatted such that "your account." stays on the same line.

2. **Cause**: The issue arises because the text "your account." is being split into two lines due to a lack of proper text formatting or styling that prevents widows. Specifically, the `preventWidows` function is not being applied correctly to the text content within the `HappinessSupport` component.
