1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that an app banner is displayed at the bottom of the mobile app's stats page, which is confusing for users since they are already within the app.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the `AppBanner` component being rendered even when the user is already within the mobile app. The component is not properly checking if the current context is a mobile app before displaying the banner.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
   client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js
   client/state/selectors/is-directly-uninitialized.js
   client/state/selectors/is-notifications-open.js
   client/state/selectors/is-requesting-site-monitor-settings.js
   ```

   - `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx`: This file contains the `AppBanner` component, which is responsible for rendering the app banner. It is the most relevant file as it directly controls the display of the banner.
   - `client/blocks/app-banner/utils.js`: This file likely contains utility functions used by the `AppBanner` component, such as checking if the user is within the app.
   - `client/state/selectors/is-directly-uninitialized.js`: This file contains a selector that checks if a section is uninitialized, which might be relevant for determining if the banner should be displayed.
   - `client/state/selectors/is-notifications-open.js`: This file contains a selector that checks if the notifications panel is open, which might be relevant for determining the current state of the app.
   - `client/state/selectors/is-requesting-site-monitor-settings.js`: This file contains a selector that checks if a request for site monitor settings is in progress, which might be relevant for determining the current state of the app.
