1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the application is displaying multiple error notices stating "Could not retrieve comments for requested post" when it fails to load comments for a post. This results in a cluttered UI with repeated error messages.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause appears to be that the application is not properly handling the error state when it fails to retrieve comments. Instead of displaying a single error message, it repeatedly shows the same error notice, likely due to multiple retry attempts or a lack of proper error handling logic that limits the number of retries and consolidates error messages.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   client/blocks/comments/post-comment-list.jsx
   client/state/comments/actions.js
   client/state/comments/reducer.js
   client/state/data-layer/wpcom/sites/comments/index.js
   client/notices/index.js
   ```

   - `client/blocks/comments/post-comment-list.jsx`: This file is responsible for managing and displaying comments for a post. It likely contains the logic for fetching comments and handling errors, which could be the source of the repeated error messages.
   - `client/state/comments/actions.js`: This file contains action creators for comment-related operations, including fetching comments. It might be responsible for dispatching actions that trigger the error messages.
   - `client/state/comments/reducer.js`: This file manages the state related to comments. It could be responsible for maintaining the error state and ensuring that error messages are displayed correctly.
   - `client/state/data-layer/wpcom/sites/comments/index.js`: This file handles the data layer for comments, including fetching comments from the API. It might be responsible for the actual API calls that are failing and triggering the error messages.
   - `client/notices/index.js`: This file contains functions for managing notices, including error notices. It might be responsible for displaying the error messages and ensuring they are properly handled.
