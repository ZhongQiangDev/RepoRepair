### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the user is encountering an issue where the "Skip for now" button on the "Activate stats" step (Step 6) leads to the JPC flow instead of the intended next step in the Jetpack onboarding process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the "Skip for now" button being incorrectly configured or linked. Instead of navigating to the next step in the Jetpack onboarding wizard, it is redirecting to the JPC (Jetpack Connect) flow. This could be due to:

- Incorrect routing configuration for the "Skip for now" button.
- A misconfigured action handler for the button click event.
- A bug in the navigation logic that redirects users to the JPC flow when they should be progressing within the onboarding wizard.

client/jetpack-connect/controller.js
client/components/wizard/navigation-link.jsx
```

#### Explanation:

1. **`client/jetpack-onboarding/steps/stats.jsx`**: This file likely contains the "Activate stats" step where the "Skip for now" button is defined. It would be the primary file to check for the button's configuration and click handler.

2. **`client/jetpack-onboarding/wizard.jsx`**: This file manages the overall wizard flow. It may contain the logic for navigating between steps and could be responsible for the incorrect redirection.

3. **`client/jetpack-onboarding/controller.js`**: This file likely contains middleware or controller logic for the Jetpack onboarding process. It might define the navigation rules and could be responsible for the incorrect redirection.

4. **`client/jetpack-connect/controller.js`**: This file manages the JPC flow. If the "Skip for now" button is incorrectly linked to this flow, this file might be involved in the redirection logic.

5. **`client/components/wizard/navigation-link.jsx`**: This file contains the `NavigationLink` component, which is used for navigation buttons in the wizard. It might define the base behavior for navigation buttons, including the "Skip for now" button.
