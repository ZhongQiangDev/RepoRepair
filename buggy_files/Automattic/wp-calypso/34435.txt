1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue described is that after completing the signup flow for a blog, users see an account details screen with a notice indicating their account has already been created. This screen then automatically progresses to the next screen (logged-in checklist for free plans or checkout for paid plans).

2. **Cause Analysis**: The problem likely stems from the flow controller not properly handling the transition between the account creation step and the subsequent steps. The flow might be prematurely advancing to the next step without properly hiding or bypassing the account details screen, leading to a flash of the account details screen before moving on.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
