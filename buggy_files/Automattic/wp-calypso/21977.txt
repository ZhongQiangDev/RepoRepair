1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The problem description indicates that a green success banner should be displayed after a successful Stripe Connect account creation. However, the current implementation does not show this banner.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the fact that the success banner is not being triggered or rendered after the Stripe Connect account is successfully created. This could be due to:
   - The success banner component not being included in the relevant flow.
   - The success banner not being triggered by the appropriate action or event after the Stripe Connect account creation.
   - The success banner component not being properly connected to the Redux store or not receiving the necessary props to display the banner.
