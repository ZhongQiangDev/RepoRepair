1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the upgrade nudge is visible on the media page for users with the 'editor' or 'author' roles, even though these roles cannot upgrade a site. The upgrade nudge should only be visible to users with the 'admin' role.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to the logic that determines whether the upgrade nudge should be displayed. This logic may not be correctly checking the user's role before rendering the upgrade nudge. It could be that the role check is missing or not properly implemented.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
client/blocks/plan-storage/bar.jsx
client/components/data/query-site-roles/index.jsx
client/state/selectors/can-current-user.js
client/state/selectors/is-eligible-for-domain-to-paid-plan-upsell.js
client/state/selectors/is-eligible-for-free-to-paid-upsell.js
```

- `client/blocks/plan-storage/bar.jsx`: This file contains the `PlanStorageBar` component, which likely includes the logic for rendering the storage bar and the upgrade nudge. It is the most important file as it directly controls the display of the upgrade nudge.
- `client/components/data/query-site-roles/index.jsx`: This file contains the `QuerySiteRoles` component, which fetches and manages site roles. It is important for determining the user's role and ensuring that the upgrade nudge is only shown to users with the appropriate permissions.
- `client/state/selectors/can-current-user.js`: This file contains the `canCurrentUser` function, which checks if the current user has a specific capability for a given site. It is crucial for determining whether the user has the necessary permissions to upgrade the site.
- `client/state/selectors/is-eligible-for-domain-to-paid-plan-upsell.js`: This file contains the `isEligibleForDomainToPaidPlanUpsell` function, which checks if a user is eligible for an upsell offer. It may be relevant if the upgrade nudge is tied to this eligibility check.
- `client/state/selectors/is-eligible-for-free-to-paid-upsell.js`: This file contains the `isEligibleForFreeToPaidUpsell` function, which checks if a user is eligible for an upgrade from a free to a paid plan. It may also be relevant if the upgrade nudge is tied to this eligibility check.
