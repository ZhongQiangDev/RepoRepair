1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue described is that when a user switches from the signup form to the login form and then back to the signup form, and subsequently reloads the page, the client ID is lost, causing the styling to be lost and the user to be redirected to the standard WordPress.com login page instead of the styled login page.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The problem likely stems from the client ID not being retained when the user navigates between the signup and login forms. This could be due to the client ID not being stored in a persistent manner (like in the URL or local storage) or not being passed correctly between the forms. When the page is reloaded, the client ID is not retained, leading to the loss of styling and redirection to the standard login page.
