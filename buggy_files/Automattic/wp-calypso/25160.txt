1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that when a user selects a featured image from their Google library, the featured image does not appear in the post preview after publishing. Additionally, the user is prompted with a message indicating unsaved changes when trying to close the post.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from a problem in the process of setting the featured image from the Google library. The image might not be properly uploaded or linked to the post, leading to it not appearing in the preview. Additionally, the system might not be recognizing the image as saved, causing the unsaved changes prompt.
