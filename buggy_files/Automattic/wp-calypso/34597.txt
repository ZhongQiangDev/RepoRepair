### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves users encountering a broken flow when attempting to purchase a plan. Specifically, after deleting all items from the cart and proceeding to checkout, users are directed to a broken flow. The checkout page displays a "Recalculating..." message that never resolves, and the "Calculating price" button remains stuck. Additionally, there is an error message in the console indicating that only administrators can make new purchases.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to user permissions and cart state management. The error message "Only administrators can make new purchases" suggests that the user lacks the necessary permissions to proceed with the purchase. This could be due to the user's role not being correctly identified or updated after deleting all items from the cart. The "Recalculating..." and "Calculating price" messages indicate that the application is stuck in a loading state, likely because it is waiting for a response from the server that never comes due to the permission issue.
