1. **Wrong Behavior**: The "From name" field in the email settings is displaying an undecoded HTML entity (`&#039;`) instead of the expected character (`'`).

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue arises because the site title, which contains an HTML entity (`&#039;`), is not being properly decoded before being used in the "From name" field. This suggests that the code responsible for populating the "From name" field is not handling HTML entities correctly.
