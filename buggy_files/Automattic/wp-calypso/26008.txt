### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that embedded Crowdsignal surveys are not being displayed in the Reader full post view. Instead of showing the survey, the post appears empty or lacks the expected interactive survey content.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the application currently only detects and handles Polldaddy polls but does not have a similar mechanism for detecting and rendering Crowdsignal surveys. The existing code for detecting and rendering polls may not recognize the structure or attributes of Crowdsignal surveys, leading to their omission in the rendered content.

client/blocks/reader-full-post/unavailable.jsx
client/reader/embed-helper.jsx
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-polls.js`**: This file contains the logic for detecting Polldaddy polls within post content. A similar rule needs to be added for detecting Crowdsignal surveys.

2. **`client/lib/post-normalizer/rule-content-detect-media.js`**: This file handles the detection of various types of embedded media. It might need to be updated to recognize and handle Crowdsignal surveys as a new type of embedded content.

3. **`client/blocks/reader-full-post/header.jsx`**: This file is responsible for rendering the header section of a full post in the Reader. If the survey is not being detected, it might not be included in the rendered content, and this file could be involved in the rendering logic.

4. **`client/blocks/reader-full-post/unavailable.jsx`**: This file handles cases where a post is unavailable or cannot be displayed. If the survey is not being detected, it might be falling into this category, and this file could be relevant for handling such cases.

5. **`client/reader/embed-helper.jsx`**: This file contains utility functions for handling embedded content. It might need to be updated to include support for Crowdsignal surveys, ensuring they are properly embedded and displayed.
