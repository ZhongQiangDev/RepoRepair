1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**

The wrong behavior is that the "Are You Sure?" dialog appears when navigating away from a new post after setting and then removing a featured image. This dialog should not appear if there are no unsaved changes in the post.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**

The issue likely stems from the post editor's state management. When a featured image is set and then removed, the editor might still consider the post as "dirty" (having unsaved changes), even though the net effect is no change. This could be due to how the editor tracks changes or how the featured image state is managed.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/index.jsx
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/preview-container.jsx
client/post-editor/editor-featured-image/preview.jsx
client/post-editor/editor-ground-control/quick-save-buttons.jsx
client/post-editor/editor-title/index.jsx
```

These files are likely related to the featured image management and post state tracking within the editor, which are central to the described issue.
