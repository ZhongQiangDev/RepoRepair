1. **Wrong Behavior**: The wrong behavior is that the mobile app nudge is missing from the "congratulations" screen after a user completes all tasks in the Checklist. The mock suggests that there should be a nudge to download the mobile app, but it is not currently displayed.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The cause behind this issue is likely due to the absence of the mobile app nudge component in the "congratulations" screen. This could be due to:
   - The component responsible for rendering the mobile app nudge is not included in the "congratulations" screen.
   - The conditions for displaying the mobile app nudge are not being met, such as a missing flag or state variable.
   - The relevant data or props required to render the mobile app nudge are not being passed to the "congratulations" screen.
