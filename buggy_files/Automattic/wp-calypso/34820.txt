1. **Wrong Behavior**: The application is displaying a blank screen when selecting the "Online Store" segment during the signup process. The console errors indicate that the application is unable to fetch the current user data due to a missing active access token, which is required for querying user information.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue stems from the application's inability to authenticate the user properly. The error messages suggest that the user is not logged in or the session has expired, leading to a failure in fetching the necessary user data. This results in a blank screen as the application cannot proceed without the required user information.
