1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that users cannot transfer ownership of a purchased plan to another administrator on their site. The current system only allows the original purchaser to manage the plan, preventing other administrators from controlling or transferring the plan.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the current implementation of plan ownership and management logic, which is hardcoded to recognize only the original purchaser as the owner. This restriction prevents other administrators from having the necessary permissions to transfer the plan. The system may lack the functionality to check for other administrators with the required capabilities or roles to manage the plan.
