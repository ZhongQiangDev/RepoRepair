1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The upcoming charges section is currently displayed within the main billing history table, making it feel tacked on and not well-integrated. The suggestion is to move this section to a separate tab or under "Pending Payments" for better organization and clarity.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The upcoming charges section is likely rendered within the same component as the billing history table, without being separated into its own tab or section. This results in it appearing as an additional part of the main table rather than a distinct section. The issue is likely related to the component structure and how the data is being rendered.

```
client/me/billing-history/main.jsx
client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx
client/me/billing-history/billing-history-table.jsx
client/me/billing-history/transactions-header.jsx
client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js
```

- `client/me/billing-history/main.jsx`: This file contains the main billing history component, which likely includes the logic for rendering the upcoming charges section. It would be the primary file to modify to move the upcoming charges to a separate tab.
- `client/me/billing-history/upcoming-charges-table.jsx`: This file contains the `UpcomingChargesTable` component, which is responsible for rendering the upcoming charges. It would need to be modified or moved to a new tab.
- `client/me/billing-history/billing-history-table.jsx`: This file contains the `BillingHistoryTable` component, which currently includes the upcoming charges section. It may need to be adjusted to remove the upcoming charges from this table.
- `client/me/billing-history/transactions-header.jsx`: This file contains the `TransactionsHeader` component, which might need to be updated to include a new tab for upcoming charges.
- `client/state/selectors/get-upcoming-billing-transactions.js`: This file contains the selector for upcoming billing transactions, which would still be used regardless of where the upcoming charges are displayed. It ensures the data is correctly fetched and available for rendering in the new tab.
