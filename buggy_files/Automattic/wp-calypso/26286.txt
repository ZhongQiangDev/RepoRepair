1. **Wrong Behavior**: The app banner related to stats is being shown on the `/activity` page, which is not the intended behavior. The banner should only appear on the `/stats` page.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue arises because the app banner is being rendered based on the current route being `/stats`, but it is also being shown on the `/activity` page. This suggests that the logic for determining whether to show the banner is not correctly distinguishing between the `/stats` and `/activity` routes.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:

```
client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx
client/my-sites/stats/index.js
client/my-sites/stats/overview.jsx
client/my-sites/stats/site.jsx
client/my-sites/stats/stats-first-view/index.jsx
```

- `client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx`: This file contains the logic for rendering the app banner. It needs to be updated to check the current route and only render the banner if the route is `/stats`.
- `client/my-sites/stats/index.js`: This file configures the routes for the stats section. It may need to ensure that the banner is only associated with the `/stats` route.
- `client/my-sites/stats/overview.jsx`: This file renders the overview page for stats. It might be involved in the banner rendering logic.
- `client/my-sites/stats/site.jsx`: This file handles the rendering of site-specific stats. It could be relevant if the banner is being rendered based on site-specific conditions.
- `client/my-sites/stats/stats-first-view/index.jsx`: This file renders the first view for stats. It might be involved in the initial rendering of the banner.
