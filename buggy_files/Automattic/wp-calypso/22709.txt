### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the success screen for adding a contact form is displayed even if the user hasn't inserted a contact form or connected Jetpack. This screen should only appear after the contact form has been successfully added and Jetpack is connected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the logic that determines when to display the success screen. The current implementation might not properly check whether the contact form has been inserted or if Jetpack is connected before showing the success screen. This could be due to:
- Incorrect state management in the onboarding process.
- Missing or incorrect validation checks for form insertion and Jetpack connection.
- The success screen being triggered prematurely in the onboarding flow.
