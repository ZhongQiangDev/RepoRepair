1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the address loading indicator (the placeholder UI for the shipping address fields) is touching the unit input fields (Weight unit and Dimension unit). There should be spacing between the loading indicator and the unit input fields to improve visual clarity and user experience.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause of this issue is likely related to the CSS styling of the loading indicator and the unit input fields. The loading indicator's width or margin might not be properly defined, causing it to extend too far and touch the unit input fields. Alternatively, the unit input fields might not have sufficient padding or margin to create the necessary spacing.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

   client/components/address-view/index.js
   client/components/spinner/docs/example.jsx
   client/components/tooltip/index.jsx
   client/components/card/docs/example.jsx
   ```

   - `client/extensions/woocommerce/app/settings/shipping/shipping-origin.js`: This file likely contains the main logic and rendering for the shipping origin section, including the address fields and unit input fields. It is the most relevant file as it directly handles the layout and rendering of the shipping origin form.
   - `client/components/address-view/index.js`: This file contains the `AddressView` component, which is responsible for rendering address fields. It may include the loading indicator logic and styling that needs adjustment.
   - `client/components/spinner/docs/example.jsx`: This file contains the `Spinner` component, which might be used as the loading indicator. Adjusting its styling could help create the necessary spacing.
   - `client/components/tooltip/index.jsx`: This file contains the `Tooltip` component, which might be used for additional information or styling that could affect the layout.
   - `client/components/card/docs/example.jsx`: This file contains the `Card` component, which might be used to wrap the shipping origin section and could influence the overall layout and spacing.
