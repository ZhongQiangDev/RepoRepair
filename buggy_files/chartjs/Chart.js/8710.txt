### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves a `RangeError` when rendering a scatter chart. The error message indicates that the `minimumFractionDigits` value is out of range, which suggests an issue with the formatting of numeric values on the chart's axes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error occurs because the `locale` is `undefined` when calling `formatNumber(tickValue, locale, options)`. This results in the `minimumFractionDigits` value being calculated incorrectly, leading to the `RangeError`. The `locale` is expected to be set in the chart options but appears to be missing or not properly initialized.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
```
This file contains the `formatNumber` function, which is directly involved in the error. It handles the formatting of numbers based on the locale and options provided.

```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
```
This file contains the `LinearScale` class, which manages linear scales in charts. The `numeric` function in this class calls `formatNumber`, so it is relevant to the issue.

```
src/core/core.ticks.js
```
This file contains the `numeric` function, which is responsible for formatting numeric tick values. It calls `formatNumber` and is directly involved in the error.

```
src/core/core.config.js
```
This file manages configuration settings for the chart, including locale settings. If the locale is not properly set in the chart options, it could lead to the issue.

```
samples/utils.js
```
This file contains utility functions that might be used to set up the chart options, including the locale. If the locale is not being set correctly here, it could contribute to the problem.
