1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the border thickness for the chart has increased since version 3.5.0, affecting the visual appearance of the chart. The user wants to reduce the border thickness without affecting the legend's border.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The increase in border thickness is likely due to changes in the default `borderWidth` setting or how it is applied to the chart elements. The issue might be related to how the `borderWidth` property is configured or how it is being applied to the chart's border but not the legend's border.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/elements/element.bar.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
docs/scripts/analyzer.js
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
```

**Explanation:**
- `src/elements/element.bar.js`: This file contains the `BarElement` class and related functions that manage the rendering of bars, including border properties. It is likely where the `borderWidth` is applied to the bars.
- `src/core/core.scale.js`: This file contains functions related to scales and their properties, including border handling. It might contain logic that affects the chart's border.
- `src/core/core.defaults.js`: This file manages default configurations for chart properties, including `borderWidth`. Changes in default settings could be the cause of the increased border thickness.
- `docs/scripts/analyzer.js`: This file contains functions related to chart initialization and updates. It might have logic that affects how chart properties, including borders, are set up.
- `src/controllers/controller.bar.js`: This file contains the `BarController` class, which manages bar charts. It might have logic related to border handling that affects the chart's appearance.
