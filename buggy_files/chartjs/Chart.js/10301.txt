### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the mouse is moved outside the legend, the `onLeave` event is not consistently triggered. This results in the chart content sometimes remaining highlighted even when the mouse is outside the chart area.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from the event handling mechanism in the legend plugin. Specifically, the `onLeave` event is not being reliably triggered when the mouse moves outside the legend area. This could be due to several reasons:
- Event listeners might not be properly attached or removed.
- The event handling logic might not correctly detect when the mouse leaves the legend area.
- There could be a race condition or timing issue where the `onLeave` event is not processed in time.
