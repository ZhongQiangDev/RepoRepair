### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that the legend and title are rendered twice in the chart when using Chart.js v3.0.0-beta.7. This issue does not occur with the LINE chart type but affects other chart types like PIE and DOUGHNUT.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely lies in how the legend and title are being processed and rendered in the chart's lifecycle. In Chart.js v3.0.0-beta.7, there might be a bug or unintended behavior in the rendering logic that causes these elements to be drawn more than once. This could be related to how the chart updates its layout, handles animations, or processes plugins.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
src/plugins/plugin.title.js
src/core/core.animations.js
src/core/core.layout.js
src/controllers/controller.pie.js
```

- `src/plugins/plugin.legend.js`: This file manages the legend plugin, which is responsible for rendering the legend. If there is an issue with the legend being rendered twice, this file is likely involved.
- `src/plugins/plugin.title.js`: This file manages the title plugin, which handles the rendering of the chart title. Similar to the legend, if the title is being rendered twice, this file is a key suspect.
- `src/core/core.animations.js`: This file manages animations in Chart.js. If there is a bug in the animation lifecycle that causes elements to be redrawn unnecessarily, it could contribute to the issue.
- `src/core/core.layout.js`: This file handles the layout of chart elements. If there is a problem with how the layout is being recalculated or updated, it could lead to elements being rendered more than once.
- `src/controllers/controller.pie.js`: This file manages the rendering of pie charts. Since the issue occurs specifically with pie charts, this file might have specific rendering logic that interacts with the legend and title plugins in a way that causes the duplication.
