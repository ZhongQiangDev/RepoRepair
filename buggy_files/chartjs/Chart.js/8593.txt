### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that the radar chart is not rotating as expected. The user wants to rotate the radar chart by a specific angle (1.22 * Math.PI), but the chart remains stuck at the default rotation angle (-0.5 * Math.PI).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the radar chart's rendering logic, specifically in how the rotation angle is applied to the chart. The default rotation angle might be hardcoded or not properly updated when a custom rotation angle is specified. The radar chart's rendering logic needs to correctly apply the user-specified rotation angle to the chart's axes and data points.

```
src/controllers/controller.radar.js
src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js
src/core/core.animator.js
src/helpers/helpers.math.js
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `src/controllers/controller.radar.js`: This file contains the `RadarController` class, which manages the radar chart's datasets and rendering. It is likely where the rotation logic is implemented or needs to be modified.
  
- `src/scales/scale.radialLinear.js`: This file contains the `RadialLinearScale` class, which manages the radial scale used by the radar chart. The scale's rotation and angle calculations are crucial for the chart's appearance.

- `src/core/core.animator.js`: This file manages animations for charts. If the rotation involves an animation, this file might need to be updated to ensure the rotation is applied correctly during the animation process.

- `src/helpers/helpers.math.js`: This file contains mathematical utility functions, including angle and coordinate transformations. These functions might be used to calculate the new positions of the chart elements after rotation.

- `src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js`: This file contains canvas-related utility functions, including drawing and transformation functions. If the rotation involves canvas transformations, this file might need to be updated to ensure the chart is drawn correctly after rotation.
