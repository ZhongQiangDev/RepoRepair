### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when hovering over a pie chart with a specific data array containing a value of `385` while the rest are `0`, and using the `hoverOffset` option, the initial circle's border appears, which should not happen.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The issue likely stems from how the pie chart handles the `hoverOffset` when there is a single non-zero value. The `hoverOffset` might be causing the pie slice to expand in a way that reveals the initial circle's border. This could be due to incorrect calculations of the slice's position and size during the hover effect.

### Step 3: Identify Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/controllers/controller.pie.js
src/elements/element.arc.ts
src/core/core.interaction.js
src/core/core.animations.js
src/core/core.controller.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **`src/controllers/controller.pie.js`**: This file contains the `PieController` class, which is responsible for rendering pie charts. It is likely where the issue originates, as it manages the pie chart's data and rendering logic.
2. **`src/elements/element.arc.ts`**: This file contains the `ArcElement` class, which handles the drawing of arc segments in charts. Since pie charts are composed of arcs, any issues with arc rendering could affect the pie chart's appearance.
3. **`src/core/core.interaction.js`**: This file contains functions for handling chart interactions, including hover effects. The `hoverOffset` functionality is likely implemented here, and any issues with how it interacts with the pie chart could be relevant.
4. **`src/core/core.animations.js`**: This file manages animations for chart elements. If the hover effect involves animations, any issues with animation calculations could contribute to the problem.
5. **`src/core/core.controller.js`**: This file contains utility functions for managing chart controllers. While less directly related, it could contain functions that influence the overall behavior of chart interactions and updates.
