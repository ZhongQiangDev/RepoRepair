### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that in a Polar Area chart with a single data point, only the vertical line at the start of the arc is clickable and responsive to mouseover events. The rest of the filled area does not trigger tooltips or clicks, making it difficult for users to interact with the chart effectively.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in how the chart's interactive elements are defined and rendered. When there is only one data point, the arc fills the entire circle, but the interactive area might only be defined along the starting edge of the arc. This could be due to how the arc's hit detection or tooltip triggering is implemented, possibly not accounting for the case where the arc spans the entire circle.

```
src/controllers/controller.polarArea.js
src/elements/element.arc.js
src/core/core.interaction.js
src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js
src/core/core.datasetController.js
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/controllers/controller.polarArea.js`**: This file contains the `PolarAreaController` class, which manages the rendering and interaction of polar area charts. It likely contains the logic for how arcs are drawn and how interactions are handled, making it the most relevant file.

- **`src/elements/element.arc.js`**: This file defines the `ArcElement` class, which is responsible for drawing and managing arcs in charts. The issue might be related to how the arc's interactive area is defined, especially when the arc spans the entire circle.

- **`src/core/core.interaction.js`**: This file contains functions for handling interactions with chart elements, such as determining which elements are under the mouse cursor. The problem might stem from how these functions handle arcs that fill the entire circle.

- **`src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js`**: This file manages tooltips in charts. The issue with tooltips not appearing over the filled area could be related to how tooltips are triggered or positioned in this file.

- **`src/core/core.datasetController.js`**: This file contains utility functions for managing datasets, including updating and rendering elements. While less directly related, it might contain relevant logic for how datasets are processed and rendered, which could indirectly affect the issue.
