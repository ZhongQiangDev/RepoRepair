1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that when the hover radius is set to 0, the bubble disappears on hover instead of maintaining the same size as when not hovered. Additionally, when the hover radius is set to the same value as the radius, the bubble gets bigger instead of maintaining the same size.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how the hover radius is being applied or calculated in the bubble chart's rendering logic. Specifically, the problem could be in how the `hoverRadius` property is being interpreted or applied during the hover event. The `hoverRadius` should be an additional radius added to the base radius, but it seems to be incorrectly affecting the base radius itself.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/controllers/controller.bubble.js
docs/scripts/derived-bubble.js
src/elements/element.point.js
src/core/core.element.js
src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js
```

- `src/controllers/controller.bubble.js`: This file contains the `BubbleController` class, which manages the data and rendering logic specific to bubble charts. It is likely where the hover radius logic is implemented or referenced.
- `docs/scripts/derived-bubble.js`: This file contains a custom class that extends the `BubbleController` and introduces custom drawing behavior. It might have additional logic affecting the hover radius.
- `src/elements/element.point.js`: This file contains the `PointElement` class, which manages the rendering of points, including bubbles. It includes methods for handling interactions like hover events.
- `src/core/core.element.js`: This file contains the `Element` class, which manages properties like position and animations. It might contain base methods that affect how the hover radius is applied.
- `src/plugins/plugin.tooltip.js`: This file contains the `Tooltip` class and related functions, which handle tooltip interactions, including hover events. It might have logic that interacts with the hover radius.
