1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the y-axis labels in the bar chart are overlapping after upgrading from Chart.js version 2.7.3 to 2.9.3. This results in poor readability and incorrect label placement.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The overlapping labels suggest a problem with how the y-axis tick labels are being calculated or rendered. This could be due to changes in the tick generation logic, label formatting, or spacing calculations between versions. The issue might be related to how the scale is determining the number of ticks to display or the spacing between them.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.ticks.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
src/core/core.interaction.js
```

- **`src/scales/scale.linear.js`**: This file contains the `LinearScale` class, which manages linear scales in charts. The `computeTickLimit` and `getPixelForValue` methods are crucial for determining the number of ticks and their positions, which could be causing the overlapping labels.
  
- **`src/core/core.ticks.js`**: This file includes functions for formatting tick values, such as `numeric` and `logarithmic`. If the tick formatting is incorrect, it could lead to overlapping labels.

- **`src/core/core.scale.js`**: This file contains the `Scale` class and related functions that manage scale configurations and rendering. Issues with scale configuration or rendering logic could contribute to the problem.

- **`src/controllers/controller.bar.js`**: This file contains the `BarController` class, which manages bar chart rendering. If there are issues with how the bar chart is being rendered, it could affect the y-axis labels.

- **`src/core/core.interaction.js`**: This file includes functions for handling chart interactions, including label positioning and rendering. While less directly related, it could still play a role in how labels are displayed.
