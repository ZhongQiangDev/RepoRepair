1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that when the xAxis is enabled, it introduces padding on the left and right sides of the chart to accommodate the tick labels. This padding causes the chart to no longer render edge-to-edge, which is the desired behavior when the xAxis is hidden.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause of this behavior is likely related to how the chart calculates the layout and positioning of the tick labels. When the xAxis is enabled, the chart automatically adds padding to ensure that the tick labels are fully visible and do not overlap with the chart area. This padding is applied to the left and right sides of the chart, which results in the chart not rendering edge-to-edge.

- `src/core/core.layouts.js`: This file contains functions for managing the layout of boxes within a chart, including padding and positioning. It is likely where the padding for the tick labels is being calculated and applied.
- `src/scales/scale.linear.js`: This file contains the `LinearScale` class, which manages linear scales in the chart. It includes methods for determining data limits and converting between data values and pixel positions, which are relevant to the positioning of tick labels.
- `src/core/core.scale.js`: This file contains utility functions for managing scales, including creating tick contexts and calculating tick limits. These functions are likely involved in the calculation of tick label positions and the resulting padding.
- `src/core/core.scale.defaults.js`: This file contains default configurations for chart scales, including options for tick labels. It may contain settings that affect the padding applied to the chart when the xAxis is enabled.
- `src/core/core.interaction.js`: This file contains functions for interacting with chart elements, including determining the position of elements within the chart. While not directly related to the padding issue, it may be relevant if the interaction logic is affected by the padding.
