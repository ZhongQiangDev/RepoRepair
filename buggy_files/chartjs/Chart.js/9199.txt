### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that when `rtl: true` is set in the legend configuration, the text goes off-screen and is not rendered at all. This is contrary to the expected behavior where the text should be rendered correctly from right to left, with the box to the right of the text.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely lies in the handling of right-to-left (RTL) text alignment and positioning within the legend. The `_textX` function, which calculates the horizontal position for text alignment, may not be RTL-aware. Additionally, the legend rendering logic might not properly account for RTL text direction, leading to incorrect positioning and rendering.

### Step 3: Identify Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue, ordered by importance:

```
src/plugins/plugin.legend.js
src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
types/helpers/helpers.rtl.d.ts
types/helpers/helpers.canvas.d.ts
```

### Explanation:
1. **`src/plugins/plugin.legend.js`**: This file contains the core logic for managing the legend, including rendering and positioning. It is crucial to check how the legend handles RTL text and adjusts its layout accordingly.
2. **`src/helpers/helpers.rtl.js`**: This file provides utilities for managing RTL layouts, including coordinate adjustments and text alignment. It is essential for ensuring that the legend's text is correctly aligned and positioned in RTL mode.
3. **`src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js`**: This file contains the `renderText` function, which is responsible for rendering text on the canvas. Ensuring that this function is RTL-aware is critical for proper text rendering.
4. **`types/helpers/helpers.rtl.d.ts`**: This file defines the TypeScript interface for RTL adapters, which is necessary for type safety and ensuring that RTL adjustments are correctly implemented.
5. **`types/helpers/helpers.canvas.d.ts`**: This file defines the TypeScript interface for canvas rendering options, which may include properties relevant to RTL text rendering. Ensuring that these options are correctly defined and used is important for consistent rendering.
