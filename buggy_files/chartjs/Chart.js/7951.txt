### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The GitHub problem description indicates that the current implementation of the Bar chart does not support border radius settings. Users want the ability to add border radius to the bars in a bar chart for a more customized and visually appealing appearance.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is that the current implementation of the Bar chart in the charting library does not include any functionality to apply border radius to the bars. This means that the rendering logic for bars does not account for border radius properties, and there are no configuration options available to enable this feature.

### Step 3: Find Related Files
To implement border radius for bars, we need to modify the rendering logic for bars and potentially update the configuration options to include border radius settings. Here are the most relevant files:

```
src/elements/element.bar.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
src/core/core.config.js
samples/samples.js
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **`src/elements/element.bar.js`**: This file contains the `BarElement` class, which is responsible for rendering bars. To add border radius, we need to modify the drawing logic within this class to include border radius calculations and rendering.

2. **`src/core/core.defaults.js`**: This file manages default configurations for the charting library. To enable border radius settings, we need to add default values and options for border radius in the bar chart configuration.

3. **`src/core/core.config.js`**: This file handles configuration management and option resolution. It will need to be updated to recognize and process the new border radius settings for bar charts.

4. **`samples/samples.js`**: This file contains examples and configurations for different chart types. After implementing the border radius feature, we should update this file to include examples demonstrating the new feature.

5. **`src/controllers/controller.bar.js`**: This file contains the `BarController` class, which manages bar chart datasets and rendering. While the primary rendering logic is in `element.bar.js`, this file may need updates to ensure the new border radius settings are properly applied and managed.
