1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that stacked line charts always begin at zero on the y-axis, even when the `beginAtZero` option is set to `false`. This results in the y-axis not taking the stack into account when calculating the minimum y-axis tick, leading to incorrect visualization.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how the y-axis limits are calculated for stacked line charts. When stacking is enabled, the y-axis should consider the cumulative values of the stacked data points to determine the appropriate minimum and maximum ticks. However, the current implementation seems to ignore the stacking and always starts the y-axis at zero, disregarding the `beginAtZero` setting.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
src/core/core.datasetController.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/controllers/controller.line.js
src/scales/scale.linear.js
```

**Explanation:**
- `src/scales/scale.linearbase.js`: This file contains the `LinearScaleBase` class, which manages linear scaling operations, including determining data limits and generating ticks. The `handleTickRangeOptions` method likely needs to be adjusted to properly handle stacked data.
- `src/core/core.datasetController.js`: This file contains functions related to dataset management, including stack processing. The `updateStacks` function might need to be modified to ensure the y-axis limits are correctly calculated for stacked data.
- `src/core/core.scale.js`: This file contains utility functions for scales, including `getPixelForValue` and `getValueForPixel`, which are crucial for converting between data values and pixel positions. Adjustments here might be necessary to ensure proper scaling for stacked data.
- `src/controllers/controller.line.js`: This file contains the `LineController` class, which manages line chart datasets. The `update` method might need to be adjusted to ensure the y-axis limits are correctly set for stacked line charts.
- `src/scales/scale.linear.js`: This file contains the `LinearScale` class, which extends `LinearScaleBase` and handles linear scaling for data visualization. The `determineDataLimits` method might need to be modified to properly handle stacked data.
