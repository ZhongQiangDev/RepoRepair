### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves a `RangeError` being thrown due to an out-of-range value for `minimumFractionDigits` when creating a new `Intl.NumberFormat` instance. This error occurs during the chart initialization process, specifically when the chart library attempts to format numbers for display.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the error is that the `minimumFractionDigits` option is being set to `NaN` or an invalid value, which is out of the acceptable range for the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor. This likely happens because the chart library is not properly validating or defaulting the `minimumFractionDigits` value before passing it to the `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis and the provided repository information, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/helpers/helpers.intl.js
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.controller.js
src/core/core.ticks.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
```

### Explanation:

1. **`src/helpers/helpers.intl.js`**: This file contains the `getNumberFormat` function, which is directly responsible for creating the `Intl.NumberFormat` instance. The error occurs here when `minimumFractionDigits` is `NaN` or invalid.

2. **`src/scales/scale.linear.js`**: This file manages linear scales and includes methods like `determineDataLimits` and `computeTickLimit`, which could be involved in setting up the options for number formatting.

3. **`src/core/core.controller.js`**: This file contains the core `Chart` class, which initializes and manages the chart. It could be responsible for passing the incorrect options to the `Intl.NumberFormat` function.

4. **`src/core/core.ticks.js`**: This file includes functions for formatting tick values, which might be where the `minimumFractionDigits` option is being set or modified.

5. **`src/core/core.defaults.js`**: This file manages default configurations for the chart. It could be where the default values for `minimumFractionDigits` are set, potentially leading to the issue if not properly validated.
