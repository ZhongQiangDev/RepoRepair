1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that when clicking on a multi-line label in the legend, the action (such as hiding or showing the corresponding dataset) is applied to the wrong label. Specifically, it affects the label above the one clicked, and this issue worsens with more labels.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from a miscalculation of the click position relative to the legend labels. When the legend is positioned on the right and labels are multi-line, the click event might be incorrectly mapped to the label above the intended one due to incorrect height or offset calculations. This could be caused by improper handling of multi-line text dimensions or incorrect event target identification.
