### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that the bars in the bar chart do not achieve 100% width as expected. Instead, there are empty spaces or borders between the bars, and the spacing is inconsistent. The goal is to have the bars fill the entire width of the chart without any gaps, similar to a histogram.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the configuration of the bar chart's `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage` properties. These properties control the width of the bars and the spacing between them. If these properties are not set correctly, the bars will not fill the entire width of the chart.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause of this issue are:

```
src/controllers/controller.bar.js
src/core/core.defaults.js
docs/scripts/analyzer.js
src/elements/element.bar.js
src/core/core.scale.defaults.js
```

- `src/controllers/controller.bar.js`: This file contains the `BarController` class, which manages the rendering and data processing of bar charts. It includes methods for calculating bar sizes and positions, which are crucial for ensuring the bars fill the chart width correctly.
- `src/core/core.defaults.js`: This file manages default configurations for chart properties, including `categoryPercentage` and `barPercentage`. Adjusting these defaults can affect the bar spacing and width.
- `docs/scripts/analyzer.js`: This file contains functions that are executed during chart initialization and updates. It may contain logic that affects how the bars are rendered or spaced.
- `src/elements/element.bar.js`: This file contains the `BarElement` class, which handles the drawing and interaction of individual bars. It includes methods for calculating bar dimensions and rendering them on the canvas.
- `src/core/core.scale.defaults.js`: This file sets default configurations for chart scales, which can influence how the bars are positioned and sized within the chart area.
