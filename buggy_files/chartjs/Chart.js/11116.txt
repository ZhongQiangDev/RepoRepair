### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that a tick is sometimes rendered outside the user-defined `max` axis limit when `includeBounds=false` is set on the axis of a line chart. This results in an unsightly appearance, especially when plotting eye diagrams, as shown in the images provided. The left image shows the issue where a tick extends beyond the defined `max` limit, while the right image shows the desired behavior where the tick is correctly constrained within the limits.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the tick generation and positioning logic within the chart library. When `includeBounds=false`, the library should ideally ensure that ticks are generated and positioned strictly within the user-defined `min` and `max` limits. However, there seems to be a flaw in the calculation or logic that determines the tick positions, causing some ticks to extend beyond the `max` limit.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/scales/scale.linearbase.js
src/core/core.ticks.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/plugins/plugin.filler/filler.target.js
```

- `src/scales/scale.linear.js`: This file contains the `LinearScale` class, which handles linear scaling operations, including determining data limits and converting between data values and pixel positions. The issue likely involves incorrect tick generation or positioning logic within this class.

- `src/scales/scale.linearbase.js`: This file contains the `LinearScaleBase` class, which includes methods like `generateTicks` and `buildTicks`. These methods are responsible for generating and positioning ticks on the scale, making them critical for ensuring ticks stay within the defined limits.

- `src/core/core.ticks.js`: This file contains utility functions for calculating and formatting tick values. Functions like `calculateDelta` and `numeric` may be involved in determining the spacing and values of ticks, which could contribute to the issue.

- `src/core/core.scale.js`: This file contains utility functions related to scales, including methods for calculating pixel positions for values and determining tick mark lengths. These functions could be involved in the incorrect positioning of ticks.

- `src/plugins/plugin.filler/filler.target.js`: Although this file is more related to filling areas in charts, it contains functions like `computeBoundary` and `computeLinearBoundary`, which might be indirectly involved in determining the boundaries of the chart area, potentially affecting tick positioning.
