### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the rightmost data point in the line chart is getting cropped off, even though the tooltip for that point is displayed correctly. This indicates an issue with the chart's rendering or layout that causes the last data point to be partially or fully outside the visible area of the chart.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be related to how the chart's dimensions are calculated or how the data points are positioned within the chart area. Specifically, the chart might not be accounting for the space needed for the last data point, causing it to be clipped at the edge of the chart. This could be due to incorrect padding, margin calculations, or an issue with the chart's layout system.

```
src/core/core.layouts.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/controllers/controller.line.js
src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js
types/index.esm.d.ts
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/core/core.layouts.js`**: This file is crucial for managing the layout of chart components. The issue might be related to how the chart area is calculated and how padding or margins are applied, which could cause the last data point to be clipped.

- **`src/core/core.scale.js`**: This file handles the scaling and positioning of data points on the chart. Incorrect calculations in this file could lead to the last data point being positioned outside the visible area.

- **`src/controllers/controller.line.js`**: This file contains the logic for rendering line charts. The issue might be related to how the line chart controller calculates the positions of the data points or how it handles the rendering of the last data point.

- **`src/helpers/helpers.canvas.js`**: This file contains utility functions for canvas operations, including drawing and positioning elements. If there is an issue with how the canvas is being drawn or how elements are being positioned, it could cause the last data point to be clipped.

- **`types/index.esm.d.ts`**: This file contains type definitions for the charting library. While less likely to be the direct cause of the issue, incorrect type definitions could lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the codebase.
