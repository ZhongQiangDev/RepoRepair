### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the first and last horizontal labels on a custom scale are getting cut off. This issue affects the visibility of the labels, which should ideally be fully visible as is the case with the vertical axis labels.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The cause of the label cutoff likely involves how the chart calculates and positions the labels on the custom scale. The issue could stem from:
- Incorrect calculation of label positions relative to the chart area.
- Insufficient space allocated for the labels, causing them to be clipped.
- Misalignment of the labels with the chart's bounding box.

### Step 3: Identify Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/scales/scale.linear.js
src/core/core.scale.js
src/core/core.scale.autoskip.js
src/core/core.layouts.js
docs/scripts/analyzer.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **`src/scales/scale.linear.js`**: This file contains the `LinearScale` class, which manages linear scales in charts. It includes methods for determining data limits, building ticks, and converting between pixel values and data values. Issues with label positioning or clipping could originate here.

2. **`src/core/core.scale.js`**: This file contains utility functions related to scales, including methods for creating scale contexts, calculating tick limits, and managing tick spacing. Problems with label visibility or positioning might be addressed here.

3. **`src/core/core.scale.autoskip.js`**: This file includes functions for managing tick display to prevent label overlap. If the labels are being cut off due to spacing issues, this file might need adjustments.

4. **`src/core/core.layouts.js`**: This file manages the layout of boxes within a chart, including functions for adding, removing, and positioning layout items. If the labels are being clipped due to layout issues, this file could be relevant.

5. **`docs/scripts/analyzer.js`**: This file contains functions related to chart initialization and updates. While less directly related to the core issue, it might influence how the chart is rendered and could be involved in the problem if there are issues with chart initialization or updates.
