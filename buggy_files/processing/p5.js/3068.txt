1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that `loadStrings()` in p5.js filters out empty lines when loading a text file, whereas Processing includes empty strings in the array for each empty line. This discrepancy causes line numbers in shader errors to not match the lines in the source files.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely in the implementation of the `loadStrings()` function within p5.js. It seems to be filtering out empty lines during the process of splitting the text into an array of strings. This filtering behavior is not present in the Processing version of `loadStrings()`, leading to the mismatch in line numbers.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/io/files.js
   lib/addons/p5.dom.js
   src/utilities/string/functions.js
   tasks/build/browserify.js
   tasks/build/combineModules.js
   ```

   - `src/io/files.js`: This file contains the `loadStrings` function, which is directly responsible for loading text files and splitting them into lines. It is the most relevant file as it contains the function that needs to be modified.
   - `lib/addons/p5.dom.js`: This file contains various DOM manipulation functions, which might be indirectly related if the issue involves how text is processed or loaded in the DOM context.
   - `src/utilities/string/functions.js`: This file contains string manipulation functions, which might be used by `loadStrings` for processing the text. Ensuring consistent behavior with string handling could be important.
   - `tasks/build/browserify.js`: This file is part of the build process and might be relevant if the issue is related to how the code is bundled or transformed during the build.
   - `tasks/build/combineModules.js`: Another build-related file that might be relevant if the issue involves module combination or minification affecting the behavior of `loadStrings`.
