1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when using the `MULTIPLY` blend mode with transparent textures in WebGL, the alpha channel is ignored, causing the text to appear as solid rectangles instead of respecting the transparency of the glyphs. This results in incorrect blending where the text appears as solid blocks rather than the expected semi-transparent characters.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the `MULTIPLY` blend mode is implemented in the WebGL renderer. Specifically, the blending operation may not be correctly handling the alpha channel of the texture, leading to the solid color appearance. This could be due to incorrect blending function settings or improper handling of texture alpha values during the rendering process.

- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`: This file contains the core WebGL rendering functions, including the `blendMode` function, which sets the blending mode. It is crucial for understanding how blending is configured in WebGL.
- `src/webgl/text.js`: This file handles text rendering in WebGL, including the `_renderText` function, which is responsible for rendering text with proper alignment and shaders. It may contain the logic for handling text transparency.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`: This file includes methods for rendering custom shapes and handling immediate mode rendering, which could be relevant if text rendering involves custom shape handling.
- `src/core/rendering.js`: This file contains the `blendMode` function that sets the blending mode for the canvas. It may provide insights into how blending is generally handled in p5.js.
- `src/webgl/material.js`: This file manages material properties and blending in WebGL, which could be relevant if the issue involves material settings affecting the blending behavior.
