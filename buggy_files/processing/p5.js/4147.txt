1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue described is that the vertex color interpolation in WEBGL mode is not working as expected in p5.js version 0.9.0. The expected behavior is for the colors to be interpolated smoothly across the vertices of the shape, as seen in version 0.8.0. However, in version 0.9.0, the colors appear to be incorrectly applied, resulting in a different visual output.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The problem likely stems from changes in how vertex colors are handled or interpolated in the WebGL renderer between versions 0.8.0 and 0.9.0. This could involve modifications to the WebGL shader programs, the way vertex data is passed to the shaders, or how the WebGL context is configured for color interpolation.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
src/webgl/p5.Shader.js
src/color/p5.Color.js
src/core/shape/vertex.js
```

- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`: This file contains the `vertex` function and other immediate mode rendering functions that directly interact with the WebGL context. Changes here could affect how vertex colors are passed and interpolated.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`: This file manages the overall WebGL rendering context and includes functions for setting up shaders and handling WebGL state. Issues in shader setup or state management could lead to incorrect color interpolation.
- `src/webgl/p5.Shader.js`: This file defines the shader objects used for rendering. Changes in shader definitions or how shaders handle vertex colors could cause the observed behavior.
- `src/color/p5.Color.js`: This file handles color objects and their properties. If there were changes in how colors are stored or converted, it could affect the vertex color data.
- `src/core/shape/vertex.js`: This file contains the `vertex` function used in the example code. While the immediate mode rendering handles the actual WebGL interaction, this file is responsible for defining the vertices and their properties.
