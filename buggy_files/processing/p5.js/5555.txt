1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that when using WebGL mode in p5.js, the alpha blending of shapes is blending with the background color of the page instead of the background color of the canvas. This results in unexpected color blending, as seen in the second image where the red square blends with the blue background of the page rather than the black background of the canvas.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause of this issue is likely related to the default WebGL context settings, specifically the alpha blending behavior. By default, WebGL allows the canvas to be transparent, meaning it blends with the background of the page. The solution proposed is to set the alpha attribute to `false` when creating the WebGL context, which would prevent this blending and make the canvas background opaque.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/core/rendering.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
src/core/p5.Graphics.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js
```

- `src/core/rendering.js`: This file contains the `createCanvas` function, which initializes the canvas and sets up the renderer. It is crucial for setting the initial WebGL context attributes.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`: This file contains the `p5.RendererGL` constructor and various methods related to WebGL rendering. It includes the `setAttributes` method, which can be used to configure WebGL context attributes like alpha.
- `src/core/p5.Graphics.js`: This file initializes the `p5.Graphics` object, which is responsible for creating and managing off-screen graphics buffers. It ensures that the correct renderer is set up, including WebGL-specific settings.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`: This file contains methods for immediate mode rendering in WebGL, including handling of stroke and fill operations. It may need adjustments if the alpha blending behavior changes.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js`: This file manages retained mode rendering in WebGL, including buffer initialization and geometry rendering. It may also need to be updated to reflect changes in alpha blending behavior.
