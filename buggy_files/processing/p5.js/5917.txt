1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that WebGL sketches do not have an alpha channel by default, which leads to unexpected blending and transparency issues. Specifically, the WebGL context is not set up with `premultipliedAlpha: true`, which is necessary for proper alpha channel handling.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the WebGL context is initialized without the `premultipliedAlpha: true` attribute. This results in incorrect blending of transparent regions and objects, as seen in the provided examples. To fix this, the WebGL context needs to be configured with `premultipliedAlpha: true`, and potentially other related settings like blend functions and shader modifications.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js
src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js
src/webgl/p5.Shader.js
src/webgl/p5.Texture.js
```

- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`: This file initializes the WebGL renderer and sets up the WebGL context. It is crucial for configuring the WebGL context attributes, including `premultipliedAlpha`.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`: This file handles immediate mode rendering in WebGL, which involves setting up shaders and managing blending. It needs to be updated to handle premultiplied alpha correctly.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js`: This file manages retained mode rendering, including buffer initialization and texture handling. It may need adjustments to ensure proper handling of alpha channels.
- `src/webgl/p5.Shader.js`: This file manages shaders, which need to be updated to handle premultiplied alpha correctly in the fragment shader.
- `src/webgl/p5.Texture.js`: This file handles texture initialization and updates, which may need adjustments to ensure textures are properly handled with premultiplied alpha.
