### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the current `fesErrorMonitor` in FES not providing enough error messages for certain types of errors that users might encounter. The goal is to add more error types and corresponding friendly error messages to improve user experience and help users understand and fix issues more easily.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the existing list of errors and their friendly messages in `fesErrorMonitor` is incomplete. This means that when certain errors occur, the system does not have a predefined friendly message to display, leading to a less helpful error notification for the user. The images provided in the GitHub problem description show examples of additional error types and their proposed friendly messages that need to be added.
