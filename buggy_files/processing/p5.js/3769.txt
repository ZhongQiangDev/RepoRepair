1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that when a shader is used to create a geometry, the render buffers are created based on the current shader's attributes. If the shader used for creating the geometry does not have certain attributes, those buffers are not created. Later, when a different shader that requires those attributes is used, the geometry fails to render correctly because the necessary buffers are missing.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the render buffers for geometry are created at the time the geometry is cached, using the attributes of the current shader. If the current shader does not include all the necessary attributes, the buffers for those attributes are not created. When a shader that requires those attributes is later used, it cannot find the buffers and fails to render the geometry correctly.

src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js
```

- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Retained.js`: This file is crucial as it handles the creation and management of render buffers for retained-mode geometry, which is where the issue arises.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.js`: This file contains the core WebGL rendering logic, including shader management and buffer handling, which are central to the problem.
- `src/webgl/p5.Geometry.js`: This file deals with the creation and manipulation of 3D geometries, which are affected by the buffer creation issue.
- `src/webgl/p5.Shader.js`: This file manages shaders, including their attributes and uniforms, which are key to understanding why certain buffers are or are not created.
- `src/webgl/p5.RendererGL.Immediate.js`: This file handles immediate-mode rendering, which may also be relevant if the issue extends to immediate-mode geometry.
