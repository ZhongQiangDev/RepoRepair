### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the following issues:

- **Incorrect Near and Far Values**: When using `ortho()` or `frustum()`, the `cameraNear` and `cameraFar` values in the camera object do not reflect the values passed to these functions. Instead, they show default values.
- **Default Behavior of `frustum()`**: The `frustum()` function behaves more like `perspective()` and defaults to something close to `ortho()`, causing objects to disappear when called without arguments.
- **Vertical Direction Reversal**: The vertical direction is reversed when using `ortho()` and `frustum()`, requiring a sign reversal in the matrix component calculation.
- **Reversed Vertical Rotation Direction**: The vertical rotation direction is reversed when the 3rd and 4th arguments of `ortho()` and `frustum()` are reversed, due to the determinant of the projection matrix being negative.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues seem to stem from how the projection matrices are being set up and applied within the WebGL renderer. Specifically:

- **Incorrect Near and Far Values**: The values passed to `ortho()` and `frustum()` are not being correctly applied to the camera's `cameraNear` and `cameraFar` properties.
- **Default Behavior of `frustum()`**: The default values for `frustum()` are not being set correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Vertical Direction Reversal**: The sign of the y-component in the matrix calculation might be incorrect, causing the vertical direction to be reversed.
- **Reversed Vertical Rotation Direction**: The determinant of the projection matrix might be negative, causing the rotation direction to be reversed.
