1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when the calendar is opened by clicking the calendar icon, it is impossible to select a date using the arrow keys on the keyboard. However, when the calendar is opened by clicking on the input field, keyboard navigation works as expected.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the date picker handles focus and keyboard events when the calendar is opened via the icon versus the input field. The event listeners or focus management might be set up differently depending on the method of opening the calendar, leading to inconsistent keyboard navigation behavior.

- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js`: This file contains the main `DatePicker` component, which integrates with `flatpickr` and manages the date picker's behavior. It likely contains the core logic for handling keyboard events and focus management.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/fixEventsPlugin.js`: This plugin is specifically designed to improve event handling, particularly for keyboard interactions in date input fields. It may contain the logic that needs to be adjusted to ensure consistent keyboard navigation.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePickerInput.js`: This file defines the `DatePickerInput` component, which is responsible for rendering the input field and calendar icon. It might have specific event listeners or focus handling that differ based on how the calendar is opened.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker-story.js`: This file contains stories for the `DatePicker` component, which can be used to test and debug the issue. It might help in identifying the differences in behavior between opening the calendar via the icon and the input field.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.Skeleton.js`: This file defines the skeleton component for the date picker, which might be relevant if the issue is related to the loading state or initial setup of the date picker.
