### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that the `IconButton` component has incorrect right padding. The screenshot shows that the icon button appears to have padding that is inconsistent with the expected design, specifically using padding from the `md` button style instead of the intended padding for an `IconButton`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect padding is likely due to the `IconButton` component inheriting or applying styles from the wrong button size or style variant. This could be due to a few reasons:
- Incorrect CSS class application for the `IconButton`.
- The `IconButton` component is using the wrong size or style variant configuration.
- There might be a bug in the `IconButton` component's styling logic that incorrectly applies padding from the `md` button style.

- `packages/react/src/components/IconButton/IconButton.js`: This file defines the `IconButton` component and is likely where the issue originates. It may be incorrectly applying styles or using the wrong button size variant.
- `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`: This file defines the base `Button` component, which the `IconButton` may be extending or using styles from. The issue could be related to how the `IconButton` interacts with the base `Button` styles.
- `packages/react/src/components/IconButton/index.js`: This file exports the `IconButton` component and may contain additional styling or configuration that affects the padding.
- `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `Button` component, which may help identify if the issue is related to the base button styles.
- `packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js`: This file defines the `Tooltip` component, which is used by the `IconButton`. While less directly related, it could be involved if the tooltip is affecting the button's layout or padding.
