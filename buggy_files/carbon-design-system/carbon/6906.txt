1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The problem description indicates that there are accessibility issues with the `MultiSelect.Filterable` component. Specifically, the DAP tool is reporting violations related to the `id` attribute values not being unique and elements with the `option` role not being contained within a `listbox` role.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - **Non-unique `id` values:** The `id` attribute for the `input` element is being reused, which violates the requirement that `id` values must be unique within a document.
   - **Incorrect ARIA roles:** The elements with the `option` role are not properly contained within an element with the `listbox` role, which is a requirement for proper ARIA compliance.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/FilterableMultiSelect.js
   packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js
   packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect-story.js
   packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/tools/itemToString.js
   packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
   ```

   - `FilterableMultiSelect.js`: This file likely contains the core logic for the `MultiSelect.Filterable` component, where the `id` attributes and ARIA roles are defined.
   - `MultiSelect.js`: This file may contain shared logic or base classes that `FilterableMultiSelect` extends or uses, which could also be contributing to the issue.
   - `MultiSelect-story.js`: This file contains storybook configurations and examples, which might help in understanding how the component is intended to be used and could reveal any misconfigurations.
   - `itemToString.js`: This utility file might be involved in generating the `id` values or managing the items within the multi-select, which could be relevant to the non-unique `id` issue.
   - `ListBox.js`: This file contains the `ListBox` component, which is likely used to render the list of options. Ensuring that the `ListBox` correctly implements the `listbox` role is crucial for ARIA compliance.
