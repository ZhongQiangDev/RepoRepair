1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `legendText` prop of the `FormGroup` component only accepts a `string` value and does not support a `Tooltip` component or any other non-string value. This prevents the user from adding help information as a `Tooltip` for the `legendText`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the `FormGroup` component's prop type definition for `legendText`, which is currently set to only accept strings. This restriction prevents the use of other React components, such as `Tooltip`, as the value for `legendText`.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

- `FormGroup.js`: This file defines the `FormGroup` component and its props, so it is the primary file that needs to be modified to allow non-string values for `legendText`.
- `Tooltip.js`: This file contains the `Tooltip` component that the user wants to use within `legendText`, so it is relevant for understanding how the `Tooltip` should be integrated.
- `FormGroup-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `FormGroup` component, which will need to be updated to reflect the new functionality.
- `Tooltip-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `Tooltip` component, which may need to be updated if changes are made to how `Tooltip` is used.
- `Tooltip-story.js`: This file contains stories for the `Tooltip` component, which may be useful for demonstrating the new functionality in a Storybook environment.
