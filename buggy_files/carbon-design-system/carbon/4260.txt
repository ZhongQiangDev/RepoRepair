### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates two accessibility violations related to the React Dropdown component:

1. **Invalid ARIA attribute values**: The `aria-owns` and `aria-controls` attributes on the dropdown button are pointing to an invalid ID (`carbon-dropdown-example__menu`), which does not exist in the DOM.
2. **Accessible name does not contain the visible label text**: The accessible name for the dropdown button does not include the visible label text, which can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand the purpose of the dropdown.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues appears to be:

- **Invalid ARIA attribute values**: The `aria-owns` and `aria-controls` attributes are likely being set with a hardcoded or dynamically generated ID that does not match the actual ID of the dropdown menu in the DOM. This could be due to a mismatch in how the ID is generated or assigned.
- **Accessible name issue**: The accessible name for the dropdown button is not being properly set to include the visible label text. This could be due to missing or incorrect ARIA attributes or a lack of proper association between the label and the dropdown button.
