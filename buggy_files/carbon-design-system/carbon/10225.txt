### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The GitHub problem description indicates that the current implementation of tabs does not support an "icon-only" variant for both Line Tabs and Contained Tabs. The images provided show the desired layout for these icon-only tabs, where only icons are displayed without accompanying text labels.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is likely due to the current implementation of the `Tab` and `ContainedTab` components not having the necessary logic or props to render an icon-only variant. This could involve missing conditional rendering logic that checks for the presence of an icon and the absence of a label, as well as the necessary styling adjustments to ensure the icons are properly aligned and spaced.

### 3. Related Files
Based on the repository information, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/next/ContainedTab.js
packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
```

These files are likely where the logic for rendering tabs and their variants is defined, and where the necessary changes to support an icon-only variant would need to be made. The test and story files are included to ensure that the changes are properly validated and documented.
