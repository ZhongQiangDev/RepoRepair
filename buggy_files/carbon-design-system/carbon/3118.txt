### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem description indicates that the React `<ComboBox>` selection element is including multiselect styles, which makes it appear broken. Additionally, the invalid state selection icon is positioned incorrectly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely stems from incorrect styling or class application within the `<ComboBox>` component. The multiselect styles being applied suggest that the component is either not correctly distinguishing between single and multiselect modes or is applying styles incorrectly. The incorrect positioning of the invalid state icon suggests a problem with the layout or CSS positioning rules.
