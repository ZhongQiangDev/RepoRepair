### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves accessibility violations in the React MultiSelect component. Specifically:

- The SVG icon used to clear the selection is missing a label or title attribute, leading to the violation: "The WAI-ARIA widget with IMG role must have a nonempty alternate text or a label."
- The checkbox inputs and their associated labels are not properly grouped, resulting in the violation: "Use grouping roles or elements to identify related form controls."
- The interactive element (the button to expand the menu) does not have an accessible name, leading to the violation: "An interactive element/widget must have an accessible name."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The causes of these violations are:

- **Missing Label for SVG Icon**: The SVG icon used for clearing the selection lacks a `title` or `aria-label` attribute, which is necessary for screen readers to understand its purpose.
- **Improper Grouping of Checkbox Inputs and Labels**: The checkboxes and their corresponding labels are not properly associated using `aria-labelledby` or `for` attributes, making it unclear for assistive technologies which label belongs to which checkbox.
- **Missing Accessible Name for Interactive Element**: The button that expands the menu does not have an accessible name, which is essential for screen readers to identify the button's purpose.

- `MultiSelect-story.js` contains the stories for the component, which might help in identifying the problem.
- `Checkbox.js` is responsible for rendering the checkboxes, which need to be properly grouped with their labels.
- `Button.js` is responsible for rendering buttons, which need to have an accessible name.
- `Icon.js` is responsible for rendering icons, which need to have proper labels or titles.
