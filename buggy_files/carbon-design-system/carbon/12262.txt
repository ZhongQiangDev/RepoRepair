1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the data table component is missing an `id` element that the `headers` attribute references. This is causing an accessibility issue as flagged by the IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the `headers` attribute in the table cells (`<td>`) referencing an `id` that does not exist in the document. This could be due to the `id` not being generated or assigned correctly when the table is rendered.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableExpandHeader.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableExpandRow.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js
   ```

   - `Table.js`: This file likely contains the main table component where the `id` generation and assignment should occur.
   - `TableHeader.js`: This file handles the table header cells, which may need to have the correct `id` assigned.
   - `TableExpandHeader.js`: This file manages the expandable header cells, which might also need to reference the correct `id`.
   - `TableExpandRow.js`: This file handles the expandable rows, which could be part of the issue if they reference the `id`.
   - `TableContainer.js`: This file manages the overall table container, which might be responsible for ensuring all necessary `id` elements are present.
