1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `...rest` props are being spread on the inner `<button>` element instead of the outer `<th>` element for sortable table headers. This causes props like `id` to be applied to the button rather than the table header, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is a misplaced `...rest` prop in the `TableHeader` component. For non-sortable headers, the `...rest` props are correctly spread on the `<th>` element. However, for sortable headers, the `...rest` props are spread on the inner `<button>` element instead of the outer `<th>` element.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBatchAction.js
   packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.js
   ```

   - `TableHeader.js` is the primary file where the issue occurs and needs to be fixed.
   - `DataTable.js` and `Table.js` are closely related as they use the `TableHeader` component and may be affected by the fix.
   - `TableBatchAction.js` and `TableSelectAll.js` are also part of the DataTable component suite and might rely on consistent behavior from `TableHeader`.
