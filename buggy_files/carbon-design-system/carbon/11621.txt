### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the search icon in the DataTable selection variant is misaligned and looks off when hovered over. The screenshots show that the search icon is not properly aligned with the other elements in the header, and its appearance changes in an unexpected way during hover.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The misalignment and hover behavior suggest a CSS issue. The problem could be due to incorrect styling rules applied to the search icon, such as incorrect positioning, padding, or margin values. Additionally, the hover effect might be applying styles that are not correctly aligned with the icon's original position.
