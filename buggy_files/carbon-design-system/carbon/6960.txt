1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that a long single line of text in a code snippet does not wrap and instead extends beyond the container, causing a horizontal scrollbar or overflow.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely due to the lack of text wrapping or word-break properties in the CSS styling of the `CodeSnippet` component. The current implementation does not handle long lines of text that exceed the container's width, resulting in the text overflowing instead of wrapping to the next line.
