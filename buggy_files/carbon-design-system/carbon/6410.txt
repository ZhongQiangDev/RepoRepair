### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the tab component currently switches to a dropdown variant when the browser screen width is reduced. This causes two main issues:
- The measurement for switching to a dropdown is based on browser width rather than the available width of the component.
- The dropdown variant is confusing for screen reader users and does not represent the tablist correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely due to the implementation of the `Tabs` component, which includes logic to switch to a dropdown variant when the screen width is below a certain threshold. This logic is probably based on a media query or a similar mechanism that checks the browser's width. Additionally, the component may not be considering the actual width of the tab container when making this decision.
