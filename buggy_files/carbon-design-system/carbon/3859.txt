1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The problem description indicates that inline links should have an underline by default to enhance accessibility. However, the current implementation may not be consistently applying this underline, especially in certain states or themes.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the CSS styles not being correctly applied or overridden in certain contexts. This could be due to missing or incorrect CSS rules for the inline link component, or the styles not being properly inherited or applied in all themes or states.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
