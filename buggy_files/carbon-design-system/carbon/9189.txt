1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the `BreadcrumbItem` component does not display the shark fin and offset correctly when an `OverflowMenu` is used within it. This is because the `displayName` property is not being set correctly, leading to the incorrect rendering of the overflow icon and offset.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause appears to be related to the `createComponentToggle` function from `ComponentToggle.js`. This function is used to conditionally render either a `next` or `classic` version of a component based on a feature flag. However, it seems that the `displayName` property is not being set correctly when the `OverflowMenu` component is wrapped in `ComponentToggle`. This results in the `BreadcrumbItem` component not recognizing the `OverflowMenu` correctly, leading to the incorrect rendering of the shark fin and offset.

- `ComponentToggle.js`: This file contains the `createComponentToggle` function, which is likely causing the `displayName` issue.
- `OverflowMenu.js`: This file contains the `OverflowMenu` component, which is being wrapped in `ComponentToggle` and is not being recognized correctly by `BreadcrumbItem`.
- `Breadcrumb.js`: This file contains the `Breadcrumb` component, which is the parent component of `BreadcrumbItem` and may be indirectly affected.
- `OverflowMenu-story.js`: This file contains stories for the `OverflowMenu` component and may provide additional context for testing and debugging the issue.
