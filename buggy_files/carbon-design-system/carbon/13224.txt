### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The problem description indicates that the current implementation of the contextual menu (now referred to as a "combo button") is taking up too much space in the local navigation. The goal is to replace the three buttons with a single combo button that can display the options in a dropdown menu, similar to the provided image.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the current implementation of the buttons is not optimized for space. The buttons are displayed inline, which takes up a significant amount of horizontal space. The proposed solution is to use a combo button that can collapse the options into a dropdown, reducing the space required while still providing access to all the options.
