1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that clicking the down arrow icon on the ComboBox component does not trigger the `onClick` function the first time it is clicked. As a result, the list of options does not appear. However, clicking the input field itself does trigger the `onClick` function and displays the list.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the `onClick` event is attached or handled for the down arrow icon. It's possible that the event listener is not properly set up for the arrow icon, or there might be a delay in initializing the event listener. Another possibility is that the event listener is only attached to the input field and not to the arrow icon.
