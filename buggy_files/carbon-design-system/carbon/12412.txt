### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The GitHub problem description indicates that the radio button implementation lacks a `readOnly` prop and the associated styles for read-only radio buttons. The images provided show the expected structure and color for both vertical and horizontal radio buttons, but there is no indication of how read-only radio buttons should look or behave.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the current implementation of the `RadioButton` component does not support a `readOnly` prop. This means that there is no mechanism to visually or functionally distinguish a read-only radio button from an editable one. The component needs to be updated to accept a `readOnly` prop and apply the appropriate styles and behavior when this prop is set.

```
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButton/RadioButton-test.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `RadioButton.js`: This is the main file where the `RadioButton` component is defined. It needs to be updated to include the `readOnly` prop and the corresponding styles.
2. `RadioButton.stories.js`: This file contains the stories for the `RadioButton` component, which will need to be updated to include a story for the read-only state.
3. `RadioButtonGroup.js`: This file defines the `RadioButtonGroup` component, which may need to be updated to handle the `readOnly` prop for its child `RadioButton` components.
4. `RadioButton.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton loading state for the `RadioButton` component. It may need to be updated to reflect the read-only state during loading.
5. `RadioButton-test.js`: This file contains the tests for the `RadioButton` component. New tests will need to be added to ensure the `readOnly` prop works as expected.
