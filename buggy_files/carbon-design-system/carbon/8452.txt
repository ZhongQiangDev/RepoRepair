1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the data table currently lacks a 40px (`md`) row height option, which is present in other components with size variants. The goal is to add this row height option to the data table for consistency.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of the `md` size variant in the styling or configuration of the data table component. This could be due to missing CSS rules, missing size options in the component's props, or a lack of corresponding logic to handle this size variant.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableHeader.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableBody.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableRow.js
```

### Explanation:
- **`Table.js`**: This file contains the main `Table` component, which manages styling options like sizes (`compact`, `short`, `tall`). Adding the `md` size variant would likely involve modifying this file.
- **`TableContainer.js`**: This file manages the container for the table and may need adjustments to support the new size variant, especially if it affects the overall layout.
- **`TableHeader.js`**: This file handles the table headers, which may need to be adjusted to accommodate the new row height.
- **`TableBody.js`**: This file manages the body of the table, where the row height would be applied. It may need updates to support the new size variant.
- **`TableRow.js`**: This file handles individual rows and would need to be updated to include the new `md` size variant for row height.
