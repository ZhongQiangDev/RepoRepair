### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `Multi-select` dropdown component is not displaying the correct styles or behavior when in a read-only state. Specifically, the component should visually match the enabled state but be non-interactive, and it should apply the appropriate styles for read-only components as described in the design system.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the component not correctly handling the `readOnly` prop. This could be due to:
- The component not applying the correct CSS classes or styles for the read-only state.
- The component not disabling interactive elements (like the dropdown arrow or selected tags) when `readOnly` is true.
- The component not adhering to the design system's specifications for read-only components, such as maintaining the same structure and spacing as the enabled state.
