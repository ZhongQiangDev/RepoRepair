### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the checkbox component needs a `readOnly` prop and styles for the read-only state. The current implementation lacks these features, leading to a lack of visual distinction and functional behavior for read-only checkboxes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `Checkbox` component does not currently support a `readOnly` prop or the associated styles for a read-only state. This means that when a checkbox is intended to be read-only, it does not visually or functionally behave as expected. The component needs to be updated to include this prop and the corresponding styles to ensure it meets the design system's requirements for read-only components.
