1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the current button sizes do not include the `xl` and `large` variants. The `GitHub Problem Description` specifies the need for buttons with `80px` height (`xl`) and `64px` height (`large`), which are not currently available.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of these size variants in the existing button component implementation. The current button component does not have the necessary logic or styles to support these new sizes.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
   packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
   packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js
   packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.Skeleton.js
   packages/react/src/components/ButtonSet/ButtonSet.js
   ``` 

   - `Button.js`: This is the main file where the button component is defined. It will need to be updated to include the new `xl` and `large` size variants.
   - `Button-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the button component, which will need to be updated to include stories for the new sizes.
   - `Button-test.js`: This file contains the tests for the button component, which will need to be updated to include tests for the new sizes.
   - `Button.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton component for the button, which may need to be updated to support the new sizes.
   - `ButtonSet.js`: This file contains the button set component, which may need to be updated if the button set needs to support the new sizes.
