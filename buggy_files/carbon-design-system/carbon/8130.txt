### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the **Content Switcher** component failing to meet the **WCAG 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast** requirement. Specifically, the light grey outline of the unselected tab does not achieve a 3:1 contrast ratio against the background, making it difficult for users to identify the component as a tab switcher, especially in a 2-tab implementation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the insufficient contrast between the light grey outline of the unselected tab and the background. This low contrast makes it challenging for users to visually distinguish the unselected tab, leading to confusion about the component's purpose and functionality. The lack of a clear visual boundary between the selected and unselected tabs further exacerbates the problem.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause of the issue are:

```
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher.js
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-story.js
packages/react/src/components/ContentSwitcher/ContentSwitcher-test.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js
```

**Explanation:**

- **`ContentSwitcher.js`**: This is the primary file where the `ContentSwitcher` component is defined. It manages the visual styles and states of the tabs, so any changes to the contrast or visual elements would need to be made here.
  
- **`ContentSwitcher-story.js`**: This file contains the stories for the `ContentSwitcher` component, which are used for visual testing and documentation. Adjustments to the contrast may need to be reflected in these stories to ensure consistency.

- **`ContentSwitcher-test.js`**: This file contains the tests for the `ContentSwitcher` component. After making changes to the contrast, these tests should be updated or reviewed to ensure the component still functions as expected.

- **`SideNav.js`**: While not directly related to the `ContentSwitcher`, this file manages the side navigation menu, which may also contain similar tab-like components. Ensuring consistent contrast across similar components is important for overall accessibility.

- **`HeaderContainer.js`**: This file manages the state of the side navigation menu, which could also include tab-like components. Ensuring consistent contrast across similar components is important for overall accessibility.
