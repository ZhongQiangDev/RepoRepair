1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `light` prop is not being passed down to the underlying `<Listbox>` component when using React listbox components. This results in the `bx--list-box--light` class not being applied when the `light` knob is set to `true` in the React dropdown story.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the `light` prop not being properly propagated from the higher-level React listbox components (like `Dropdown` or `ComboBox`) down to the `<Listbox>` component. This could be due to the prop not being included in the props being passed down or not being handled correctly within the component hierarchy.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js
packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
```

### Explanation:
- `packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`: This file likely contains the main `Dropdown` component where the `light` prop should be passed down to the underlying `Listbox`.
- `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`: Similar to `Dropdown`, this file might also need to handle the `light` prop if it's used in a similar context.
- `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBox.js`: This is the core `Listbox` component where the `light` prop should be applied to add the `bx--list-box--light` class.
- `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js`: This file might also need to handle the `light` prop if it affects the menu's styling.
- `packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js`: This file could be relevant if the `light` prop affects the styling of individual menu items.
