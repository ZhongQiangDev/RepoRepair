### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The problem described involves a button inside another button, which violates the W3C HTML5 specification that states "there must be no interactive content descendant." Specifically, the "Clear Selection" button is nested inside the main button of the `MultiSelect` component, leading to accessibility issues and potential confusion for screen reader users and keyboard navigation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the way the `MultiSelect` component is structured. The `MultiSelect` component is rendering a button that contains another button, which is not compliant with HTML standards. This structure can lead to unexpected behavior, such as difficulty in focusing on the nested button, incorrect tab order, and issues with screen readers interpreting the content.
