### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two main issues:
1. The `aria-expanded` attribute is not allowed on the `ExpandableTile` component when it is rendered as a button.
2. The need to add a fake interactive element to force the expandable tile to render the interactive version, which is not ideal.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of these issues is likely related to how the `ExpandableTile` component handles its rendering based on the presence of interactive content. When the `StructuredList` is placed inside the `ExpandableTile`, it doesn't have interactive content, causing the tile to render as a button. This button rendering prevents the use of the `aria-expanded` attribute, leading to the accessibility violation. Additionally, the workaround of adding a fake interactive element suggests a limitation in the component's logic for determining when to render the interactive version.

packages/react/src/components/StructuredList/StructuredList.js
packages/react/src/components/StructuredList/StructuredList-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.stories.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `Tile.tsx` and `Tile-test.js` contain the core logic and tests for the `ExpandableTile` component, which is the primary source of the issue.
- `StructuredList.js` and `StructuredList-test.js` define the `StructuredList` component, which is being placed inside the `ExpandableTile` and may influence its rendering behavior.
- `Tile.stories.js` contains the storybook configurations for the `ExpandableTile`, which can help in understanding the component's intended usage and behavior.
