### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `aria-label` provided to the `Toggle` component is not being read by the screen reader (VoiceOver). Instead, the screen reader announces the `labelA` and `labelB` props, which are not intended for screen reader use. This indicates that the `aria-label` is not being properly applied or recognized by the screen reader.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `aria-label` attribute is being applied to the `Toggle` component. The `aria-label` might not be correctly bound to the relevant DOM element, or there could be a conflict with other attributes like `labelA` and `labelB`. Additionally, the `Toggle` component might not be properly forwarding the `aria-label` prop to the underlying DOM element.

- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js`: This is the main implementation of the `Toggle` component. It is crucial to check how the `aria-label` prop is being handled and applied to the DOM element.
- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the `Toggle` component, which can help in understanding how the component is intended to be used and configured.
- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js`: This file contains the tests for the `Toggle` component. Reviewing these tests can help identify if the `aria-label` functionality is being tested and if there are any gaps in the testing.
- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton version of the `Toggle` component. While less likely to be directly related, it might still be relevant if the skeleton component is interfering with the main component.
- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/ToggleSmall.js`: This file contains a deprecated version of the `Toggle` component. It might be relevant if the issue is related to a deprecated feature or if the deprecated component is still being used in some contexts.
