### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `NumberInput` component is not displaying the correct styles when the `readOnly` prop is applied. Specifically, the component is not visually indicating that it is in a read-only state, which should match the structure and spacing of the enabled component but with distinct visual cues (e.g., different colors or disabled controls).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the component not properly handling the `readOnly` prop. This could be due to:
- The `readOnly` prop not being correctly passed down to the underlying input element.
- The CSS styles not being applied correctly for the read-only state.
- The component's logic not accounting for the `readOnly` state when rendering the UI.
