1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the Component API tables for various UIShell storybook components are not rendering properly. Instead of displaying the expected API details, the tables show "undefined" for the content.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from an issue in how the component API data is being fetched or rendered within the Storybook setup. This could be due to:
   - Incorrect or missing data being passed to the component API table.
   - A bug in the Storybook configuration that prevents the API data from being loaded correctly.
   - An issue with the component's documentation or metadata that Storybook relies on to generate the API tables.
