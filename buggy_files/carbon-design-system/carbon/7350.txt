### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description suggests the need for a context menu component that can be used as an enhanced overflow menu. The wrong behavior involves the lack of a context menu component in the current system, which limits user interaction and navigation options, especially in complex and data-heavy web applications.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the wrong behavior is the absence of a dedicated context menu component in the existing codebase. Currently, the application relies on overflow menus, which may not provide the same level of flexibility and user experience as a context menu. The context menu is expected to offer a more intuitive way for users to interact with elements, providing options directly related to the context of their current action.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause from `Repository Information`

```
packages/components/src/components/floating-menu/floating-menu.js
packages/components/src/components/overflow-menu/overflow-menu.js
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js
packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenuItem.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

- `floating-menu.js`: This file contains the `FloatingMenu` class, which is likely the closest existing component to a context menu. It manages positioning and visibility, which are crucial for a context menu.
- `overflow-menu.js`: The `OverflowMenu` component is currently used for similar purposes and can serve as a reference or base for the new context menu.
- `Tooltip.js`: Tooltips and context menus share some common features, such as appearing on user interaction and providing additional information or options.
- `ListBoxMenu.js` and `ListBoxMenuItem.js`: These files handle menu items and their interactions, which are essential for the options within a context menu.
