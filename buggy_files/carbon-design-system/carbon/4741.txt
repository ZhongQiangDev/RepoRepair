### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that the copy button in the CodeSnippet component is not positioned correctly in `single` mode. Specifically, the `.bx--copy-btn` class is overriding the `position` style to `relative` instead of the expected `absolute`, causing the button to be misaligned.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely related to the CSS styles applied to the `.bx--copy-btn` class. The `position` property is being set to `relative` instead of `absolute`, which affects the button's placement relative to its parent element. This could be due to the order of CSS imports or a conflict between the `code-snippet` and `copy-button` components' styles.

2. **`CopyButton.js`**: This file contains the implementation of the `CopyButton` component, which is responsible for the copy functionality and its styling. The issue might be related to how the `CopyButton` is styled within the `CodeSnippet`.

3. **`CodeSnippet-story.js`**: This file contains the Storybook stories for the `CodeSnippet` component. It might provide additional context on how the component is used and styled in different scenarios, which could help identify the issue.

4. **`CodeSnippet-test.js`**: This file contains the unit tests for the `CodeSnippet` component. Reviewing the tests might reveal if there are any specific cases where the positioning of the copy button is being tested and could help pinpoint the issue.

5. **`CopyButton-story.js`**: This file contains the Storybook stories for the `CopyButton` component. Similar to `CodeSnippet-story.js`, it might provide additional context on how the `CopyButton` is used and styled, which could help in understanding the positioning issue.
