1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that clicking the "Show Code" button under the "Docs" section of the Notifications component results in the display of `<FeatureFlags>` tags instead of the actual code for the Notifications component.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from a misconfiguration or bug in the code that handles the "Show Code" button's functionality. Specifically, the code being displayed is not correctly linked to the Notifications component but instead shows the `<FeatureFlags>` wrapper code. This could be due to incorrect mapping of the code snippets, a problem with the code fetching mechanism, or an issue with the component's documentation setup.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```

- `packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js`: This file contains the main implementation of the Notifications component, which is likely where the actual code should be displayed.
- `packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the Notifications component, which might include the setup for the "Show Code" button.
- `packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification-test.js`: This file contains tests for the Notifications component, which might help identify if there are any issues with the component's implementation.
- `packages/react/src/components/FeatureFlags/FeatureFlags.js`: This file contains the implementation of the FeatureFlags component, which is being displayed instead of the Notifications component's code.
- `packages/react/src/components/FeatureFlags/index.js`: This file might contain the export of the FeatureFlags component and could be related to how the code snippets are being fetched or displayed.
