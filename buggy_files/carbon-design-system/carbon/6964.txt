1. **Wrong Behavior**: The `Tabs` component is generating HTML that includes `role="navigation"` on the tablist, which is not appropriate for a tab component. This can cause accessibility issues, as it incorrectly labels the tablist as a navigation landmark.

2. **Cause**: The `role="navigation"` is being explicitly set in the `Tabs` component's props. This is likely due to a leftover or incorrect configuration in the component's implementation or in the storybook setup.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.config.js
