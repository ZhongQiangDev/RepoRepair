1. **Wrong Behavior**: The ordered list is starting at a random number (7 in this case) instead of starting at 1. This issue is specific to Firefox.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue arises from the custom CSS counter reset applied by Carbon's styles. The `counter-reset: item` property on the `ol` element is causing the list to start at a non-sequential number in Firefox. This is likely due to how Firefox handles the counter reset in combination with the `::before` pseudo-element used for numbering.
