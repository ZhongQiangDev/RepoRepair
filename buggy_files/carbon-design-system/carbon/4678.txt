1. **Wrong Behavior**: The screen reader is not correctly reading the label text for the radio button in the React version, whereas it reads the label correctly in the vanilla HTML version. In the React version, the screen reader only announces "selected, radio button, 1 of 3" without the label text.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue appears to be related to the `aria-label` attribute in the React version. The vanilla HTML version uses a `label` element with a `for` attribute that correctly associates the label text with the radio button. In contrast, the React version uses an `aria-label` attribute, which is not needed and may be interfering with the screen reader's ability to correctly associate and read the label text.
