### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described involves the implementation of field validation errors for a `RadioGroup`. The states needed are:
- Invalid (error)
- Warn
- Helper text

The current implementation does not seem to handle these states correctly, as the provided screenshot shows the expected visual styles and states for a `RadioGroup` with validation errors, warnings, and helper text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely lies in the lack of proper state management and conditional rendering for the `RadioGroup` component. The component needs to dynamically apply styles and display appropriate messages based on the current validation state (invalid, warn, helper). This requires:
- Proper state management within the `RadioGroup` component.
- Conditional rendering of error, warning, and helper text based on the state.
- Styling adjustments to match the design specifications.

packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.stories.js
```

**Explanation:**
- `RadioButtonGroup.js`: This is the main component that needs to manage the validation states and apply the appropriate styles and messages.
- `RadioButton.js`: Individual radio buttons need to be aware of the group's validation state and render accordingly.
- `RadioButton.stories.js`: This file contains examples and tests for the `RadioButton` component, which can be used to validate the implementation.
- `FormGroup.js`: The `FormGroup` component may be used to wrap the `RadioButtonGroup` and manage form-level validation.
- `FormGroup.stories.js`: This file contains examples and tests for the `FormGroup` component, which can help ensure the validation logic is correctly integrated.
