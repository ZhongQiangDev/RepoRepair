1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The SideNav does not close when a `SideNavLink` is clicked.
   - The SideNav does not close when clicking on the overlay or the menu bar outside the SideNav.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from the lack of event handling for closing the SideNav when a `SideNavLink` is clicked or when clicking outside the SideNav (on the overlay or menu bar). The current implementation may not be properly managing the `isSideNavExpanded` state in these scenarios.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

- `packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js`: This file manages the SideNav component's state and expansion behavior. It likely needs modifications to handle the closing of the SideNav when a `SideNavLink` is clicked or when clicking outside the SideNav.
- `packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavLink.js`: This file defines the `SideNavLink` component. It may need to include logic to notify the `SideNav` component to close when a link is clicked.
- `packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderContainer.js`: This file manages the state of the side navigation menu. It may need to be updated to handle the closing of the SideNav when clicking outside.
- `packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenuButton.js`: This file defines the button that toggles the SideNav. It may need to be involved in the logic for closing the SideNav when clicking outside.
- `packages/react/src/internal/ClickListener.js`: This utility class can help detect clicks outside the SideNav, which is necessary for closing the SideNav when clicking on the overlay or menu bar.
