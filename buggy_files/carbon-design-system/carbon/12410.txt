### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the slider component is not displaying the correct visual styles when in a read-only state. Specifically, the slider thumb (handle) should not be visible in read-only mode, but it is currently being displayed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the component not correctly applying the read-only state styles. This could be due to:
- The read-only state not being properly detected or applied in the component's logic.
- The CSS styles for the read-only state not being correctly defined or applied.
- The component's structure not being updated to hide the slider thumb when in read-only mode.

```
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.js
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/Slider/Slider.Skeleton.stories.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `Slider.js` contains the core logic and rendering of the Slider component, where the read-only state logic would be implemented.
- `Slider.stories.js` provides examples and configurations for the Slider component, which can help in identifying how the read-only state should be applied.
- `Slider-test.js` contains tests that validate the component's behavior, including the read-only state.
- `Slider.Skeleton.js` and `Slider.Skeleton.stories.js` handle the skeleton loading state, which might also be relevant if the issue is related to state management.
