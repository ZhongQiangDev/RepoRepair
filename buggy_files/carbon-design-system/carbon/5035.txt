1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The container tabs are not truncating text with an ellipsis when the text exceeds a certain length, unlike the default tabs. The text should be truncated with an ellipsis 16px from the edge.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from missing CSS styles or class names that handle text truncation for the container tabs. The default tabs have the necessary styles applied, but the container tabs do not.
