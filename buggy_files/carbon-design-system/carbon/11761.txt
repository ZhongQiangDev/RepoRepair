1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `TableContainer` does not define IDs for its title and description nodes, preventing the `DataTable` from being properly labeled or described using `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`. This results in screen readers either using the table's rows to label it or requiring the use of `aria-label`, which is not recommended by ARIA guidelines.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the `TableContainer` component does not generate unique IDs for its title and description elements. Without these IDs, the `DataTable` cannot reference them via `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby`, leading to accessibility issues. The `TableContainer` needs to generate and assign unique IDs to its title and description elements so they can be referenced by the `DataTable`.
