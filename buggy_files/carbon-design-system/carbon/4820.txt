### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behaviors identified in the `GitHub Problem Description` are:

1. **Accessible Name Mismatch**: The accessible name of the dropdown does not match or contain the visible label text, leading to accessibility issues.
2. **Contrast Violation**: The contrast between the foreground and background colors does not meet the WCAG AA requirements, affecting readability.
3. **Form Validation Error**: The dropdown menu is not accepting a valid value, indicating a form validation issue.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

- **Accessible Name Mismatch**: This issue likely arises from incorrect or missing ARIA attributes, such as `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`, which should reference the visible label text. The label text "This is not a dropdown title" does not match the accessible name.
  
- **Contrast Violation**: The issue is due to insufficient color contrast between the text and background. The current contrast ratio of 1.71 is too low for text of size 12px and weight 400, failing to meet the WCAG AA requirement of at least 4.5:1 for normal text.

- **Form Validation Error**: The dropdown menu is not accepting a valid value, which could be due to incorrect form validation logic or missing required attributes on the dropdown element.
