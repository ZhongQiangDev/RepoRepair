1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when a filterable multiselect component has some options selected, clicking on the `<input>` element (the filter field) puts the focus outline on the wrong node. Specifically, the focus outline appears around the `<input>` element instead of the entire multiselect control.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The focus outline is likely being applied to the `<input>` element because it is the direct target of the click event. This suggests that the event handling or focus management logic within the multiselect component is not correctly identifying the entire control as the focus target. The component may need to adjust how it handles focus events to ensure the entire control is focused instead of just the `<input>`.

- `FilterableMultiSelect.js`: This file contains the core logic for the filterable multiselect component, including event handling and focus management. It is the most relevant file as it directly controls the behavior of the filterable multiselect.
- `MultiSelect.js`: This file contains the base multiselect component logic, which may include shared focus and event handling that could be affecting the filterable version.
- `Checkbox.js`: The checkbox component is used within the multiselect to represent individual options. Its focus and event handling logic may be relevant to the overall focus behavior.
- `TextInput.js`: The text input component is used for the filter field within the multiselect. Its focus handling logic could be influencing the issue.
- `Select.js`: The select component shares some similarities with the multiselect and may have relevant focus management logic that could be referenced or adapted.
