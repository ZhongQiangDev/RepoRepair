### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the Carbon Design System needs to add expressive list and button components with updated styles. Specifically:

- **Expressive List**: The list should use a 16px font size with a 24px line height, using the `$body-long-02` token.
- **Expressive Button**: The button should have a 16px font size with a 48px button height.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the list and button components in the Carbon Design System does not match the new expressive design requirements. The existing components are using different font sizes, line heights, and button heights, which leads to inconsistency with the new design guidelines.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files that need to be edited to fix the issue are:

```
packages/react/src/components/OrderedListItem/OrderedListItem.js
packages/react/src/components/UnorderedListItem/UnorderedListItem.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js
```

These files are the most relevant because they define the list and button components and their styles, which need to be updated to meet the new expressive design requirements.
