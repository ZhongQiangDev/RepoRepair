1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that when the `pagesUnknown` prop is set to `true`, the pagination component displays the page number twice: once in the dropdown select element and again as text next to it. This redundancy is unnecessary and can be confusing for users.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely lies in how the pagination component is rendering the page number. When `pagesUnknown` is `true`, the component might be incorrectly concatenating or rendering the page number in two separate places instead of just displaying it once.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/PageSelector.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.Skeleton.js
```

These files are most likely related to the pagination component's implementation and rendering logic. The `Pagination.js` file contains the main component logic, `Pagination.stories.js` provides examples and configurations, `PageSelector.js` handles the page selection UI, `Pagination-test.js` contains tests that might help identify the issue, and `Pagination.Skeleton.js` handles the skeleton loading state.
