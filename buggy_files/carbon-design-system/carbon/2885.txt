1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that VoiceOver does not announce the "On" or "Off" labels when the toggle component is interacted with. This indicates that the screen reader is not recognizing the labels correctly.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause appears to be the presence of `aria-hidden="true"` on the span elements containing the "On" and "Off" labels. This attribute hides the content from screen readers, preventing VoiceOver from announcing the labels. Removing `aria-hidden="true"` allows the labels to be read by screen readers.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js
packages/icon-helpers/src/getAttributes.js
```

- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js`: This file contains the main implementation of the Toggle component, where the `aria-hidden` attribute is likely applied. It is the most critical file to address the issue.
- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton version of the Toggle component, which might also need to be checked for similar issues.
- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-story.js`: This file contains stories for the Toggle component, which can be used to test the changes and ensure the fix works as expected.
- `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js`: This file contains tests for the Toggle component, which should be updated to verify the fix.
- `packages/icon-helpers/src/getAttributes.js`: This file might be indirectly related if it affects how attributes are set on icons within the Toggle component.
