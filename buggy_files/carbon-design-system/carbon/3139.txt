### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates two main accessibility issues with the React Dropdown component:

1. **Invalid ARIA Attribute Values**: The `aria-owns` and `aria-controls` attributes on the dropdown button are pointing to an invalid ID (`carbon-dropdown-example__menu`), which does not exist in the DOM.
2. **Accessible Name Does Not Contain Visible Label Text**: The accessible name of the dropdown does not include the visible label text, which can make it difficult for screen reader users to understand the purpose of the dropdown.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues stem from incorrect ARIA attribute values and missing accessible name text:

- **Invalid ARIA Attribute Values**: The `aria-owns` and `aria-controls` attributes should reference the ID of the dropdown menu element. If the ID is incorrect or the element does not exist, the ARIA attributes will be invalid.
- **Accessible Name Issue**: The accessible name for the dropdown should include the visible label text to ensure screen reader users understand the dropdown's purpose. This might be due to missing or incorrect `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` attributes.
