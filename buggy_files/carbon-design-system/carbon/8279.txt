### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a user performs a multi-selection using the Shift key, the selected state of the last selected item can become out of sync. Specifically, if the last selected item was previously selected, it gets deselected even though the `selected` prop indicates it should remain selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue seems to stem from how the `SelectableTile` component handles the selected state when a user clicks on a tile while holding the Shift key. The component may not be correctly respecting the `selected` prop value when updating its internal state during multi-selection. This could be due to a logic error in the event handling or state management within the `SelectableTile` component.
