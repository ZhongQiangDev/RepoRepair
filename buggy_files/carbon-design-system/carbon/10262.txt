1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `TooltipDefinition` component currently only accepts `string` values for the `children` prop. When other types of values (like React elements such as `<h2>` or `<p>`) are passed, it results in a console warning indicating an invalid prop type.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is the current PropType definition for the `children` prop in the `TooltipDefinition` component. It is set to only accept `string` values, which restricts the component from accepting other types like React elements. This limitation prevents the component from being used flexibly with different types of children.

- `TooltipDefinition.js`: This is the main file where the `TooltipDefinition` component is defined. It contains the PropType definition that needs to be updated to accept `PropTypes.node`.
- `TooltipDefinition-test.js`: This file contains the test cases for the `TooltipDefinition` component. The tests will need to be updated to reflect the new behavior.
- `TooltipDefinition-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the `TooltipDefinition` component, which will need to be updated to demonstrate the new functionality.
- `childrenOfType.js`: This file contains a custom prop validator that might be used to ensure the children prop is of the correct type. It may need to be adjusted or referenced in the `TooltipDefinition` component.
- `deprecate.js`: This file contains a utility function for deprecating props. While not directly related, it might be useful if the old string-only behavior needs to be deprecated in a future release.
