### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `Accordion` component currently aligns the chevron icon at the end of the heading by default. The goal is to add an `align` prop to allow users to specify whether the chevron should be aligned at the start or end of the heading. The default alignment should be at the start.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the `Accordion` component does not provide an `align` prop to control the chevron's position. The chevron is hardcoded to be aligned at the end of the heading. To fix this, we need to introduce the `align` prop and modify the component's rendering logic to conditionally position the chevron based on the prop's value.

### Explanation:

1. **`Accordion.js`**: This is the main file where the `Accordion` component is defined. It will need to be modified to accept the `align` prop and adjust the chevron's position accordingly.

2. **`AccordionItem.js`**: This file contains the `AccordionItem` component, which is responsible for rendering individual items within the accordion. The chevron's alignment logic will likely be implemented here.

3. **`Accordion-story.js`**: This file contains the stories for the `Accordion` component, which will need to be updated to demonstrate the new `align` prop.

4. **`Accordion.Skeleton.js`**: This file contains the skeleton loading state for the `Accordion` component. While it may not directly need changes, it should be reviewed to ensure consistency with the new `align` prop.

5. **`Accordion.test.js`**: This file contains the tests for the `Accordion` component. New tests will need to be added to verify the functionality of the `align` prop.
