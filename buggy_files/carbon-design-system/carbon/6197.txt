1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the labels in the `tall` data table headers are misaligned when sorting is enabled. Specifically, the alignment of the labels in the first column is different from the others when only the first column is sortable.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The misalignment likely stems from CSS styling differences between sortable and non-sortable columns in the `tall` size data table. When sorting is enabled, additional elements or styles may be applied to the first column header, causing it to shift or resize differently compared to the other headers.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

- `TableHeader.js`: This file is directly responsible for rendering table headers and likely contains the logic for applying styles and handling sortable headers. It is the most relevant file to address the alignment issue.
- `Table.js`: This file defines the main table component and includes props for controlling table size and sorting. It may contain styles or logic that affects header alignment.
- `TableContainer.js`: This file manages the container for the table and may include styles or layout configurations that influence header alignment.
- `tools/sorting.js`: This file contains utility functions for sorting, which might include styles or logic that affects the appearance of sortable headers.
- `DataTable.js`: This file is the main class for the data table and may contain overarching styles or configurations that impact header alignment.
