1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the skeleton text in the vertical ProgressIndicator is slightly too low next to the dotted circles. The expected behavior is for the text to be middle-aligned with the circles.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The misalignment likely stems from CSS styling issues, such as incorrect vertical alignment, padding, or margin settings applied to the skeleton text or the circles. The problem could also be related to the layout structure of the `ProgressIndicator` component, particularly in its skeleton state.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/next/ProgressIndicator.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/next/ProgressIndicator.stories.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js` contains the skeleton component where the issue is observed.
- `ProgressIndicator.js` defines the main `ProgressIndicator` component, which may include styles affecting the skeleton state.
- The story files (`ProgressIndicator.stories.js` and `next/ProgressIndicator.stories.js`) provide examples and configurations that might highlight the issue or help in testing the fix.
