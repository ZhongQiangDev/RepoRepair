### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the Overflow Menu component does not have a `--light` modifier, which results in poor visibility when the menu is displayed on a light background. The current design of the Overflow Menu does not adapt well to light themes, leading to a grey menu on a grey background, which is not user-friendly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the lack of a specific CSS class or modifier that adjusts the Overflow Menu's appearance for light themes. The current implementation of the Overflow Menu component does not include logic or styles to handle light theme variations. This means that the component's styling is not dynamic enough to adapt to different background colors or themes.

#### Explanation:

1. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`**: This is the primary file where the `OverflowMenu` component is defined. It contains the core logic and styling for the component. To implement the `--light` modifier, changes would need to be made here to add conditional styling based on the theme.

2. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-story.js`**: This file contains the stories for the `OverflowMenu` component, which are used for visual testing and documentation. Adding a story for the light theme would help in visualizing and testing the new modifier.

3. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-test.js`**: This file contains the unit tests for the `OverflowMenu` component. Tests would need to be updated or added to ensure the new `--light` modifier works as expected.

4. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem.js`**: The `OverflowMenuItem` component is a child of the `OverflowMenu` and may also need adjustments to ensure it looks correct in a light theme. This file would need to be updated if the item's styling needs to change based on the theme.

5. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenuItem/OverflowMenuItem-test.js`**: Similar to the `OverflowMenu-test.js`, this file contains unit tests for the `OverflowMenuItem` component. Tests would need to be updated to ensure the items display correctly in a light theme.
