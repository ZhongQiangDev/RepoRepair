1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `FileUploaderButton` component has a `role` attribute on the `label` element, which is causing a DAP violation. The DAP violation indicates that elements using the `role` attribute must reference a valid WAI-ARIA role.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The `role` attribute is being applied to the `label` element, which is not a valid use case according to WAI-ARIA standards. Labels should not have a `role` attribute unless it is necessary for a specific accessibility requirement. In this case, the `role` attribute is unnecessary and should be removed to resolve the DAP violation.
