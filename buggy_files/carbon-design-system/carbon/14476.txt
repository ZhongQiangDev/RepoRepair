1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The current implementation of the `TableBatchActions` component does not include a "Select all" button to allow users to select all items across all pages. The feature request is to add this functionality.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The `TableBatchActions` component currently only displays the number of selected items and does not provide an option to select all items. This is likely because the component does not have the necessary logic or UI element to trigger a "Select all" action.
