### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that VoiceOver does not announce the correct number of tabs when navigating through them. Instead of announcing the current tab as part of the total number of tabs (e.g., "1 of 4"), it always announces "1 of 1".

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the way the `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` ARIA attributes are being set or managed within the tab component. These attributes are crucial for screen readers to understand the position of the current tab within the total number of tabs. If these attributes are not correctly set or updated, VoiceOver will not announce the correct tab count.

### Explanation:

1. **`packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js`**: This file contains the main `Tabs` component, which manages the overall tab group. It is likely responsible for setting the `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` attributes on the tab elements.

2. **`packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab.js`**: This file contains the `Tab` component, which represents an individual tab. It should be responsible for setting the `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` attributes on each tab element.

3. **`packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-test.js`**: This file contains tests for the `Tabs` component. Reviewing these tests can help identify if the `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` attributes are being correctly set and updated.

4. **`packages/react/src/components/Tab/Tab-test.js`**: This file contains tests for the `Tab` component. Similar to the `Tabs-test.js`, these tests can help ensure that the individual tab components are correctly managing their ARIA attributes.

5. **`packages/react/src/components/Tabs/tabs.config.js`**: This file may contain configuration options or constants used by the `Tabs` component. It could include settings related to ARIA attributes or other accessibility features.
