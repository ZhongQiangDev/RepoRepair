### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the select component needs to have a warning state added. The current implementation lacks the visual and functional elements necessary to display a warning state, such as a warning icon, appropriate styling, and a warning message.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `Select` component does not currently support a warning state. This means that the component's styling, icon handling, and state management logic do not include the necessary features to display a warning state. The component needs to be updated to include these features, such as adding a warning icon, applying specific CSS classes for the warning state, and handling the display of a warning message.

packages/react/src/components/Select/Select-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/Select.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/Select/SelectItem.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

- `Select.js`: This is the main file where the `Select` component is defined. It will need to be updated to include the warning state logic and styling.
- `Select-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the `Select` component, which will need to be updated to include a story for the warning state.
- `Select-test.js`: This file contains the tests for the `Select` component, which will need to be updated to include tests for the warning state.
- `Select.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton loading state for the `Select` component, which may need to be updated to include a skeleton for the warning state.
- `SelectItem.js`: This file contains the `SelectItem` component, which may need to be updated if the warning state affects the individual items in the select dropdown.
