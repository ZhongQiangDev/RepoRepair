### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an `OverflowMenu` is used inside a `DataTable`, the keyboard navigation does not work as expected. Specifically, there are no visual indicators (such as focus outlines or highlights) to show which `OverflowMenuItem` is currently active when navigating with the arrow keys. This makes it impossible for users to select an option using only the keyboard.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the `OverflowMenu` component inside the `DataTable` is not properly handling keyboard events or applying the necessary styles to indicate focus. This could be due to a few potential causes:

- The `OverflowMenu` component might not be correctly forwarding keyboard events to its child `OverflowMenuItem` components.
- The `OverflowMenuItem` components might not be applying the correct focus styles when they receive keyboard focus.
- The `DataTable` component might be interfering with the keyboard event propagation or focus management.
