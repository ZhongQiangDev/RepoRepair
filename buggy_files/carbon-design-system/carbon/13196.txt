1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The `hideLabel` prop in the `Toggle` component does not hide the label as expected when set to `true`. Instead, it only hides the label visually but does not remove it from the DOM. Additionally, for the label to be truly hidden, the `aria-labelledby` prop must also be set, which seems unnecessary and restrictive.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The `hideLabel` prop is not functioning as intended because it only visually hides the label but does not remove it from the DOM. This is likely due to the implementation of the `hideLabel` logic in the `Toggle` component. Furthermore, the requirement for `aria-labelledby` to be set for the label to be truly hidden suggests that the component's accessibility logic is tied to this prop, which may not be necessary if the `for` attribute on the label is already A11Y compliant.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
   packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js
   packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js
   packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js
   packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js
   ```

   - `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js`: This is the main implementation file for the `Toggle` component and likely contains the logic for the `hideLabel` prop and its interaction with `aria-labelledby`.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js`: This file contains the storybook stories for the `Toggle` component, which can help in understanding the intended behavior and usage of the `hideLabel` prop.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js`: This file contains the test suite for the `Toggle` component, which can help in identifying any issues with the `hideLabel` prop and its interaction with `aria-labelledby`.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton loading state for the `Toggle` component, which may also be relevant if the issue is related to the visual hiding of the label.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js`: This file is listed twice but is important for understanding the component's behavior in different scenarios.
