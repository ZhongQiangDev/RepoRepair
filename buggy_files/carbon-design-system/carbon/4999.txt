### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves React throwing a warning about duplicate keys in the `ComboBox` component. Specifically, the warning indicates that two children have the same key, `Option`, which violates React's requirement for unique keys to maintain component identity across updates.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `itemToString` function is being used as the key for the `MenuItem` elements within the `ComboBox`. In the provided code, `itemToString` returns the `text` property of the item, which is the same (`'Option'`) for both items in the `items` array. This results in duplicate keys, leading to the React warning.

- **`ComboBox.js`**: This is the main file where the `ComboBox` component is defined. It likely contains the logic for rendering the `MenuItem` elements and applying keys.
- **`ComboBox-story.js`**: This file contains examples and configurations for the `ComboBox` component, which may include the `itemToString` function and its usage.
- **`ComboBox-test.js`**: This file contains tests for the `ComboBox` component, which can help identify and fix issues related to key uniqueness.
- **`ListBoxMenuItem.js`**: This file defines the `ListBoxMenuItem` component, which is likely used within the `ComboBox` to render individual menu items. Ensuring unique keys here is crucial.
- **`ListBox.js`**: This file defines the `ListBox` component, which is a parent component of `ComboBox`. It may also be involved in the rendering process and key management.
