### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `Dropdown` component displaying `[object Object]` as the title attribute when an icon is selected. This occurs because the `itemToString` function is being used to render the selected item, which returns an object instead of a string. This results in the title attribute being set to `[object Object]`, which is not the desired behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the `Dropdown` component is using the `itemToString` function to convert the selected item into a string for the title attribute. However, when an icon is selected, the `itemToString` function returns an object instead of a string. This is because the `itemToString` function is not designed to handle objects, and it is not being overridden to handle the selected item correctly.
