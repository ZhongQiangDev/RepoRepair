### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the application breaking when destructuring the `DataTable` components from `@carbon/react`. The error messages indicate that the components are not being recognized correctly, leading to issues like `type is invalid` and `expected a string or a class/function`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely related to how the `DataTable` components are being imported and used. When destructuring the components directly from `@carbon/react`, the application fails because the components are not being exported in a way that supports this import syntax. This suggests that the `DataTable` components might be exported as a default export or in a different structure that doesn't align with the destructuring syntax used.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause are those that define the `DataTable` component and its related components, as well as the build and export configurations for the `@carbon/react` package. Here are the most relevant files:

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableContainer.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/Table.js
packages/react/tasks/build.js
packages/react/src/index.js
```

These files are ordered by their importance in defining the `DataTable` component and its related components, as well as the build process that exports them.
