1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when a user searches for specific items in the data table and then clicks the "Select All" checkbox, it selects all items in the table instead of only the filtered/searched items.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the "Select All" checkbox interacts with the filtered data. The checkbox might be selecting all items in the original dataset rather than the filtered dataset that is currently displayed after the search.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableSelectAll.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/TableToolbarSearch.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/state/getDerivedStateFromProps.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/tools/filter.js
```

- `TableSelectAll.js`: This file contains the logic for the "Select All" checkbox. It needs to be modified to ensure it only selects the filtered items.
- `TableToolbarSearch.js`: This file handles the search functionality. It might need to pass the filtered data to the "Select All" checkbox logic.
- `DataTable.js`: This file manages the overall state and rendering of the data table. It might need to ensure that the filtered data is correctly passed to the "Select All" checkbox.
- `getDerivedStateFromProps.js`: This file might need to handle the state updates when the search is performed and ensure that the filtered state is correctly maintained.
- `filter.js`: This file contains the filtering logic. It might need to ensure that the filtered data is correctly passed to the "Select All" checkbox logic.
