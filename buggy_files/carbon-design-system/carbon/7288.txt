### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that the `onChange` event in the multiselect (dropdown) menu only triggers when a change occurs, but there is no event to indicate when the menu is opened or closed. This makes it difficult to determine if the user has finished their selection process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the current implementation of the multiselect component only provides an `onChange` event, which is triggered when the selection changes. There is no event specifically for detecting when the menu is opened or closed. This means that the application cannot determine when the user has finished interacting with the menu, which is necessary for enabling or disabling rows based on the selection.

### Explanation:

1. **`packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect.js`**: This is the main file for the `MultiSelect` component. It is where the core functionality of the multiselect dropdown is implemented, including event handling. Adding an `onMenuChange` event would likely be done here.

2. **`packages/react/src/components/MultiSelect/MultiSelect-story.js`**: This file contains stories and examples for the `MultiSelect` component. It can be used to test and demonstrate the new `onMenuChange` event once it is implemented.

3. **`packages/react/src/components/Dropdown/Dropdown.js`**: The `Dropdown` component is likely used within the `MultiSelect` component. If the `onMenuChange` event needs to interact with the dropdown menu's open/close state, this file may need to be updated.

4. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`**: If the `MultiSelect` component uses an `OverflowMenu` for its dropdown functionality, this file may need to be updated to support the new event.

5. **`packages/react/src/components/ListBox/ListBoxMenu.js`**: The `ListBoxMenu` component is used for rendering the menu items within the dropdown. If the `onMenuChange` event needs to interact with the menu items, this file may need to be updated.
