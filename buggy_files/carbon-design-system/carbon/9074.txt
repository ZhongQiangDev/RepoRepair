1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components do not currently support supplying a custom `id` to the `legend` element, which is necessary for the `aria-labelledby` attribute of the `fieldset` to properly reference it. This is essential for screen reader support.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the `FormGroup` and `RadioButtonGroup` components lack the ability to accept and apply a custom `id` to the `legend` element. This limitation prevents the `aria-labelledby` attribute from being correctly set, which is crucial for accessibility.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup.js
packages/react/src/components/FormGroup/FormGroup-story.js
packages/react/src/components/RadioButtonGroup/RadioButtonGroup-test.js
packages/react/src/components/FormField/FormField.js
```

- `FormGroup.js` and `RadioButtonGroup.js` are the primary components that need to be modified to support the custom `id` for the `legend`.
- `FormGroup-story.js` and `RadioButtonGroup-test.js` will need updates to reflect the new functionality and ensure it works as expected.
- `FormField.js` might also need to be reviewed if it has any dependencies or shared logic with `FormGroup` or `RadioButtonGroup`.
