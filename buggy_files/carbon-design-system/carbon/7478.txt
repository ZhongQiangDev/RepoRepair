### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `CodeSnippet` component does not have a disabled state. The user wants to display a placeholder for the `CodeSnippet` before the actual value is available, but the component currently lacks the ability to be disabled, which would prevent user interaction and provide a visual cue that the snippet is not yet ready.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the `CodeSnippet` component does not currently support a `disabled` prop or state. This means that there is no mechanism in place to visually or functionally disable the component when the value is not yet available. To fix this, the `CodeSnippet` component needs to be updated to accept a `disabled` prop and apply the necessary styles and behavior to indicate that it is disabled.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause from `Repository Information`

```
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-story.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/CodeSnippet-test.js
packages/react/src/components/CodeSnippet/util.js
```

These files are most relevant because:

1. `CodeSnippet.js`: This is the main implementation file for the `CodeSnippet` component. It will need to be updated to include the `disabled` prop and the corresponding logic and styles.
2. `CodeSnippet-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the `CodeSnippet` component, which will need to be updated to include a story for the disabled state.
3. `CodeSnippet.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton loading state for the `CodeSnippet` component. It may need to be updated to ensure it works correctly with the disabled state.
4. `CodeSnippet-test.js`: This file contains the tests for the `CodeSnippet` component. New tests will need to be added to ensure the disabled state works as expected.
5. `util.js`: This file may contain utility functions used by the `CodeSnippet` component. It may need to be updated if any utility functions are required to support the disabled state.
