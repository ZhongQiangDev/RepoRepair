1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The `ContentSwitcher` component does not visually contrast well on `ui-01` backgrounds, indicating that the current styling or theme settings do not provide sufficient visual distinction.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the lack of a `light` variant or prop for the `ContentSwitcher` component. This means the component does not adjust its styling to accommodate lighter background themes, resulting in poor visual contrast.
