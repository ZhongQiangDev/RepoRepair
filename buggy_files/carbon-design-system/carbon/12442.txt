1. **Wrong Behavior**: The `AccordionItem` components from `carbon-components-react` and the `Footer` component from `@carbon/react` are generating duplicate `id` attributes, specifically `accordion-item-1`, which leads to accessibility violations.

2. **Cause Analysis**: The issue arises because both `AccordionItem` and `Footer` components are using the same mechanism to generate `id` attributes, likely through a shared utility function such as `useId`. This results in the same `id` being generated for elements in different parts of the DOM, violating the uniqueness requirement for `id` attributes.
