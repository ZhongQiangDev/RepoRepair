### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `TimePicker` component not displaying the correct styles when in a read-only mode. Specifically, the read-only input fields do not match the design specifications shown in the images. The structure and spacing of the read-only components should mirror the enabled components, but they appear to be missing the appropriate styles.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the `TimePicker` component not applying the correct styles or classes when in read-only mode. This could be due to:
- Missing or incorrect CSS classes for the read-only state.
- The component not properly handling the `readOnly` prop and applying the necessary styles.
- The styles for the read-only state not being defined or imported correctly.
