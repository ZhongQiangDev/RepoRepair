1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the page selector in the pagination component becomes difficult to use when there are many pages. The dropdown menu for selecting a page extends beyond the browser window, requiring users to scroll up and down to find and select the desired page. This results in a poor user experience.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the pagination component using a `Select` dropdown for page selection. When there are many pages, the dropdown list becomes excessively long, causing it to overflow the browser window. The component does not provide an alternative method for selecting pages, such as a text input field where users can directly enter the page number.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
packages/react/src/components/Pagination/PaginationNav.js
packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js
packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js
packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js
```

- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js`: This file contains the main `Pagination` component, which is responsible for the overall pagination functionality. It likely includes the logic for rendering the page selector and handling page changes.
- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/PaginationNav.js`: This file contains the `PaginationNav` component, which manages the navigation between pages. It may include the dropdown or select component that is causing the issue.
- `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js`: This file contains the `TextInput` component, which could be used as an alternative for users to directly input the page number instead of selecting from a long dropdown.
- `packages/react/src/components/NumberInput/NumberInput.js`: This file contains the `NumberInput` component, which could also be used as an alternative for users to directly input the page number.
- `packages/react/src/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`: This file contains the `DataTable` component, which likely integrates the pagination functionality. It may need to be updated to support the new page selection method.
