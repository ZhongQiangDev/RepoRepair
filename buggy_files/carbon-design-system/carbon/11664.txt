### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior is that the `OverflowMenu` component is emitting a deprecation warning for the `light` prop, even though the `light` prop is not being used in the code.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The warning is likely being triggered by a default or internal prop value being set to `light` within the `OverflowMenu` component, even when the user does not explicitly pass the `light` prop. This could be due to a default prop value, a state initialization, or an internal logic that assumes the `light` prop is present.

```

### Explanation:

1. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`**: This is the main file where the `OverflowMenu` component is defined. It likely contains the logic that sets or checks the `light` prop, and where the deprecation warning is triggered.

2. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-test.js`**: This file contains the test suite for the `OverflowMenu` component. It can help identify if the tests are inadvertently setting the `light` prop or if the tests themselves trigger the warning.

3. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu-story.js`**: This file contains storybook stories for the `OverflowMenu` component. It might be setting the `light` prop in some of the stories, which could be causing the warning.

4. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/next/OverflowMenu.stories.js`**: Another storybook file for the `OverflowMenu` component. Similar to the previous story file, it might be setting the `light` prop.

5. **`packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/OverflowMenu.js`**: This file is listed twice because it is the most critical file to check for the issue. It is the core implementation of the `OverflowMenu` component and where the deprecation logic is likely defined.
