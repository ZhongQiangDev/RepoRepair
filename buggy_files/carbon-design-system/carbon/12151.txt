1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the fluid text input does not have a skeleton state, which is necessary to provide a visual placeholder during loading states. This skeleton state is missing from the original specification.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of a skeleton component specifically designed for the fluid text input. The existing skeleton components for other input types may not be compatible or styled correctly for fluid text inputs, leading to a lack of a consistent loading state.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

- `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton component for regular text inputs. It needs to be extended or modified to support fluid text inputs.
- `packages/react/src/components/FluidForm/FluidForm.js`: This file defines the fluid form layout. It may need adjustments to integrate the skeleton state for fluid text inputs.
- `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/TextInput.js`: This file contains the main text input component. It should be updated to include the skeleton state for fluid inputs.
- `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/next/TextInput.stories.js`: This file contains stories for text inputs, including the skeleton state. It should be updated to demonstrate the new skeleton state for fluid text inputs.
- `packages/react/src/components/TextInput/util.js`: This file contains utility functions for text inputs. It may need updates to support the new skeleton state for fluid text inputs.
