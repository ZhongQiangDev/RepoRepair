1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when a custom label like "All" is used for the page size in the Pagination component, the other labels in the Pagination component display as `NaN` (Not a Number). This occurs because the component expects numerical values for page sizes but receives a string ("All") instead.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely due to the Pagination component not properly handling non-numeric values for page sizes. When a custom label like "All" is provided, the component attempts to perform arithmetic or comparison operations that assume numerical values, leading to `NaN` when encountering a string.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/components/src/components/pagination/pagination.js

```

- `packages/components/src/components/pagination/pagination.js`: This file contains the core Pagination class, which likely handles the page size logic and needs to be updated to support custom labels.
- `packages/components/src/components/pagination-nav/pagination-nav.js`: This file contains the PaginationNav class, which might be responsible for rendering the page size dropdown and needs to handle custom labels correctly.
- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js`: This file contains the React-based Pagination component, which may need adjustments to support custom labels.
- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js`: This file contains experimental pagination logic that might also need to be updated for custom labels.
- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-test.js`: This file contains tests for the Pagination component, which should be updated to include tests for custom labels to ensure the fix works as expected.
