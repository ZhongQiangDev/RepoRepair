### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the toggle component is not behaving as expected when it is in a read-only state. Specifically, the toggle should be visually and functionally read-only but still be announced by screen readers, while not allowing the value to be changed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the toggle component not properly handling the `readOnly` prop. When `readOnly` is set, the toggle should:
- Be visually indicated as read-only (e.g., no hover or active states).
- Not allow user interaction (e.g., clicking or keyboard navigation should not change the state).
- Be announced by screen readers as read-only but still convey the current state (on/off).

The problem might be caused by:
- Incorrectly applying CSS styles for the read-only state.
- Not preventing default events (e.g., click or keydown) when `readOnly` is true.
- Not setting appropriate ARIA attributes to indicate the read-only state to screen readers.

```
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/Toggle.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/Toggle/ToggleSmall-test.js
```

These files are most relevant because:
- `Toggle.js` contains the core implementation of the toggle component, where the `readOnly` prop handling logic would be defined.
- `Toggle.stories.js` provides examples and configurations for the toggle component, which can help in understanding how the `readOnly` prop is intended to be used.
- `Toggle-test.js` contains unit tests for the toggle component, which can help identify if the `readOnly` prop is being handled correctly.
- `Toggle.Skeleton.js` might contain loading states or placeholder logic that could be related to the visual representation of the toggle.
- `ToggleSmall-test.js` contains tests for a smaller variant of the toggle, which might also include relevant `readOnly` prop handling logic.
