1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the pagination component overflows its container on smaller viewports, leading to a poor user experience where the pagination controls are not fully visible or are cut off.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The overflow issue likely stems from the pagination component not properly handling responsive design. This could be due to fixed widths, lack of proper flexbox or grid layout configurations, or missing media queries that adjust the layout for smaller screens. The component may not be considering the container's width when rendering its elements, causing it to exceed the container's boundaries.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js`: This is the main file where the Pagination component is defined. It likely contains the core logic and styling that needs to be adjusted to fix the overflow issue.
- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-story.js`: This file contains the Storybook stories for the Pagination component, which can be used to test and visualize the component's behavior across different viewports.
- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-test.js`: This file contains the test suite for the Pagination component, which can help ensure that any changes made to fix the overflow issue do not break existing functionality.
- `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.Skeleton.js`: This file defines the skeleton loading state for the Pagination component. While not directly related to the overflow issue, it may need to be updated if changes are made to the main component.
- `packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js`: This file contains the PaginationNav component, which is closely related to the Pagination component and may also need adjustments to ensure consistent behavior.
