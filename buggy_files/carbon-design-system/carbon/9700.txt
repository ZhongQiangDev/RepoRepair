1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the inputs within the modal are not spanning the full width of the modal as expected. Instead, they appear to be constrained to a smaller width, which is inconsistent with the desired layout.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to CSS styling that is not correctly setting the width of the input fields to 100% of their parent container. This could be due to missing or incorrect CSS rules, or possibly due to conflicting styles from other components or the modal itself.
