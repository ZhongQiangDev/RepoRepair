### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that the icon-only Tabs and ContainedTabs variants currently do not support two sizes: 40px (default) and 48px (large). The goal is to add a `size` prop to these components to allow for these two sizes.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is that the current implementation of the `Tabs` and `ContainedTabs` components does not include a `size` prop that can be used to adjust the size of the icon-only tabs. This means that the components are hardcoded to a single size, and there is no mechanism to dynamically change the size based on user input.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to this issue are those that define the `Tabs` and `ContainedTabs` components and their behavior. Here are the top 5 files, ordered by importance:

```
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/next/Tabs.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/Tabs-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Tabs/tabs.config.js
```

These files are likely to contain the core logic for the `Tabs` and `ContainedTabs` components, their configuration, and their testing. Modifying these files should allow for the addition of the `size` prop and the implementation of the two sizes as required.
