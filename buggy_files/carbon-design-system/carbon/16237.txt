### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves two main issues with the `RadioTile` component when used in a `TileGroup` with native form validation:

- **Issue 1:** The `required` attribute must be specified on each individual `RadioTile` instead of on the `TileGroup`. This is suboptimal because it requires repetitive markup and can lead to maintenance issues.
- **Issue 2:** The invisible underlying input is not positioned correctly, causing the validation error message to appear in an incorrect location relative to the tiles.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

- **Cause for Issue 1:** The `TileGroup` component does not handle the `required` attribute for its child `RadioTile` components. Instead, each `RadioTile` must individually specify the `required` attribute, which is not ideal for grouping behavior.
- **Cause for Issue 2:** The positioning of the underlying input element within the `RadioTile` component is incorrect. This causes the browser's native validation error message to appear in an unintended location, as shown in the images.

**Explanation:**

- `RadioTile.tsx`: This file contains the implementation of the `RadioTile` component. It likely needs modifications to handle the `required` attribute more effectively and to adjust the positioning of the underlying input element.
- `TileGroup.tsx`: This file contains the implementation of the `TileGroup` component. It may need changes to propagate the `required` attribute to its child `RadioTile` components.
- `RadioTile-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `RadioTile` component. It should be updated to include tests for the new behavior related to the `required` attribute and input positioning.
- `TileGroup-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `TileGroup` component. It should be updated to ensure that the `required` attribute is correctly handled by the group.
- `util.js`: This file may contain utility functions used by the `RadioTile` component. It might need adjustments if the input positioning logic is handled there.
