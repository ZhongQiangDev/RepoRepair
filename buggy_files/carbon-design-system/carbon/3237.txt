### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when a modal is open, the background (or parent element) still allows scrolling. This is not the expected behavior, as the background should ideally be fixed or disabled to prevent scrolling while the modal is active.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to the modal component's implementation. Specifically, the modal component may not be applying the necessary CSS styles or JavaScript logic to disable scrolling on the body or parent element when the modal is open. This could be due to missing or incorrect CSS classes, missing event listeners, or incorrect handling of the modal's open/close state.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information provided, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
packages/components/src/components/modal/modal.js
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal.js
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal-story.js
packages/react/src/components/Modal/Modal-test.js
packages/react/src/components/ModalWrapper/ModalWrapper.js
```

These files are directly related to the modal component's implementation and configuration in both the vanilla JavaScript and React versions of the Carbon Design System. They likely contain the logic for managing the modal's open/close state and the associated styles and event listeners that control scrolling behavior.
