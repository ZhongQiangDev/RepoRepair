1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the current design system lacks interactive tokens for `$link-inverse-active` and `$link-inverse-hover` for high contrast moments (tooltip, pop-over, notifications). These tokens are necessary to ensure proper visual contrast and interactivity in both light and dark themes.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is the absence of these specific tokens in the existing color system. The current tokens do not cover all necessary states for high contrast scenarios, leading to inconsistent or missing styles in components like tooltips, pop-overs, and notifications.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/themes/src/tokens.js
packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js
packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js
packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js
packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js
```

- `packages/themes/src/tokens.js`: This file is crucial for defining and formatting tokens. Adding the new inverse tokens here will ensure they are correctly structured and named.
- `packages/themes/tasks/builders/tokens.js`: This file generates the `_tokens.scss` file. Including the new tokens here will ensure they are properly documented and available in the Sass files.
- `packages/themes/tasks/builders/themes.js`: This file constructs the Sass theme files. Adding the new tokens here will ensure they are included in the theme configurations.
- `packages/react/src/components/Tooltip/Tooltip.js`: This file manages tooltips, which require the new inverse tokens for high contrast scenarios.
- `packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js`: This file manages notifications, another component that will benefit from the new inverse tokens for high contrast scenarios.
