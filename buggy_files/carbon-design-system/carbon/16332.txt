### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves inconsistency in the naming of the `ariaLabel` prop across different Carbon components. Some components accept `ariaLabel`, while others accept `aria-label`. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential accessibility issues when developers use these components.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this inconsistency likely stems from the gradual evolution of the Carbon components. Initially, some components might have been developed using the camelCase `ariaLabel` convention, while others were updated or developed later to follow the kebab-case `aria-label` convention as per the React and WAI-ARIA standards. This discrepancy needs to be addressed to ensure uniformity and adherence to best practices.
