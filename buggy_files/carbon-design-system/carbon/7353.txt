1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `<button>` elements within the Tabs component are not passing accessibility checks because they lack an associated label. This means that screen readers and other assistive technologies cannot properly identify or announce the purpose of these buttons.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the `<button>` elements in the Tabs component do not have an `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` attribute that associates them with a meaningful label. This is necessary for accessibility compliance, as it ensures that assistive technologies can correctly identify and announce the buttons' purposes.
