1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue described is that some Carbon components accept `ariaLabel` as a prop, while others accept `aria-label`. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential accessibility issues when developers use these components.

2. **Cause**: The cause of this inconsistency is likely due to a lack of standardization in the prop naming conventions across different components. Some components may have been developed or updated at different times, leading to the use of different naming conventions (`ariaLabel` vs. `aria-label`). Additionally, the React ecosystem generally prefers camelCase for props, but for ARIA attributes, the hyphenated form (`aria-label`) is the standard as per the WAI-ARIA specification.
