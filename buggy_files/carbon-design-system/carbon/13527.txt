1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when the sidebar retracts, the dropdown menu remains open, leading to a visual inconsistency where the dropdown appears disconnected from the sidebar.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from the sidebar's state management not properly syncing with the dropdown's visibility. When the sidebar retracts, the dropdown should also close, but it remains open. This could be due to a missing event listener or a state management issue where the dropdown's open state is not being updated when the sidebar's state changes.

- `SideNav.js`: This file manages the overall state of the side navigation, including its expansion and retraction. It likely needs to ensure that any dropdowns within it are also closed when the sidebar retracts.
- `SideNavFooter.js`: This file contains the button that toggles the sidebar's expansion. It might need to trigger an event to close any open dropdowns.
- `SideNavMenu.js`: This file manages the expandable/collapsible menu items within the side navigation. It should ensure that the dropdowns close when the sidebar retracts.
- `HeaderContainer.js`: This file manages the state of the side navigation menu and could be responsible for ensuring that the dropdowns close when the sidebar retracts.
- `SideNavItems.js`: This file renders the list of navigation items and might need to handle the closing of dropdowns when the sidebar retracts.
