1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the time picker component does not currently have a consistent error and warning state style. The design spec indicates that the error state should have a red border and icon, while the warning state should have a yellow border and icon. The current implementation lacks these styles and the warning state is not implemented at all.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to missing or incomplete CSS styles for the error and warning states in the time picker component. Additionally, the component may not be handling the logic to display the warning state when appropriate.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.js
packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.stories.js
packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker-test.js
packages/react/src/components/InlineLoading/InlineLoading.js
packages/react/src/components/InlineLoading/InlineLoading-test.js
```

- `packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.js`: This is the main file where the time picker component is defined. It likely needs updates to include the logic for the warning state and to apply the correct styles for both error and warning states.
- `packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker.stories.js`: This file contains the stories for the time picker component, which can be used to visualize and test the new error and warning states.
- `packages/react/src/components/TimePicker/TimePicker-test.js`: This file contains the tests for the time picker component. It should be updated to include tests for the new error and warning states.
- `packages/react/src/components/InlineLoading/InlineLoading.js`: This file contains the `InlineLoading` component, which might be used within the time picker for loading states. It could be relevant if the time picker needs to handle loading states alongside error and warning states.
- `packages/react/src/components/InlineLoading/InlineLoading-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `InlineLoading` component. It might need updates if the `InlineLoading` component is used in the time picker and needs to be tested in conjunction with the new states.
