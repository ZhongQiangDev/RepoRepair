1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the danger state of the button is not communicated to screen reader users. The button visually indicates a danger state, but there is no corresponding accessibility feature (like `aria-describedby`) to inform screen readers about this danger state.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the button lacks an `aria-describedby` attribute that references a visually hidden span containing the danger state information. This means that while the button visually communicates danger, it fails to do so for users relying on screen readers.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
   packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
   packages/react/src/components/TooltipIcon/TooltipIcon.js
   packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition.js
   packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/overflow-menu.js
   ```

   - `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`: This file defines the core `Button` component, where the `aria-describedby` attribute needs to be added.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js`: This file contains stories for the `Button` component, which should be updated to reflect the new accessibility feature.
   - `packages/react/src/components/TooltipIcon/TooltipIcon.js`: This file contains a component that manages tooltips, which could be used as a reference for implementing the `aria-describedby` pattern.
   - `packages/react/src/components/TooltipDefinition/TooltipDefinition.js`: This file contains a tooltip component that could be used to dynamically generate the hidden span with the danger state information.
   - `packages/react/src/components/OverflowMenu/overflow-menu.js`: This file contains the `OverflowMenu` component, which may also need similar accessibility updates if it includes buttons with danger states.
