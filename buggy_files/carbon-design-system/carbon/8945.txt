### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves an accessibility violation where the `FileUploaderDropContainer` component has a nested interactive control (`<input type="file">`) inside a container with `role="button"`. This violates the WCAG 2.1 checkpoint 4.1.2, as nested interactive controls are not announced correctly by screen readers, leading to potential confusion for users relying on assistive technologies.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the improper nesting of interactive elements. The `FileUploaderDropContainer` component is using a `<div>` with `role="button"` to wrap an `<input type="file">`. This structure is problematic because the `<input>` is an interactive element on its own and should not be nested inside another interactive element (`role="button"`). This nesting confuses assistive technologies and can lead to unexpected behavior for users.
