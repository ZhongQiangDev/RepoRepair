### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when two icon-only buttons are placed next to each other, and one is focused while the other is hovered, both tooltips become visible and overlap each other. This results in a poor user experience and visual clutter.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how tooltips are managed for icon-only buttons. Specifically:
- The tooltip for the focused button remains visible even when another button is hovered.
- The tooltip for the hovered button also becomes visible, leading to overlapping tooltips.
- There may be a lack of logic to hide the tooltip of the focused button when another button is hovered.
