1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the Combo box component does not have a read-only state implemented. The component should visually and functionally reflect a read-only state, similar to other components in the design system.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of a `readOnly` prop in the Combo box component's implementation. Without this prop, the component cannot switch to a read-only state, and the necessary styles and behaviors for read-only mode are not applied.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
   packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js
   packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-test.js
   packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.Skeleton.js
   packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js
   ```

   - `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`: This is the main implementation file for the Combo box component. It needs to be updated to include the `readOnly` prop and its associated logic.
   - `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.stories.js`: This file contains the stories for the Combo box component, which should be updated to include a story for the read-only state.
   - `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox-test.js`: This file contains the tests for the Combo box component. Tests should be added to ensure the read-only state functions correctly.
   - `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton loading state for the Combo box component. It may need updates to handle the read-only state if it affects the skeleton's appearance.
   - `packages/react/src/components/ComboBox/ComboBox.js`: This file is listed twice by mistake, but it is the main implementation file and is crucial for the changes.
