### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `DatePicker` component crashes when the `datePickerType="single"` prop is added. The error message indicates that `start.addEventListener` is not a function, suggesting an issue with event listener handling within the `DatePicker` component.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error message `TypeError: start.addEventListener is not a function` suggests that the `start` variable is not a DOM element or an object that supports the `addEventListener` method. This could be due to:

- The `start` variable being `undefined` or `null`.
- The `start` variable being of an incorrect type, such as a string or number, instead of a DOM element.
- A change in the component's structure or props handling during the Carbon 11 migration that affects how `start` is defined or passed.
