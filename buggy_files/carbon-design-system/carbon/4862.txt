### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is an **IBM 2.5.3 Label in Name violation** in a `DataTable` with a `Toolbar`. Specifically, the accessible name of the button in the toolbar does not match or contain the visible label text, which is a violation of accessibility standards.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `Toolbar` component is rendering its buttons and their associated labels. The `Toolbar` component may not be correctly setting the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes on the button elements, or the text content of the button may not be properly exposed as the accessible name. This mismatch between the visible text and the accessible name can lead to accessibility tools flagging violations.
