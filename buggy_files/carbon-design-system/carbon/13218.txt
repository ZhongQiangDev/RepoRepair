1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the `caption` prop is declared in the `ActionableNotification` component's `propTypes`, but it is not actually used or rendered within the component. As a result, when a user provides a value for the `caption` prop, nothing is displayed.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the `caption` prop is not being passed down to the relevant part of the component's JSX where it should be rendered. This means that while the prop is being validated, it is not being utilized in the component's template.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

   packages/react/src/components/Notification/ActionableNotification.test.js
   ```

   - `packages/react/src/components/Notification/Notification.js`: This file likely contains the main implementation of the `ActionableNotification` component where the `caption` prop should be used.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Notification/stories/ActionableNotification.stories.js`: This file contains the stories for the `ActionableNotification` component, which can be used to test and demonstrate the component's behavior.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Notification/ActionableNotification.js`: This file might contain the specific implementation of the `ActionableNotification` component.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Notification/ActionableNotification.stories.js`: Another file that contains stories for the `ActionableNotification` component.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Notification/ActionableNotification.test.js`: This file contains tests for the `ActionableNotification` component, which can help ensure that the `caption` prop is correctly implemented and used.
