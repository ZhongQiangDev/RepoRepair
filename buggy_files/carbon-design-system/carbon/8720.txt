### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the Carbon Design System lacks a Progress Bar component, which is needed to display the percent-complete status of a long-running process. The current Progress Indicator component is not suitable for this purpose as it is designed for illustrating steps in a process like a wizard.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the absence of a Progress Bar component in the Carbon Design System. The Progress Indicator component, which is currently available, is not designed to show the percent-complete status of a process. Instead, it is intended to guide users through a series of steps. To address this, a new Progress Bar component needs to be developed that can accurately represent the progress of a long-running task with a percentage indicator.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause from `Repository Information`

```
packages/components/src/components/progress-indicator/progress-indicator.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator-story.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator-test.js
packages/react/src/components/ProgressIndicator/ProgressIndicator.Skeleton.js
```

These files are related to the existing Progress Indicator component and would be relevant when developing a new Progress Bar component. The `progress-indicator.js` file in the `packages/components` directory is the core implementation of the Progress Indicator, while the `ProgressIndicator.js` file in the `packages/react` directory is its React counterpart. The story, test, and skeleton files provide additional context for how the component is used and tested, which can inform the development of the new Progress Bar component.
