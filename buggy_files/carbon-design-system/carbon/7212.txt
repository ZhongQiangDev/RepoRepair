1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that Storybook is emitting a prop type warning for the `Button` component when using the `danger-ghost` kind. The warning indicates that `danger-ghost` is not a valid value for the `kind` prop, as it is not included in the list of expected values.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the `Button` component's prop type validation not recognizing `danger-ghost` as a valid value for the `kind` prop. This could be because the `danger-ghost` value is either missing from the list of valid `kind` values in the prop type definition or there is a mismatch between the expected values in the component's prop type validation and the actual values being used in the stories.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js
packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.Skeleton.js
```

- `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.js`: This file defines the `Button` component and its prop types. It is the most relevant file as it contains the prop type validation for the `kind` prop.
- `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the `Button` component, including the `danger-ghost` kind. It is important to check if the story is correctly using the `danger-ghost` kind.
- `packages/react/src/prop-types/requiredIfValueExists.js`: This file contains a utility function for prop type validation. It might be indirectly related if the `Button` component uses this utility for its prop type validation.
- `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `Button` component. It can help verify if the `danger-ghost` kind is correctly handled in the component.
- `packages/react/src/components/Button/Button.Skeleton.js`: This file contains the skeleton component for the `Button`. It is less directly related but still part of the `Button` component's ecosystem.
