1. **Wrong Behavior**: The `HeaderMenu` component is using `javascript:void(0)` as an `href` value, which triggers a React warning indicating that future versions of React will block `javascript:` URLs for security reasons.

2. **Cause**: The `HeaderMenu` component is likely using `javascript:void(0)` as a placeholder `href` value for links that are meant to be non-navigational or to trigger JavaScript actions. This is a common practice but is being flagged as a security concern by React.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
