1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the `DatePicker` component in version 11 does not use `React.forwardRef`, preventing the ability to pass a `ref` to the component. This results in the warning message shown in the image, indicating that function components cannot be given refs.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely that the `DatePicker` component in version 11 has not been wrapped with `React.forwardRef`, which is necessary for forwarding refs from parent components to child components. Without `forwardRef`, the `ref` passed to the `DatePicker` is not properly forwarded to its underlying DOM element or another component.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.test.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.Skeleton.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/rangePlugin.js
packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePickerInput/DatePickerInput.js
```

- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.js`: This is the main file where the `DatePicker` component is defined. It needs to be updated to use `React.forwardRef` to fix the issue.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.test.js`: This file contains tests for the `DatePicker` component. The tests should be updated to ensure that the ref forwarding works as expected.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePicker.Skeleton.js`: This file defines the skeleton component for the `DatePicker`. It may need to be updated if the ref forwarding affects the skeleton component.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/plugins/rangePlugin.js`: This file contains plugins for the `DatePicker`. It might need to be checked to ensure that the ref forwarding does not interfere with plugin functionality.
- `packages/react/src/components/DatePicker/DatePickerInput/DatePickerInput.js`: This file defines the `DatePickerInput` component, which is used within the `DatePicker`. It should be checked to ensure that ref forwarding is properly handled within the input component.
