### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the following issues with the expandable tile component when using VoiceOver or JAWS:

- When entering the web area using `Control-Option-Shift-Down Arrow`, VoiceOver does not announce anything and does not focus on any element.
- The expand button is announced as "Expand button main" but does not include the button label and current state using `aria-expanded`.
- The "Below the fold content" is announced before the tile is expanded, which is incorrect.
- The "Below the fold content" is announced even when the tile is not expanded.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues seem to stem from the following causes:

- **Missing Focus Management**: The component does not properly manage focus when entering the web area, leading to VoiceOver not announcing any element.
- **Incomplete ARIA Attributes**: The expand button lacks the necessary `aria-expanded` attribute to indicate its current state (expanded or collapsed).
- **Incorrect Announcement Order**: The "Below the fold content" is announced prematurely, suggesting that the component does not correctly handle the visibility and focus of the content based on the tile's expanded state.
