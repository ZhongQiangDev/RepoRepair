1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The `iconDescription` should only be required when there are no children in the `TableBatchAction` component. However, it is currently being read by JAWS even when children are present. Additionally, the default value for `iconDescription` should be an empty string (`''`) instead of 'Add'.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from how the `TableBatchAction` component handles the `iconDescription` prop. It seems to be applying the `iconDescription` regardless of whether children are present. Also, the default value for `iconDescription` is not being set correctly, leading to the default 'Add' value being used.
