### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described involves the contrast of shadows in overflow menus and page overlays for modals in dark themes (G90 and G100). The current opacity values for shadows are too low, leading to insufficient contrast compared to the light themes. Specifically:

- **Overflow Menu Shadows**: The opacity for G90 should be increased to 70%, and for G100, it should be increased to 80%.
- **Page Overlay for Modals**: The overlay color should be changed to `#000000` with a transparency of 65%.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is likely related to the CSS styles applied to the overflow menu and modal components. The current opacity values for shadows and the overlay color are hardcoded or defined in a way that does not match the desired contrast levels for dark themes. This could be due to:

- Incorrect CSS properties or values being applied to the components.
- Missing or incorrect theme-specific styles for dark themes.
- Inconsistent use of theme variables or mixins that control the shadow and overlay properties.
