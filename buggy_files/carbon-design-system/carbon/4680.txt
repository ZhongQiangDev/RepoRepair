1. **Wrong Behavior**: The `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components are displayed as `Anonymous` in the React DevTools, indicating that they lack a `displayName` property. This makes it difficult to identify these components in the component tree during development and debugging.

2. **Cause**: The issue arises because the `HeaderMenu` and `SideNavMenu` components are likely wrapped in `React.forwardRef` without setting a `displayName` property. When a component is wrapped in `React.forwardRef`, it loses its original `displayName` unless explicitly set.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
