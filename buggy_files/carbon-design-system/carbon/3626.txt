1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue described is that when the rail (side navigation) is collapsed, the submenu remains expanded, causing additional whitespace and misalignment. Additionally, if a submenu item is focused or selected, its active state appears off because the submenu items are not visible in the collapsed state.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely related to the state management of the side navigation and submenu components. When the rail is collapsed, the submenu should also collapse to avoid the extra whitespace and ensure that the active state of submenu items is not visible in the collapsed state. This suggests a problem with the state synchronization between the rail and submenu components.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNav.js
   packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavMenu.js
   packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavLink.js
   packages/react/src/components/UIShell/HeaderMenu.js
   packages/react/src/components/UIShell/SideNavFooter.js
   ```

   - `SideNav.js`: This file manages the overall state of the side navigation, including whether it is expanded or collapsed. It likely needs to ensure that the submenu collapses when the rail collapses.
   - `SideNavMenu.js`: This file handles the submenu's behavior and should ensure it collapses when the rail collapses.
   - `SideNavLink.js`: This file manages individual links within the side navigation and should handle the active state correctly when the rail is collapsed.
   - `HeaderMenu.js`: This file might be involved in managing the overall menu state, including the side navigation.
   - `SideNavFooter.js`: This file might contain logic related to toggling the side navigation state, which could be relevant to ensuring the submenu collapses correctly.
