1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the VoiceOver screen reader reads dropdown items twice when navigating through them using keyboard navigation.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The duplication in voiceover reading suggests that there might be redundant ARIA attributes or multiple focusable elements within the dropdown items. This could be due to improper handling of ARIA roles, states, or properties, leading to the screen reader interpreting the same content twice.
   - Another possibility is that the component is not correctly managing the focus state or the `aria-activedescendant` attribute, which is crucial for single-item focus within a list.
