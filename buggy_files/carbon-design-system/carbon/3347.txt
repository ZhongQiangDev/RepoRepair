1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when the `danger` property is set to `true` on the `ComposedModal`, the left button (Cancel) is styled as `tertiary` instead of `secondary` as expected. This results in the button appearing gray instead of black.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause appears to be related to how the `kind` prop is being set for the left button in the `ComposedModal` component. Specifically, the conditional logic that determines the `kind` of the left button is setting it to `tertiary` when `danger` is `true`, instead of `secondary`.
