### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `onChange` event is not being fired for the `SelectableTile` component, while `handleClick` and `handleKeyDown` events are being triggered as expected. This indicates a problem with the event handling logic specific to the `onChange` event.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

Based on the provided code and the issue description, the `onChange` event handler is not being called when the `SelectableTile` is interacted with. This could be due to several reasons:
- The `onChange` event might not be properly bound or triggered within the `SelectableTile` component.
- There could be a mismatch in the event propagation or event bubbling mechanism.
- The `onChange` event handler might not be correctly implemented or might be missing in the component's event handling logic.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Given the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-test.js
packages/react/src/components/Tile/Tile-story.js
packages/components/src/components/tile/tile.js
packages/react/src/components/TileGroup/TileGroup.js
```

**Explanation:**
- `Tile.js`: This file contains the core implementation of the `Tile` component, including the `SelectableTile`. It is likely where the event handling logic for `onChange` is defined.
- `Tile-test.js`: This file contains tests for the `Tile` component. Reviewing these tests can help identify if the `onChange` event is being tested and if there are any issues with its implementation.
- `Tile-story.js`: This file contains the stories for the `Tile` component, which can be used to interact with the component and verify its behavior in different scenarios.
- `tile.js`: This file contains the implementation of the `Tile` component in the `carbon-components` package, which might be relevant if the issue is related to the underlying component.
- `TileGroup.js`: This file contains the implementation of the `TileGroup` component, which manages a group of `Tile` components. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how the `TileGroup` interacts with individual `Tile` components.
