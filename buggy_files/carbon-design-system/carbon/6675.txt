1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The pagination footer incorrectly displays "items" and "pages" in plural form even when there is only one item or one page. It should display the singular form ("item" and "page") when the count is one.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from the logic in the `Pagination` component that handles the display of item and page counts. The current implementation does not include conditional logic to switch between singular and plural forms based on the count.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js
   packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js
   packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-story.js
   packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js
   packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav-story.js
   ```

   - `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination.js`: This is the main file where the pagination component is defined. It likely contains the logic for rendering the footer and needs to be updated to handle singular/plural forms correctly.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/experimental/Pagination.js`: This file contains utility functions and a React component focused on pagination and item range display. It may also need adjustments to ensure correct singular/plural handling.
   - `packages/react/src/components/Pagination/Pagination-story.js`: This file contains stories for the `Pagination` component, which can be used to test the changes and ensure the singular/plural forms are displayed correctly.
   - `packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav.js`: This file contains the `PaginationNav` component, which might also be involved in rendering the pagination controls and could require similar adjustments.
   - `packages/react/src/components/PaginationNav/PaginationNav-story.js`: This file contains stories for the `PaginationNav` component, which can be used to test the changes and ensure the singular/plural forms are displayed correctly in this context as well.
