### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the current style expressions in the codebase do not support fetching the `id` property of a feature using an expression like `['get', 'id']`. Instead, they only support fetching properties from the `properties` collection of a feature, such as `['get', 'attributeName']`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is that the current implementation of style expressions is limited to accessing properties within the `properties` object of a feature. The `id` property of a feature is not part of the `properties` collection but is a separate attribute of the feature object. Therefore, the expression syntax `['get', 'id']` does not work as expected because it tries to access a property named `id` within the `properties` collection, which does not exist.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code that handles style expressions to include support for fetching the `id` property of a feature. The most relevant files are those that deal with style expressions and feature property access.

```
src/ol/render/canvas/style.js
src/ol/source/Vector.js
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
examples/geojson.js
examples/vector-label-decluttering.js
```

- `src/ol/render/canvas/style.js`: This file contains functions for constructing and evaluating style-related objects, including the logic for handling style expressions. It is crucial for modifying the expression evaluation to support the `id` property.
- `src/ol/source/Vector.js`: This file manages vector features and their properties. It is important for understanding how features and their `id` properties are handled.
- `src/ol/layer/Vector.js`: This file defines the behavior of vector layers, including how styles are applied to features. It is relevant for ensuring that the new expression support integrates correctly with layer rendering.
- `examples/geojson.js`: This example demonstrates how feature properties are accessed and styled, which can provide context for implementing similar functionality for the `id` property.
- `examples/vector-label-decluttering.js`: This example shows how feature properties are used in style functions, which can serve as a reference for integrating `id` property access into style expressions.
