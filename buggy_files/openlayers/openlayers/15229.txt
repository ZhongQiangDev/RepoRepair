### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that icons on the `WebGLPoints` layer are distorted when `icon-rotate-with-view: true` is used with a non-square viewport. The expected behavior is that the icons should be displayed without distortion.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The distortion likely occurs due to incorrect handling of the aspect ratio when rotating icons with the view in a non-square viewport. When the viewport is not square, the aspect ratio of the viewport affects how the icons are rendered, and if this is not accounted for, it can lead to distortion. The issue might be related to how the WebGL rendering pipeline handles transformations and rotations in relation to the viewport dimensions.

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/layer/WebGLPoints.js`**: This file defines the `WebGLPointsLayer` class, which is directly responsible for rendering point data using WebGL. It is likely where the issue originates, as it manages the overall rendering process for point layers.

2. **`src/ol/render/webgl/PointsLayer.js`**: This file contains the `WebGLPointsLayerRenderer` class, which handles the actual WebGL rendering of points. It includes methods for updating buffers and rendering frames, which are crucial for ensuring correct transformations and rotations.

3. **`src/ol/render/webgl/MixedGeometryBatch.js`**: This file manages the rendering of different geometry types, including points. It ensures synchronization and proper rendering of various geometries, which might be relevant if the issue involves incorrect handling of transformations across different geometry types.

4. **`src/ol/render/canvas/style.js`**: This file contains functions for building and validating style-related properties, including icon styles. While it is primarily for canvas rendering, it might have relevant logic for style properties that could be affecting the WebGL rendering.

5. **`src/ol/style/Icon.js`**: This file defines the `ol.style.Icon` class, which manages icon styles. It includes methods for handling icon properties like rotation and scaling, which could be relevant if the issue involves incorrect handling of icon-specific properties during rotation.
