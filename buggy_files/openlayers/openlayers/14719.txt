### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`
The wrong behavior described is that the WMS image appears blurry when the ratio is not a round integer or when the map width or height is not even. This issue is observed in the example at `https://sbrunner.github.io/ngeo/ol7b.html`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior
The blurriness likely stems from how the WMS image is being rendered or scaled. When the ratio is not a round integer or the dimensions are not even, the image may not be rendered pixel-perfectly, leading to interpolation artifacts that cause blurriness. This could be due to improper handling of image scaling, resolution, or reprojection in the rendering pipeline.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause from `Repository Information`
Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/source/ImageWMS.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/transform.js
src/ol/math.js
src/ol/size.js
```

### Explanation:
- **`src/ol/source/ImageWMS.js`**: This file is directly responsible for handling WMS image sources. It includes methods for constructing WMS request URLs, fetching images, and managing image parameters. Issues with image scaling or resolution could originate here.
- **`src/ol/source/TileImage.js`**: This file manages tile-based image sources, including tile loading, caching, and reprojection. It could be responsible for how tiles are rendered and scaled, which might affect image clarity.
- **`src/ol/transform.js`**: This file contains functions for applying transformations to coordinates and images. If the image is being improperly scaled or transformed, this file could be involved.
- **`src/ol/math.js`**: This file includes various mathematical functions used for calculations like scaling, rounding, and interpolation. Incorrect calculations here could lead to blurriness.
- **`src/ol/size.js`**: This file contains functions for handling sizes and dimensions, including scaling and buffering. If the image dimensions are not being handled correctly, this could contribute to the blurriness issue.
