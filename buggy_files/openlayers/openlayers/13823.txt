### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the image layer renderer is using more memory than necessary. Specifically, for image sources with a pixel ratio of 1, the renderer creates a canvas with the size for the display pixel ratio instead of the image ratio. This results in a canvas that is twice as big as it needs to be on HiDPI devices, consuming 4 times the memory.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is the incorrect scaling of the canvas size based on the display pixel ratio rather than the image source's pixel ratio. This likely happens during the canvas creation or resizing process, where the renderer assumes the display pixel ratio instead of the source's pixel ratio.

### Step 3: Find Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/source/ImageCanvas.js
src/ol/layer/BaseImage.js
src/ol/render/canvas.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js
src/ol/style/Icon.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **`src/ol/source/ImageCanvas.js`**: This file is directly involved in creating and managing the canvas for image sources. It likely contains the logic for determining the canvas size, which is where the issue originates.
2. **`src/ol/layer/BaseImage.js`**: This file manages server-rendered images and could be involved in setting up the image layer properties that influence canvas size.
3. **`src/ol/render/canvas.js`**: This file contains utility functions for canvas rendering, including setting up canvas dimensions and transformations. It might contain the logic that incorrectly scales the canvas.
4. **`src/ol/renderer/canvas/ImageLayer.js`**: This file handles the rendering of image layers on a canvas. It might be responsible for applying the incorrect pixel ratio during rendering.
5. **`src/ol/style/Icon.js`**: This file manages icon styles, which could be related if icons are being rendered with the incorrect pixel ratio. While less directly related, it could still be part of the rendering pipeline.
