### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the GeoTIFF source not utilizing the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values from the GeoTIFF metadata for normalization. Instead, it likely uses default values for `max` and `min`, which may not accurately reflect the actual data range.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that the GeoTIFF source does not automatically extract and apply the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values from the GeoTIFF metadata when performing normalization. This results in the use of default values for `max` and `min`, which may not represent the true range of the data, leading to incorrect normalization.

```

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js`**: This file is directly responsible for handling GeoTIFF data sources. It includes functions for fetching images, extracting metadata, and calculating resolutions. It is the most relevant file as it should be modified to incorporate the `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values from the metadata.

2. **`examples/cog-colors.js`**: This file contains functions that generate color gradients and handle color value pairs for normalization. It is relevant because it deals with the color scaling and normalization process, which would benefit from using the actual `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM` values.

3. **`src/ol/format/Feature.js`**: This file contains abstract methods for reading and writing features and geometries. While it is not directly related to GeoTIFF metadata, it is part of the broader framework for handling geospatial data and could be involved in the normalization process.

4. **`src/ol/geom/flat/closest.js`**: This file contains functions for calculating the closest points and distances, which might be indirectly relevant if the normalization process involves spatial calculations.

5. **`src/ol/geom/flat/simplify.js`**: This file contains functions for simplifying geometries, which might be relevant if the normalization process involves simplifying the data based on the actual range provided by `STATISTICS_MAXIMUM` and `STATISTICS_MINIMUM`.
