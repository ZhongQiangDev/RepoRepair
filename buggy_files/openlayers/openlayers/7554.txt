### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is the slow performance of the draw interaction when using the `imagevector` layer in OpenLayers version 4.6.2 with `renderMode: 'image'`. The user notes that this performance issue is not present in version 4.4.2.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The performance degradation is likely due to changes in how `ol.source.ImageVector` handles rendering in version 4.6.2. Specifically, the deprecation of `ol.source.ImageVector` and the recommendation to use `ol.layer.Vector` with `renderMode: 'image'` suggests that the internal rendering logic may have been altered or optimized differently, leading to slower performance in the draw interaction.

src/ol/renderer/vector.js
src/ol/interaction.js
```

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/source/imagevector.js`**: This file contains the deprecated `ImageVector` source, which is central to the issue. Changes or deprecation in this class could directly impact performance.

2. **`src/ol/renderer/canvas/vectorlayer.js`**: This file handles the rendering of vector layers on a canvas. Since the recommendation is to use `ol.layer.Vector` with `renderMode: 'image'`, this renderer is likely involved in the new rendering process and could be a source of performance differences.

3. **`src/ol/renderer/canvas/imagelayer.js`**: This file manages the rendering of image layers on a canvas. It may be relevant if the transition from `ImageVector` to `Vector` with `renderMode: 'image'` involves changes in how image layers are handled.

4. **`src/ol/renderer/vector.js`**: This file contains general vector rendering logic. Any changes in the rendering pipeline for vector layers could affect performance, especially when transitioning between different rendering modes.

5. **`src/ol/interaction.js`**: This file manages map interactions, including drawing. If the draw interaction is experiencing performance issues, changes in interaction handling could be a contributing factor.
