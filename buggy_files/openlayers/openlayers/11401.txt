### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described involves two main issues:
- **Hit Detection Failure**: When the scale of an icon is negative and the rotation is 0, the hit detection does not work as expected. This means that clicking on the icon does not register a hit.
- **Icon Rendering Issue**: The icon does not render correctly at the edge of the map when the scale is negative. Instead of being partially visible, it disappears.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issues likely stem from how negative scales and rotations are handled in the rendering and hit detection logic. Specifically:
- **Hit Detection**: The hit detection mechanism may not account for negative scales correctly, leading to incorrect calculations of the hit area.
- **Rendering**: The rendering logic might not handle negative scales properly, causing the icon to be clipped or not rendered at all when it should be partially visible at the map edge.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issues:

```
examples/icon-scale.js
src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js
src/ol/geom/Point.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
examples/icon-negative.js
```

### Explanation:

- **`examples/icon-scale.js`**: This file contains functions that handle icon scaling and rotation, which are directly related to the described issues. It likely needs adjustments to handle negative scales correctly.
- **`src/ol/render/canvas/hitdetect.js`**: This file is responsible for hit detection in canvas rendering. It may need modifications to correctly handle negative scales when calculating hit areas.
- **`src/ol/geom/Point.js`**: This file manages point geometries, which are fundamental for icon placement and rendering. It might need changes to ensure correct handling of negative scales.
- **`src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js`**: This file handles immediate rendering of vector geometries, including points and icons. It may need adjustments to properly render icons with negative scales.
- **`examples/icon-negative.js`**: This file contains functions that manage icon rendering and style retrieval, which might need to be updated to handle negative scales correctly.
