### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves incorrect rendering of vector contexts in tile layers when the map view is rotated close to 90 and 270 degrees. Specifically, issues arise with stroke width, text scale, and the precision of geometry rendering. This inconsistency is observed when comparing the vector context rendering on a tile layer with that of a vector layer.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely stems from how transformations and rotations are applied to the vector context within tile layers. When the map is rotated, the coordinate system and transformations applied to the canvas context may not be correctly adjusted for tile layers, leading to discrepancies in stroke width, text scaling, and geometry precision. This issue might be related to how the vector context is initialized and managed for tile layers compared to vector layers.

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/render.js`**: This file contains core rendering functions, including `getVectorContext`, which creates the `CanvasImmediateRenderer` object for immediate mode rendering on a canvas. The issue might be related to how transformations and rotations are applied in this context.

2. **`src/ol/renderer/canvas/TileLayer.js`**: This file manages the rendering of tile layers on a canvas. It includes methods for preparing frames, drawing tiles, and handling transformations. The problem might be in how these transformations are applied during rotations.

3. **`src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorImageLayer.js`**: This file specializes in rendering vector image layers on a canvas. It integrates coordinate transformations and feature interaction, which might be relevant to the issue of inconsistent rendering during rotations.

4. **`src/ol/source/VectorTile.js`**: This file manages vector tile data, including tile creation, caching, and projection-specific tile grids. The issue might be related to how vector tiles are handled and rendered in different projections and rotations.

5. **`src/ol/style/Style.js`**: This file defines the `ol.style.Style` class, which is central to customizing the visual representation of geographic features. The issue might be related to how styles are applied and transformed during rotations.
