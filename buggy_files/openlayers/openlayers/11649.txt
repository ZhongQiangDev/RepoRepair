### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves OpenLayers producing broken projections when using proj4js definitions for geographic CRS (e.g., EPSG:4258). Specifically, the `units` property is undefined, and the `axisOrientation` is set to an incorrect default value ("enu" instead of "neu").

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to how OpenLayers registers and processes proj4js definitions. When proj4js definitions are registered with OpenLayers using `ol.proj.proj4.register`, the projection object created by OpenLayers does not correctly inherit all necessary properties from the proj4js definition. This results in missing or incorrect properties like `units` and `axisOrientation`.

src/ol/proj/transforms.js
```

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/proj/proj4.js`**: This file is crucial as it handles the integration of proj4js with OpenLayers. The `register` function in this file is responsible for synchronizing proj4js projections with OpenLayers, which is where the issue likely originates.

2. **`src/ol/proj/Projection.js`**: This file defines the `Projection` class, which represents a map projection in OpenLayers. The properties like `units` and `axisOrientation` are defined here, and any issues with these properties would be relevant.

3. **`src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js`**: This file configures the EPSG:4326 projection, which is a geographic CRS similar to EPSG:4258. Understanding how EPSG:4326 is handled might provide insights into the issue with EPSG:4258.

4. **`src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`**: This file configures the EPSG:3857 projection, which is a common projected CRS. Comparing how projected CRSs are handled might help identify differences in handling geographic CRSs.

5. **`src/ol/proj/transforms.js`**: This file manages coordinate transformations between projections. While the issue is primarily about projection properties, transformations might also be affected if the properties are incorrect.
