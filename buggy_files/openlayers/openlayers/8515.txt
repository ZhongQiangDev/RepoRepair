1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue described is that the `ol.select.Interaction` feature is always shown as the top layer, regardless of the `zIndex` settings. This means that when a feature is selected, the red dots (representing the 'hover' effect) appear below the selected feature, even though they should be on top.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the `ol.select.Interaction` manages the rendering order of selected features. The `zIndex` property might not be respected due to how the selected features are rendered or due to the layering logic within the `ol.select.Interaction` class. This could be related to how the renderer handles the drawing order of features within the same layer or across different layers.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/ol/interaction/Select.js
src/ol/renderer/vector.js
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
src/ol/interaction.js
```

- `src/ol/interaction/Select.js`: This file contains the `Select` class, which manages the selection of features. It likely contains the logic that determines how selected features are rendered and their layering order.
- `src/ol/renderer/vector.js`: This file contains the rendering logic for vector layers. It might contain the code that handles the drawing order of features, including selected features.
- `src/ol/layer/Base.js`: This file defines the base layer class, which includes properties like `zIndex`. Issues with layer ordering might be related to how these properties are managed.
- `src/ol/layer/Layer.js`: This file contains the `Layer` class, which manages the visual representation of map data. It might contain logic related to layer ordering and rendering.
- `src/ol/interaction.js`: This file contains utility functions for interactions, including the default interactions setup. It might contain relevant configuration or initialization code that affects layer ordering.
