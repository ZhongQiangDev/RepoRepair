1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that when using `ol.render.toContext()` with a specified `pixelRatio` for Canvas Immediate rendering, the `lineDash` values are not scaled appropriately. This results in dashed lines appearing differently on devices with different pixel ratios, often causing the dashes and gaps to become much shorter relative to the line width, especially on high-resolution displays.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the `lineDash` values not being adjusted by the `pixelRatio` when rendering with `CanvasImmediateRenderer`. The `lineDash` array values should be scaled by the `pixelRatio` to maintain the intended visual appearance across different device pixel densities. This scaling is necessary because the `lineDash` values are in CSS pixels, and without scaling, they do not account for the higher physical pixel density on high-resolution displays.

```
src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js
src/ol/render.js
src/ol/render/canvas/LineStringBuilder.js
src/ol/style/Stroke.js
src/ol/renderer/vector.js
```

- `src/ol/render/canvas/Immediate.js`: This file contains the `CanvasImmediateRenderer` class, which is responsible for immediate rendering of vector data directly to an HTML5 Canvas. It likely needs to adjust the `lineDash` values based on the `pixelRatio` during rendering.
- `src/ol/render.js`: This file includes the `toContext` function, which sets up the canvas context for rendering with the specified `pixelRatio`. It may need to ensure that the `lineDash` values are scaled appropriately.
- `src/ol/render/canvas/LineStringBuilder.js`: This file contains the `CanvasLineStringBuilder` class, which handles the rendering of line strings. It may need to apply the `pixelRatio` scaling to the `lineDash` values when drawing lines.
- `src/ol/style/Stroke.js`: This file defines the `Stroke` style, which includes the `lineDash` property. It may need to provide a mechanism for scaling the `lineDash` values based on the `pixelRatio`.
- `src/ol/renderer/vector.js`: This file contains functions for rendering various geometries, including lines. It may need to ensure that the `lineDash` values are scaled correctly during the rendering process.
