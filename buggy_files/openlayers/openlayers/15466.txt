### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when the `declutterMode` is set to something other than `'declutter'`, the image and label combinations are not rendered correctly. Specifically, the issue is that the labels and images are not decluttered independently, leading to overlapping or incorrect rendering.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the way decluttering is handled in the rendering process. When `declutterMode` is set to a value other than `'declutter'`, the rendering logic may not properly separate the decluttering of images and labels. This could be due to a lack of support for independent decluttering modes for images and labels, or an issue with how the decluttering logic is applied to different types of features.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
src/ol/style/Image.js
src/ol/style/Text.js
src/ol/render/canvas/BuilderGroup.js
```

- `src/ol/layer/Vector.js`: This file manages the vector layer's decluttering behavior and rendering order, which is crucial for ensuring that images and labels are rendered correctly.
- `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js`: This file handles the actual rendering of features, including the decluttering process. It is likely where the issue with independent decluttering of images and labels is handled.
- `src/ol/style/Image.js`: This file defines the image style for vector features, which is relevant for ensuring that images are rendered correctly in the decluttering process.
- `src/ol/style/Text.js`: This file defines the text style for vector features, which is relevant for ensuring that labels are rendered correctly in the decluttering process.
- `src/ol/render/canvas/BuilderGroup.js`: This file manages the rendering instructions for different types of features, including images and labels, and may be involved in the decluttering process.
