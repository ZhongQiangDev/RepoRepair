1. **Wrong Behavior Involved:**
   The wrong behavior involves the extent of the COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) layer not being displayed correctly in the OpenLayers map. The image appears to be rendered with an incorrect extent, leading to a mismatch between the visual representation and the expected spatial coverage. Additionally, the extent seems to narrow when zooming in, indicating a potential issue with how the extent is being calculated or applied.

2. **Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how the extent of the COG layer is being handled during the rendering process. The extent values might not be correctly interpreted or applied, leading to an incorrect visual representation. This could be due to improper extent calculation, incorrect projection handling, or issues with the COG source configuration.

### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described involves a WebGLTile layer rendering images outside the original extent of the data. Specifically:
- The rendered image extends beyond the intended boundaries, as indicated by the red box in the images.
- The extent of the rendered image does not match the extent of the source data.
- When zooming in, the rendered image appears to narrow, indicating a potential issue with how the extent is being calculated or applied.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from one or more of the following issues:
- Incorrect extent calculation or application in the WebGLTile layer.
- Misalignment between the source data extent and the rendered extent.
- Potential issues with the tile grid configuration or tile size calculations.
- Incorrect handling of the source data's projection or coordinate system.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/source/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
```

#### Explanation:
- **`src/ol/source/WebGLTile.js`**: This file is directly responsible for managing the WebGLTile source, including how it handles the extent and rendering of tiles. It is the most likely place where the issue originates.
- **`src/ol/source/Tile.js`**: This file provides the base functionality for tile-based sources, including extent calculations and tile grid management. Issues here could propagate to the WebGLTile source.
- **`src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js`**: This file manages the tile grid configuration, which is crucial for determining the extent and placement of tiles. Incorrect tile grid settings could lead to rendering issues.
- **`src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`**: This file defines the WebGLTile layer, which is responsible for rendering the tiles on the map. Issues in the layer's rendering logic could cause the observed behavior.
- **`src/ol/layer/Layer.js`**: This file provides the base functionality for layers, including extent handling and rendering. While less likely, issues here could still affect the WebGLTile layer.
