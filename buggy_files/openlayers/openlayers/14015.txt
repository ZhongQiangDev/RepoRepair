### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that WebGL tile layers continue to use incorrect cached textures after the source is replaced using `setSource()` or when the view projection is changed. This results in tiles from the old source or projection being displayed when the map is panned or zoomed back to previous areas.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the caching mechanism not properly invalidating or clearing the old cached textures when the source is changed or the projection is updated. The WebGL tile layer's cache management does not recognize that the source or projection change invalidates the existing cached textures, leading to the display of outdated tiles.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue, ordered by importance:

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/source/Source.js
src/ol/layer/Layer.js
```

### Explanation:

- **`src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`**: This file contains the `WebGLTileLayer` class, which is responsible for managing WebGL tile layers. It likely needs to be updated to handle cache invalidation when the source or projection changes.

- **`src/ol/source/TileImage.js`**: This file manages tile image sources and includes methods for tile caching and reprojection. It may need modifications to ensure that the cache is properly cleared when the source or projection is updated.

- **`src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js`**: This file contains the WebGL renderer for tile layers. It may need adjustments to ensure that the renderer correctly handles changes in the source or projection and updates the cache accordingly.

- **`src/ol/source/Source.js`**: This file defines the base class for layer sources and includes methods for managing source states and refreshing data. It may need changes to ensure that the source state is correctly updated and triggers cache invalidation when necessary.

- **`src/ol/layer/Layer.js`**: This file contains the base class for layers and includes methods for setting and managing the layer's source. It may need modifications to ensure that the layer correctly handles source changes and triggers cache invalidation.
