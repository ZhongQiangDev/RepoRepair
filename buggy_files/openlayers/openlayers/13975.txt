### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the Y position of icons changes when their scale is modified, even though the user expects the bottom of the icons to remain at the same Y position. This suggests that the `displacement` property is not behaving as expected when combined with the `scale` property.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `displacement` and `scale` properties interact within the `ol.style.Icon` class. When scaling an icon, the displacement should ideally adjust to maintain the icon's bottom position. However, if the displacement is not recalculated or applied correctly during scaling, the icon's position will shift.

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/style/Icon.js`**: This file defines the `Icon` class, which is responsible for managing icon styles. The issue likely involves how the `scale` and `displacement` properties are handled within this class.

2. **`src/ol/style/IconImage.js`**: This file manages the actual image representation of the icon. The scaling and positioning of the image might be affected by how the `IconImage` class processes the `scale` and `displacement` properties.

3. **`examples/icon-scale.js`**: This example demonstrates how icon scaling and displacement are used in practice. It might provide insights into how these properties should interact and could help identify discrepancies between expected and actual behavior.

4. **`src/ol/style/Image.js`**: This abstract base class for image-based styles includes properties like `scale` and `displacement`. The issue might be related to how these properties are inherited and implemented in the `Icon` class.

5. **`src/ol/style/flat.js`**: This file contains utility functions for converting flat style objects into structured styles. If the issue involves how `scale` and `displacement` are processed during style conversion, this file might be relevant.
