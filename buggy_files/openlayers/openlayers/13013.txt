Based on the provided GitHub problem description and repository information, here's the analysis:

### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`
The wrong behavior appears to be related to the black screen issue when trying to display a slide. The console output shows that the `extent_` and `tmpExtent_` properties have negative values for the second coordinate, which is unusual for a valid extent. This suggests that the extent calculation or the coordinate system might be incorrect, leading to the black screen.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior
The cause of the black screen is likely due to incorrect extent values being used for rendering the slide. The negative values in the extent array (`extent_: Array(4) [ 0, -23828, 23903, ... ]`) indicate that the coordinate system might be inverted or incorrectly configured. This could be due to:
- Incorrect projection or coordinate transformation.
- Misconfigured tile grid or extent calculation.
- Issues with the source data or its metadata.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/layer/Tile.js
src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js
src/ol/geom/flat/extent.js
src/ol/geom/flat/transform.js
src/ol/geom/flat/coordinates.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **`src/ol/layer/Tile.js`**: This file is crucial for managing tile layers, which are likely involved in rendering the slide. It handles tile rendering and transformations, which could be related to the extent issue.
2. **`src/ol/layer/VectorTile.js`**: This file manages vector tile layers, which might be relevant if the slide involves vector data. It ensures proper rendering and coordinate transformations.
3. **`src/ol/geom/flat/extent.js`**: This file contains functions for handling extent calculations, which are directly related to the issue observed in the console output.
4. **`src/ol/geom/flat/transform.js`**: This file handles coordinate transformations, which could be causing the incorrect extent values if the transformation logic is flawed.
5. **`src/ol/geom/flat/coordinates.js`**: This file manages coordinate arrays, which are essential for defining the extent and rendering the slide correctly. Issues in coordinate handling could lead to the observed problem.
### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the `ol.layer.WebGLTile` layer does not render data loaded with `ol.source.DataTile` using a custom tile grid. The issue is indicated by black tiles and a WebGL warning message stating that the upload requires more data than is available.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to the mismatch between the tile sizes and the data being uploaded to the WebGL texture. The warning message suggests that the texture dimensions expected by WebGL do not match the actual data dimensions being provided. This could be due to incorrect tile size calculations or improper handling of the custom tile grid configuration.
