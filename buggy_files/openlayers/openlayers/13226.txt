### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that sources which use view projection with `wrapX` set to `false` do not work correctly with the `WebGLTileLayer`. Specifically, the WebGL renderer incorrectly expects the source to have a tile grid, leading to rendering issues when `wrapX` is `false`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the WebGLTileLayer's assumption that the source has a tile grid, which is not always the case when `wrapX` is `false`. This assumption may cause the WebGL renderer to fail to properly handle the source's tiles, leading to incorrect rendering. The problem could be related to how the WebGLTileLayer handles tile grids and projections, particularly when `wrapX` is disabled.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
```

### Explanation:

- **`src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`**: This file defines the `WebGLTileLayer` class, which is directly involved in the issue. It likely contains the logic that incorrectly assumes the source has a tile grid when `wrapX` is `false`.

- **`src/ol/source/Tile.js`**: This file contains the base class for tile-based image sources, which manages tile projections, caching, and grid structures. It may need adjustments to handle sources with `wrapX` set to `false`.

- **`src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js`**: This file defines the WebGL renderer for tile layers. It may need modifications to correctly handle tile sources without a tile grid when `wrapX` is `false`.

- **`src/ol/reproj/Tile.js`**: This file handles tile reprojection, which could be affected by the `wrapX` setting. Adjustments here might be necessary to ensure correct rendering.

- **`src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`**: This file contains projection-related functions, including transformations between different coordinate systems. It may need to be considered if the issue involves projection handling when `wrapX` is `false`.
