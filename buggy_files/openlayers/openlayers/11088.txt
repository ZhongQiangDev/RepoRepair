### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect rotation of the WMTS layer (EPSG:2180) when using proj4js version 2.6.1 with OpenLayers 6.3.2-dev.1589843798021. Specifically:
- When the view projection is set to Mercator (EPSG:3857), the WMTS layer appears rotated.
- When the view projection is set to EPSG:2180, the OSM layer (Mercator) appears rotated.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from changes in proj4js version 2.6.1, particularly the "Fixed interpretation of axis order." This change may have altered how proj4js handles coordinate transformations between projections, leading to incorrect axis alignment when integrating with OpenLayers. The problem seems to be related to how projections are defined, registered, or transformed within OpenLayers when using the updated proj4js.

```

**Explanation:**

- `src/ol/proj/proj4.js`: This file manages the integration of proj4js with OpenLayers. It is crucial for understanding how proj4js definitions are registered and used within OpenLayers. The issue may be related to how proj4js transformations are registered or applied.

- `src/ol/proj/Projection.js`: This file defines the `ol.proj.Projection` class, which encapsulates the properties and behaviors of map projections. It is essential for configuring and querying projection details, such as extents, units, and tile grids. The problem may involve incorrect configuration or handling of projection properties.

- `src/ol/proj/transforms.js`: This file manages coordinate transformation functions between different projections. It provides functionalities to add, remove, retrieve, and clear transformations. The issue may be related to incorrect or missing transformation functions between EPSG:3857 and EPSG:2180.

- `src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`: This file provides utilities for coordinate transformations between EPSG:4326 (WGS84) and EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator). Since the problem involves the Mercator projection, this file may be relevant for understanding how transformations to and from Mercator are handled.

- `src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js`: This file defines a custom projection class for the WGS84 coordinate system (EPSG:4326). It is important for understanding how geographic coordinates are handled within OpenLayers, which may be related to the issue when integrating with proj4js.
