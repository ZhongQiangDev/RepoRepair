1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the current implementation does not support an `auto` option for the `convertToRGB` setting when dealing with GeoTIFF sources. Specifically, if a GeoTIFF source has 3 samples per pixel and a photometric interpretation like CMYK, YCbCr, CIELab, or ICCLab, the `auto` setting should automatically use the `image.readRGB()` method to convert the data.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of logic in the GeoTIFF source handling that checks for the `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option and applies the appropriate conversion method (`image.readRGB()`) based on the photometric interpretation and samples per pixel. This requires modifications to the GeoTIFF source handling logic to recognize and process the `auto` setting correctly.

- `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js`: This file contains the core logic for handling GeoTIFF sources, including fetching images and processing raster data. It is the most relevant file as it needs to be updated to support the `convertToRGB: 'auto'` option.
- `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js`: This file manages the rendering of tile layers using WebGL. It may need updates to handle the new conversion logic when rendering GeoTIFF tiles.
- `examples/cog-blob.js`: This file demonstrates how GeoTIFF data is processed and visualized. It may need adjustments to showcase the new `auto` conversion feature.
- `src/ol/renderer/vector.js`: This file contains rendering functions for various geometry types. It might need to be updated if the new conversion affects vector rendering.
- `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js`: This file manages texture data for tiles in a WebGL environment. It may need modifications to handle the new RGB conversion logic when uploading texture data.
