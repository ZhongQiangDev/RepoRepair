### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that after updating to OpenLayers version 6.9.0, the opacity of independent layers (specifically tiled ArcGIS REST layers) is not stacking correctly. When multiple layers have the same opacity value (e.g., 0.5), the top-most layer appears fully opaque instead of semi-transparent as expected. This behavior is different from previous versions (e.g., 6.7.0), where the layers would display correctly with the specified opacity.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how OpenLayers handles the opacity of layers during rendering. Specifically, the problem may be related to how the canvas rendering context applies opacity to overlapping layers. In version 6.9.0, there might be a change in the way opacity is applied or composited, leading to the top layer appearing fully opaque instead of semi-transparent.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/Layer.js
src/ol/style/Fill.js
src/ol/style/Stroke.js
src/ol/layer/Group.js
```

- `src/ol/layer/Base.js`: This file contains the base layer class, which manages layer properties such as opacity. The issue might be related to how opacity is set and managed at the layer level.
- `src/ol/renderer/canvas/Layer.js`: This file handles the canvas rendering of layers. The problem could be in how the renderer applies opacity to the canvas context during rendering.
- `src/ol/style/Fill.js`: This file manages fill styles for vector features, which could be relevant if the issue involves the rendering of filled areas with opacity.
- `src/ol/style/Stroke.js`: This file manages stroke styles, which could be relevant if the issue involves the rendering of outlines with opacity.
- `src/ol/layer/Group.js`: This file manages layer groups, which could be relevant if the issue involves the stacking and rendering of multiple layers within a group.
