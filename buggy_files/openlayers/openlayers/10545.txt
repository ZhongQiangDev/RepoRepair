### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the label "Andy's Pub, Terrasse" is displayed as "Andy&amp;apos;s Pub, Terrasse" on the map. This indicates that the HTML entity `&amp;apos;` is not being properly decoded to the corresponding character `'` (apostrophe).

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the fact that the label text is being encoded as an HTML entity (`&amp;apos;`) but is not being decoded back to its original character form before being rendered on the map. This could happen at various stages:

- When the label text is read from the data source (e.g., KML file).
- When the label text is processed and stored in the application.
- When the label text is rendered on the map.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/format/KML.js
src/ol/style/Text.js
src/ol/render/canvas.js
src/ol/geom/flat/textpath.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js
```

- `src/ol/format/KML.js`: This file is responsible for parsing KML data, which is likely the source of the label text. If the text is not properly decoded during parsing, this could be the root cause.
- `src/ol/style/Text.js`: This file handles the styling of text labels on the map. If the text is not being decoded before being styled, this could be a contributing factor.
- `src/ol/render/canvas.js`: This file contains functions for rendering text on the canvas. If the text is not being decoded before rendering, this could also be a contributing factor.
- `src/ol/geom/flat/textpath.js`: This file handles text rendering along paths. If the text is not being decoded before being rendered along a path, this could be relevant.
- `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js`: This file manages the rendering of vector layers, including text labels. If the text is not being decoded before being rendered as part of a vector layer, this could be relevant.
