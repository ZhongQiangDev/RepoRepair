### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an icon's scale is set as a number and the icon is cloned, the cloned icon ends up with an array as its scale value instead of the original number. This results in an incorrect scale value for the cloned icon.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `setScale` method is implemented in the `Icon` class. When an icon is cloned, the constructor of the new icon is called, and if the scale is set as an array instead of a number, it suggests that the `setScale` method might be converting the scale value into an array format. This conversion happens during the cloning process, leading to the incorrect scale value in the cloned icon.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/style/Icon.js
src/ol/style/IconImage.js
src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js
examples/icon-scale.js
src/ol/style/flat.js
```

- `src/ol/style/Icon.js`: This file contains the `Icon` class, which is responsible for managing icon styles. The `setScale` method and the cloning process are likely defined here.
- `src/ol/style/IconImage.js`: This file manages the image properties of icons, which might be involved in the scale conversion process.
- `src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js`: This file handles caching of icon images, which could be relevant if the scale value is being cached and then incorrectly applied during cloning.
- `examples/icon-scale.js`: This example file demonstrates how the scale of an icon can be dynamically updated, which might provide insights into the expected behavior.
- `src/ol/style/flat.js`: This file contains utility functions for processing flat style objects, which might be involved in the conversion of scale values.
