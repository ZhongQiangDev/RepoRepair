### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the `wrapX` option in GeoTIFF sources is not respected when the tiles are reprojected. Specifically, the tiles are not being cropped to the tile grid extent as expected when reprojected, leading to incorrect visualizations.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `wrapX` option is handled during reprojection. The `wrapX` option in GeoTIFF sources is intended to crop the output to the tile grid extent on both the x and y axes, but this behavior is not being correctly applied when the tiles are reprojected. This could be due to a mismatch in how the `wrapX` option is interpreted or applied in the reprojection process.

### 3. Find Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue, ordered by importance:

```
src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/tilegrid.js
src/ol/reproj.js
examples/cog-blob.js
```

- `src/ol/reproj/DataTile.js`: This file contains the `ReprojDataTile` class, which manages the reprojection of tile data. It is likely where the `wrapX` option is applied during reprojection, and where the issue might be occurring.
- `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js`: This file contains the `GeoTIFFSource` class, which handles GeoTIFF data. It is responsible for setting up the `wrapX` option and ensuring it is respected during tile loading and rendering.
- `src/ol/tilegrid.js`: This file contains functions for creating and managing tile grids, including the `wrapX` functionality. It is crucial for defining the tile grid extent and ensuring tiles are cropped correctly.
- `src/ol/reproj.js`: This file contains functions for handling reprojection, including the `reproject_` method. It is involved in the actual reprojection process and may need to be adjusted to correctly handle the `wrapX` option.
- `examples/cog-blob.js`: This file contains an example of GeoTIFF visualization, which can be used to test and verify the fix. It may also need adjustments if the issue affects the example's behavior.
