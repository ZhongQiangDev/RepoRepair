### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the extent of the `VectorSource` is incorrect when accessed in the `featuresloadend` callback function. Specifically, it returns `[Infinity, Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity]`, which indicates that the extent is not being calculated correctly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the order of operations in the `loadFeaturesXhr` function. The image shows that the `success` callback is called before the features are added to the source (`source.addFeatures(features)`). This means that when the `featuresloadend` event is triggered, the features have not yet been added to the source, leading to an incorrect extent calculation.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause of the issue are:

```
src/ol/featureloader.js
src/ol/source/Vector.js
src/ol/extent.js
src/ol/geom/SimpleGeometry.js
src/ol/Feature.js
```

- **src/ol/featureloader.js**: This file contains the `xhr` function where the issue is identified. The order of `success` callback and `addFeatures` needs to be corrected.
- **src/ol/source/Vector.js**: This file manages the vector source and its features, including the extent calculation.
- **src/ol/extent.js**: This file contains utility functions for working with extents, which are relevant for calculating the extent of the vector source.
- **src/ol/geom/SimpleGeometry.js**: This file is related to the geometry of features, which can affect the extent calculation.
- **src/ol/Feature.js**: This file defines the feature class, which is used to store and manage individual features in the vector source.
