### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that when loading a COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF), only the upper part of the image is displayed, while the expected behavior is for the entire image to be shown, as seen in other viewers like geotiff.io or QGIS.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The problem likely stems from how the COG is being interpreted or rendered in the OpenLayers example. Possible causes include:
- Incorrect handling of non-square pixels in the COG.
- Misalignment of the image extent or projection.
- Issues with the tiling or reprojection logic when rendering the COG.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
src/ol/layer/Tile.js
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
src/ol/geom/Polygon.js
```

### Explanation:

- **`src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js`**: This file handles the loading and configuration of GeoTIFF images. It is crucial for ensuring that the COG is correctly interpreted and loaded, including handling non-square pixels and image extents.

- **`src/ol/reproj/Image.js`**: This file manages the reprojection of images. If there is an issue with the reprojection logic, it could lead to parts of the image not being displayed correctly.

- **`src/ol/layer/Tile.js`**: This file is responsible for rendering tile layers. If there is a problem with how tiles are rendered or managed, it could affect the display of the COG.

- **`src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`**: This file deals with the Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857). If there is a mismatch in the projection handling, it could cause parts of the image to be cut off.

- **`src/ol/geom/Polygon.js`**: This file handles polygon geometries. While less directly related, it could be relevant if the COG's extent is represented as a polygon and there are issues with how that extent is handled.
