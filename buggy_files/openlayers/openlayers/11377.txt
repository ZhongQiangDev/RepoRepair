### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is the performance degradation of the `pointermove` event in version 6.4.0 compared to version 6.3.1. Specifically, the cursor change during map interactions is much slower in 6.4.0, affecting operations like zooming and panning.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The performance issue likely stems from changes in how the `pointermove` event is handled or how feature detection and cursor style updates are processed in version 6.4.0. Possible causes include:

- **Event Handling Overhead**: The `pointermove` event might be triggering additional or more complex operations in 6.4.0, leading to slower performance.
- **Feature Detection**: The method used to detect features under the cursor might have changed, introducing additional computations.
- **Cursor Style Updates**: The process of updating the cursor style based on detected features could be less efficient in the newer version.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the performance issue:

```
src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js
src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js
src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js
src/ol/Map.js
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/ol/MapBrowserEventHandler.js`**: This file manages pointer events, including `pointermove`, and is crucial for handling cursor changes and feature detection during map interactions.
- **`src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js`**: This file handles drag and pan interactions, which are affected by the performance issue. It may contain logic related to cursor style updates during dragging.
- **`src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js`**: This file provides base functionality for pointer interactions, including event handling and feature detection, which could be impacting performance.
- **`src/ol/Map.js`**: This file manages the overall map rendering and event handling. Changes in how the map processes events could contribute to the performance degradation.
- **`src/ol/layer/Vector.js`**: This file handles vector layers, which are involved in feature detection and rendering. Changes in how vector layers are processed could affect the performance of cursor updates.
