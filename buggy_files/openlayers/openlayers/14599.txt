To address the issue described in the GitHub problem, let's break down the steps as requested:

### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`
The wrong behavior appears to be related to the visibility of the "SEZON OFF/ON" toggle (1) not affecting the visibility of the "budynki sezon" layer (2). The toggle seems to be intended to control the visibility of the "budynki sezon" layer, but it is not functioning as expected. Additionally, the "SEZON: Budynki" label (3) indicates that the layer should be visible when the toggle is on.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior
The cause of this issue likely lies in the configuration or event handling of the "SEZON OFF/ON" toggle. The toggle might not be correctly linked to the visibility of the "budynki sezon" layer, or there could be an issue with the layer's visibility settings. It's possible that the toggle's state is not being properly propagated to the layer's visibility, or the layer's visibility is not being updated when the toggle's state changes.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the provided repository information, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/layer/Group.js
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
src/ol/interaction/Select.js
src/ol/layer/Tile.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **`src/ol/layer/Base.js`**: This file defines the base class for layers, which includes properties like visibility. The issue might be related to how the visibility property is managed or updated.
2. **`src/ol/layer/Group.js`**: This file manages groups of layers, which could be relevant if the "budynki sezon" layer is part of a layer group.
3. **`src/ol/layer/Vector.js`**: This file is responsible for rendering vector features, which could be relevant if the "budynki sezon" layer is a vector layer.
4. **`src/ol/interaction/Select.js`**: This file handles selection interactions, which might be relevant if the toggle is part of an interaction that controls layer visibility.
5. **`src/ol/layer/Tile.js`**: This file manages tile layers, which could be relevant if the "budynki sezon" layer is a tile layer.

These files are likely to contain the logic and properties that control layer visibility and interactions, making them the most relevant for diagnosing and fixing the issue.
### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the attributions from a visible layer (sub-layer) within an invisible group layer are still being displayed in the info popup. Specifically, even though the group layer "SEZON OFF/ON" (1) is set to be invisible, the sub-layer "budynki sezon" (2) is visible, and its attributions (3) are still appearing in the info popup.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the visibility of layers and their sub-layers is managed in relation to the display of attributions. When a group layer is set to be invisible, its sub-layers should ideally not contribute to the info popup content. However, if the sub-layer's visibility is independently controlled and its attributions are still being processed, this can lead to the described behavior.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to the cause of this issue are likely those that handle layer visibility, attribution management, and the rendering of info popups. Here are the top 5 files, ordered by importance:

```
src/ol/layer/Group.js
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/source/TileWMS.js
src/ol/style/Style.js
src/ol/Overlay.js
```

- `src/ol/layer/Group.js`: This file manages group layers and their visibility. It is crucial for ensuring that sub-layers within an invisible group layer are correctly handled.
- `src/ol/layer/Base.js`: This file contains the base functionality for layers, including visibility settings and rendering logic.
- `src/ol/source/TileWMS.js`: This file handles WMS sources, which are likely used for the layers in question. It manages the attribution settings and how they are applied.
- `src/ol/style/Style.js`: This file manages the styles applied to layers, including how attributions are displayed.
- `src/ol/Overlay.js`: This file handles the rendering of overlays, such as info popups, which display the attributions.
