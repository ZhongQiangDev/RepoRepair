### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `applyTransform` function producing an extent with `NaN` values when applied to an empty extent. This `NaN` extent causes issues when used with the `fit` method, leading to a `TypeError` due to the inability to read properties of `undefined`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is rooted in the `fromEPSG4326` function, which is part of the transformation process from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3857. When an empty extent (with `Infinity` values) is passed to this function, the `Math.tan` function produces `NaN` values due to the input being `Infinity`. This `NaN` value propagates through the transformation process, resulting in an invalid extent.

- **src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js**: This file contains the `fromEPSG4326` function, which is directly responsible for the `NaN` values when transforming an empty extent.
- **src/ol/extent.js**: This file contains the `applyTransform` function, which is used to transform the extent and is where the issue is first observed.
- **src/ol/proj.js**: This file manages projection transformations and is involved in the overall process of converting between coordinate systems.
- **src/ol/transform.js**: This file contains functions for applying transformations to coordinates, which may be relevant for ensuring the transformation process handles edge cases like empty extents correctly.
- **src/ol/geom/flat/transform.js**: This file contains functions for transforming flat coordinate arrays, which may be relevant for ensuring consistent behavior across different types of coordinate transformations.
