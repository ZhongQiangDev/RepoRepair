1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the labels on the graticule layer show irregular intervals (e.g., 3', 3'.01", 2'.59") while the grid lines appear regular. The user expects the labels to have consistent intervals, such as 3' or 3'0".

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The irregular intervals in the labels likely stem from how the coordinates are being formatted or rounded when generating the labels. The graticule lines themselves seem to be correctly spaced, but the labels are not being formatted consistently. This could be due to precision issues in the coordinate calculations or the formatting logic used to display the labels.

   ```

   - `src/ol/geom/flat/closest.js`: This file contains functions for calculating the closest point on a line or polygon segment, which might be relevant if the labels are being positioned based on the closest point calculations.
   - `src/ol/geom/flat/segments.js`: This file processes flat coordinates in segments, which could be involved in how the graticule lines are segmented and labeled.
   - `src/ol/geom/flat/length.js`: This file calculates lengths of line strings and linear rings, which might be relevant if the labels are being spaced based on calculated lengths.
   - `src/ol/geom/flat/straightchunk.js`: This file analyzes segments to ensure they meet certain angle constraints, which could affect how the graticule lines are divided and labeled.
   - `src/ol/geom/flat/topology.js`: This file checks if linestrings are closed, which might be relevant if the graticule lines are being treated as closed shapes for labeling purposes.
