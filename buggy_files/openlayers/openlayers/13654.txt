### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that a UTM COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) is not being displayed on an EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) or EPSG:4326 (WGS84) map. The COG layer is added to the map, but nothing appears, even though other layers like OSM are visible. The map fits to the COG extent correctly, indicating that the COG source is being recognized, but the actual image data is not being rendered.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a reprojection problem. The COG is in a UTM projection (EPSG:32636), while the map is in either EPSG:3857 or EPSG:4326. OpenLayers does not automatically reproject raster data like GeoTIFFs. The COG source needs explicit configuration to handle the reprojection from UTM to the map's projection.

```
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
```
This file is crucial as it defines the GeoTIFF source, which is responsible for loading and rendering GeoTIFF data. It needs to be configured to handle reprojection.

```
src/ol/proj/transforms.js
```
This file manages coordinate transformations between different projections. Ensuring proper transformation functions are registered and used is essential for reprojection.

```
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
```
This file defines the EPSG:3857 projection, which is commonly used for web maps. Proper configuration and handling of this projection are necessary for the map display.

```
src/ol/proj/epsg4326.js
```
This file defines the EPSG:4326 projection. If the map is set to this projection, ensuring it is correctly configured is important.

```
src/ol/source/TileImage.js
```
This file manages tile-based image sources. While GeoTIFFs are not strictly tile-based, the principles of tile management and reprojection may still apply, especially if the COG is being treated as a tiled image source.
