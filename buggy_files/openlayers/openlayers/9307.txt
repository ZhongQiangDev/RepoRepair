1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that there is an unwanted gap between two lines of text in a label feature when using OpenLayers v4.6.4, which was not present in earlier versions like v2.13. The user wants to remove this gap to achieve a styling similar to the previous version.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The gap between the lines of text in the label is likely due to changes in the text rendering or styling logic in the newer version of OpenLayers. This could involve how the `ol.style.Text` class handles multi-line text, including line spacing or padding adjustments. The issue might be related to how the text is formatted or how the canvas rendering context is configured for text drawing.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause:**
   ```
   src/ol/style/Text.js
   src/ol/render/canvas.js
   src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
   src/ol/style/Icon.js
   src/ol/style/Image.js
   ```

   - `src/ol/style/Text.js`: This file is directly responsible for defining text styles and properties, including line spacing and padding, which could be causing the gap.
   - `src/ol/render/canvas.js`: This file contains functions for rendering text on the canvas, including text measurement and positioning, which might be affecting the text layout.
   - `src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js`: This class is specialized for rendering text on the canvas and could be involved in the specific formatting of multi-line text.
   - `src/ol/style/Icon.js`: Although primarily for icons, it might be relevant if icons are used in conjunction with text labels and could influence text styling.
   - `src/ol/style/Image.js`: This file manages image-based styles, which might be indirectly related if images are used in text labels and affect text layout.
