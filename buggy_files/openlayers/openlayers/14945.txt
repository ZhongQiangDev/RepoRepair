### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves a mismatch between the layer and the map when using the `ImageArcGISRest` source in OpenLayers 7.4. Specifically, the layer does not align correctly with the map when the `ratio` parameter is set to values other than 1 or 1.5, especially when the computer's zoom or scaling ratio is not 100%. Additionally, there is a layer-map mismatch after the map is rotated.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the default `ratio` parameter in the `ImageArcGISRest` source. The `ratio` parameter affects how the image is scaled and rendered. When the `ratio` is set to values other than 1 or 1.5, it can lead to incorrect scaling and alignment of the layer with the map. This is exacerbated when the computer's display scaling is not 100%, as the scaling factor is not properly accounted for in the rendering process. The layer-map mismatch after rotation suggests that the rotation transformation is not correctly applied when the `ratio` is not 1.

- `src/ol/source/ImageArcGISRest.js`: This file contains the core logic for the `ImageArcGISRest` source, including the `ratio` parameter handling and image fetching. It is the primary source of the issue.
- `src/ol/layer/BaseImage.js`: This file manages the rendering of server-rendered images, which includes the `ImageArcGISRest` layer. It may contain logic related to scaling and rendering that could be contributing to the problem.
- `src/ol/render/canvas.js`: This file contains functions for rendering on a canvas, including transformations and scaling. It may be involved in the incorrect scaling or rotation of the layer.
- `src/ol/transform.js`: This file provides functions for applying transformations, including scaling and rotation. It could be relevant to the layer-map mismatch after rotation.
- `examples/layer-clipping-vector.js`: This file contains an event listener for post-rendering that applies a clipping mask. While not directly related to the `ImageArcGISRest` source, it may provide additional context for rendering and transformations.
