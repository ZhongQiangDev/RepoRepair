### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that the `setOpacity` function of the image in a feature style does not affect the UI as expected after upgrading to version 6.2.0. Specifically, the feature does not blink as it did in version 6.1.1.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from a change in how the `setOpacity` function is handled for image styles in version 6.2.0. This could involve changes in the rendering pipeline, the way opacity is applied to images, or how the style function is processed. The problem might be related to how the opacity value is passed to the rendering context or how the image style is updated after the opacity change.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/style/Image.js
src/ol/style/Style.js
src/ol/render/canvas.js
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
src/ol/style/Icon.js
```

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/style/Image.js`**: This file contains the base class for image-based styles, including properties like opacity. Changes here could directly affect how opacity is applied to images.

2. **`src/ol/style/Style.js`**: This file manages the overall style of features, including image styles. It could contain logic that affects how opacity is set and applied.

3. **`src/ol/render/canvas.js`**: This file handles the rendering of styles on the canvas. If there are changes in how opacity is applied during rendering, this file would be relevant.

4. **`src/ol/layer/Vector.js`**: This file manages vector layers, which include the rendering of features with styles. It could contain logic that affects how opacity is handled during layer rendering.

5. **`src/ol/style/Icon.js`**: This file specifically handles icon styles, which are a type of image style. If there are changes in how icon opacity is managed, this file would be relevant.
