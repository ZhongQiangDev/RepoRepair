### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the graticule (grid lines) does not display correctly when the map projection crosses the dateline (180Â° longitude). Specifically:
- Most meridians (longitude lines) do not appear.
- Parallels (latitude lines) begin at the dateline and/or extend too far.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the graticule lines are generated and rendered when the map projection spans the dateline. The dateline introduces a discontinuity in longitude values, which can cause problems in determining the correct start and end points for the graticule lines. The rendering logic may not correctly handle the transition across the dateline, leading to missing or incorrectly drawn lines.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue, ordered by importance:

```
src/ol/layer/Graticule.js
src/ol/proj/Projection.js
src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js
src/ol/geom/flat/straightchunk.js
src/ol/geom/flat/area.js
```

- **`src/ol/layer/Graticule.js`**: This file contains the `Graticule` class responsible for rendering the graticule lines. It likely contains the logic for generating and rendering the meridians and parallels, which needs to be adjusted to handle the dateline correctly.
- **`src/ol/proj/Projection.js`**: This file defines the properties and behaviors of map projections. It may contain settings or methods that need to be adjusted to handle the dateline discontinuity.
- **`src/ol/proj/epsg3857.js`**: This file handles the Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857), which is commonly used in web maps. It may need adjustments to ensure correct handling of the dateline in this specific projection.
- **`src/ol/geom/flat/straightchunk.js`**: This file contains functions for analyzing line segments and ensuring they are continuous. It may be relevant for ensuring that graticule lines are correctly segmented across the dateline.
- **`src/ol/geom/flat/area.js`**: This file contains functions for calculating areas of linear rings and polygons. While not directly related to graticule rendering, it may be relevant for ensuring that the graticule lines correctly enclose the map area, especially near the dateline.
