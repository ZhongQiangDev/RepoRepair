### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`
The issue described is that after drawing a polygon using the `ol.interaction.Draw` interaction in OpenLayers 5.3.0, the map becomes unresponsive to dragging. This behavior is inconsistent and does not occur in OpenLayers 4.6.5.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior
The problem likely stems from a change in how the `ol.interaction.Draw` interaction handles events or interacts with other map interactions in OpenLayers 5.3.0. Specifically, the `drawend` event might be interfering with the `DragPan` interaction, preventing the map from being dragged.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause
Based on the analysis, the following files are most relevant to the issue:

```
src/ol/interaction/Draw.js
src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js
src/ol/interaction.js
examples/draw-features.js
examples/draw-and-modify-features.js
```

These files are directly involved in the drawing interaction, the dragging interaction, and the setup of interactions in the examples, which are likely where the issue manifests.
### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`
The issue described is that after drawing a polygon using the `ol.interaction.Draw` interaction in OpenLayers 5.3.0, the map becomes unresponsive to dragging. This behavior does not occur in OpenLayers 4.6.5, suggesting a regression in the newer version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior
The problem likely stems from how the `ol.interaction.Draw` interaction handles the `DRAWEND` event and subsequent pointer events. Specifically, it may be related to how the interaction manages the state of the map after a drawing operation is completed. The interaction might be incorrectly preventing the map from receiving pointer events intended for dragging.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause from `Repository Information`
Based on the analysis, the following files are most relevant to the issue, ordered by importance:

```
src/ol/interaction/Draw.js
src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js
src/ol/pointer/PointerEventHandler.js
src/ol/Map.js
src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js
```

- `src/ol/interaction/Draw.js`: This file contains the core logic for the drawing interaction, including event handling and state management. It is crucial for understanding how the drawing interaction behaves during and after a drawing operation.
- `src/ol/interaction/Pointer.js`: This file manages pointer events, which are essential for both drawing and dragging interactions. It may contain logic that affects how events are propagated after a drawing operation.
- `src/ol/pointer/PointerEventHandler.js`: This file handles the registration and dispatching of pointer events. It ensures that events are correctly routed to the appropriate handlers, which is critical for maintaining the map's responsiveness.
- `src/ol/Map.js`: This file contains the main map class, which manages all interactions and layers. It ensures that interactions are correctly added and removed, and that the map remains responsive to user input.
- `src/ol/interaction/DragPan.js`: This file contains the logic for the drag pan interaction, which is responsible for allowing users to drag the map. It may be affected by changes in the drawing interaction, leading to the observed issue.
