1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `className` setting in `ol.layer.HeatMap` does not work as expected. The custom `className` is not being applied, and the default `className` is not displayed on the page.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely lies in how the `HeatmapLayer` class handles the `className` property. It may not be properly propagating or applying the `className` to the underlying DOM elements, such as the canvas or div that represents the heatmap layer.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js
src/ol/layer/Base.js
src/ol/layer/Vector.js
src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js
src/ol/renderer/Layer.js
```

- `src/ol/layer/Heatmap.js`: This file defines the `Heatmap` layer and is directly responsible for handling the `className` property. It is the most relevant file to investigate the issue.
- `src/ol/layer/Base.js`: This file contains the base layer class that `Heatmap` extends. It may contain methods or properties related to setting and applying `className`.
- `src/ol/layer/Vector.js`: The `Heatmap` layer extends `Vector`, so this file might contain relevant logic for managing layer styles and properties.
- `src/ol/render/canvas/Executor.js`: This file handles the rendering of vector features on a canvas. It may be involved in applying styles and classes to the rendered elements.
- `src/ol/renderer/Layer.js`: This file contains the base renderer class for layers. It may have methods related to rendering and applying styles to layers.
