### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect placement and size of point symbols (stars) when displaying a KML layer in OpenLayers. Specifically:
- The symbols appear to be anchored at the center-bottom instead of the center.
- The symbols are displayed at a larger size compared to how they are shown in Google Earth.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the incorrect symbol placement and size likely stems from issues with the symbol's anchor point and scaling. In OpenLayers, the anchor point for symbols is defined in the `ol.style.Icon` configuration, and the size is controlled by the `scale` property. The KML format specifies these properties, but the OpenLayers KML parser (`ol.format.KML`) may not be correctly interpreting or applying them.

src/ol/format/KML.js
examples/drag-and-drop-custom-kmz.js
src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js
src/ol/style/Circle.js
```

**Explanation:**
- `src/ol/style/Icon.js`: This file defines the `ol.style.Icon` class, which is responsible for rendering icons on the map. The anchor point and scaling of the icons are configured here, so any issues with symbol placement and size would likely be related to this file.
- `src/ol/format/KML.js`: This file contains the KML parser, which reads KML data and converts it into OpenLayers features. If the parser is not correctly interpreting the KML symbol properties, it could lead to the observed issues.
- `examples/drag-and-drop-custom-kmz.js`: This example demonstrates how KML files are loaded and displayed on the map. It may contain specific configurations or styles that affect the rendering of KML symbols.
- `src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js`: This file manages the caching of icon images. While less directly related, issues with image caching could potentially affect the rendering of symbols.
- `src/ol/style/Circle.js`: This file defines the `ol.style.Circle` class, which is used for rendering circular symbols. Although the stars are not circles, the general symbol rendering logic may be relevant.
