1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when using an icon style with a custom color and an offset, the offset is incorrect when the screen pixel ratio is not 1. This results in the icon being misaligned relative to its intended position on the map.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the icon's offset is calculated and applied when the icon is rendered. The offset calculation may not be accounting for the pixel ratio correctly, leading to misalignment. Additionally, the custom color application might be affecting the dimensions or positioning of the icon, further contributing to the offset issue.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/ol/style/Icon.js
   src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js
   src/ol/render/canvas/ImageBuilder.js
   src/ol/source/TileImage.js
   src/ol/color.js
   ```

   - `src/ol/style/Icon.js`: This file is crucial as it defines the `Icon` style, including how offsets are applied and how the icon is rendered. The issue with incorrect offsets is likely related to how the icon's position is calculated in this file.
   - `src/ol/style/IconImageCache.js`: This file manages the caching of icon images, which could be relevant if the issue involves how the icon is loaded or resized based on the pixel ratio.
   - `src/ol/render/canvas/ImageBuilder.js`: This file handles the rendering of images on the canvas, including the application of styles and offsets. It may contain logic that needs to be adjusted to account for the pixel ratio.
   - `src/ol/source/TileImage.js`: This file manages tile images, which could be relevant if the issue involves how the icon is positioned relative to the tile grid.
   - `src/ol/color.js`: This file handles color manipulation, which might be relevant if the custom color application is affecting the icon's dimensions or positioning.
