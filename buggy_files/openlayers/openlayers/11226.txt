### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when editing a `GeometryCollection` containing multiple polygons, dragging a common vertex causes unexpected behavior. Instead of the polygons moving together as expected, they deform and separate in an unintended manner. This issue does not occur when the same geometries are aggregated in a `FeatureCollection`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `GeometryCollection` is handled during the modify interaction. When a common vertex is dragged, the modify interaction should update all geometries that share that vertex. However, in the case of a `GeometryCollection`, the interaction may not correctly identify and update all related geometries, leading to the observed deformation. This could be due to differences in how `GeometryCollection` and `FeatureCollection` manage and update shared vertices.

**Explanation:**

- `src/ol/interaction/Modify.js`: This file contains the core logic for modifying geometries. It is crucial for understanding and fixing the issue related to dragging vertices in a `GeometryCollection`.
- `src/ol/geom/GeometryCollection.js`: This file defines the `GeometryCollection` class, which is central to the problem. Understanding how it manages and updates its geometries is essential.
- `src/ol/geom/Feature.js`: This file defines the `Feature` class, which is used in `FeatureCollection`. Comparing its behavior with `GeometryCollection` may help identify the discrepancy.
- `examples/modify-test.js`: This example file demonstrates the modify interaction and may provide additional context or test cases for the issue.
- `src/ol/geom/flat/closest.js`: This file contains functions for calculating the closest point on a geometry, which may be relevant for determining the correct vertex to drag in a `GeometryCollection`.
