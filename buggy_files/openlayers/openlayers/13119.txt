1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the WebGLTile Layers in OpenLayers do not support a customizable blending function, specifically `gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE, gl.ONE)`, which is needed for a subset of Tile Layers. This limitation prevents the desired blending effect for certain layers.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the WebGLTile Layer implementation in OpenLayers does not provide an option to set a custom blending function. The blending function is hardcoded or set to a default value, and there is no mechanism to override it for individual layers. This lack of flexibility prevents users from achieving the desired blending effect.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js
src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js
src/ol/webgl/Helper.js
src/ol/webgl/ShaderBuilder.js
src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js
```

- `src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`: This file defines the WebGLTileLayer class, which is responsible for managing WebGL-based tile layers. It is the primary place where the blending function could be modified.
- `src/ol/renderer/webgl/TileLayer.js`: This file contains the WebGL renderer for tile layers, which handles the actual rendering process. It is where the blending function is likely applied during rendering.
- `src/ol/webgl/Helper.js`: This file contains helper functions for WebGL operations, which might include the default blending function setup. Modifying this could affect the default behavior.
- `src/ol/webgl/ShaderBuilder.js`: This file is responsible for building shaders, which are used in WebGL rendering. Custom blending functions might require changes in shader code.
- `src/ol/webgl/TileTexture.js`: This file manages WebGL textures for tiles, which are part of the rendering process. While less directly related, it might need adjustments if texture handling is affected by the blending function.
