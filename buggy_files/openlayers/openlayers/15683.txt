### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that the vector layer canvas is cropped when the map is rotated. Specifically, when the map is rotated using `shift+ALT+DRAG`, the vector layer canvas does not adjust correctly, leading to parts of the vector layer being cut off.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the vector layer canvas is rendered and resized when the map is rotated. The rotation transformation may not be correctly applied to the vector layer canvas, causing it to be cropped instead of being resized or repositioned to fit the new orientation. This could involve problems with the rendering context, the extent calculations, or the transformation matrix applied during rotation.

src/ol/render.js
src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js
src/ol/interaction/DragRotate.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `src/ol/rotationconstraint.js`: This file contains functions related to rotation constraints, which might be involved in how the map's rotation affects the vector layer canvas. Ensuring the rotation constraints are correctly applied is crucial for maintaining the canvas size and position during rotation.

- `src/ol/geom/Geometry.js`: This file contains the base class for vector geometries. The issue might be related to how the geometry's extent is calculated or transformed during rotation, which could affect the canvas size.

- `src/ol/render.js`: This file includes functions for rendering and managing canvas contexts. The issue might be related to how the rendering context is transformed or updated during map rotation.

- `src/ol/renderer/canvas/VectorLayer.js`: This file is responsible for rendering vector layers on a canvas. The issue might be related to how the vector layer is rendered and updated when the map is rotated.

- `src/ol/interaction/DragRotate.js`: This file contains the logic for the drag rotation interaction. The issue might be related to how the interaction handles the rotation of the map and updates the vector layer canvas accordingly.
