1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior involves the `setFill()` method in the `ol.style.Style` object causing an additional semi-transparent layer to appear on top of other layers when used with `ol.layer.VectorTile`. Additionally, using `setFill()` results in flickering on the web side when the mouse hovers over the map.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how `setFill()` is applied to the `ol.layer.VectorTile` layer. The additional semi-transparent layer suggests a problem with how the fill style is being applied or rendered. The flickering on hover indicates a potential issue with the rendering pipeline, possibly related to how the fill style is updated or how the layer is re-rendered during mouse events.
