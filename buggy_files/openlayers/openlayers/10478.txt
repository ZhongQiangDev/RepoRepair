### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves a white rectangle appearing on the map, which seems to be a visual artifact or unintended rendering. This rectangle does not appear to be part of the intended map features and may be caused by an issue with the reprojection or rendering of the map tiles.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The white rectangle likely results from a reprojection issue or an error in the rendering process. When the map is rendered, the reprojection of tiles from one coordinate system to another might not be handled correctly, leading to the appearance of this unintended shape. This could be due to incorrect coordinate transformations, improper handling of tile boundaries, or a bug in the reprojection logic.

### Explanation:

1. **`src/ol/proj/projections.js`**: This file manages the projection definitions and transformations. If there is an issue with the projection setup or the transformation between coordinate systems, it could lead to incorrect rendering of tiles, resulting in the white rectangle.

2. **`src/ol/proj/transforms.js`**: This file handles the actual transformation logic between different projections. If the transformation logic is incorrect or incomplete, it could cause tiles to be rendered incorrectly, leading to the white rectangle.

3. **`src/ol/layer/Tile.js`**: This file manages the rendering of tile layers. If there is an issue with how tiles are rendered or how the layer handles reprojection, it could result in the white rectangle appearing.

4. **`src/ol/source/Tile.js`**: This file manages the tile source, including fetching and caching tiles. If there is an issue with how tiles are fetched or cached, it could lead to incorrect rendering.

5. **`src/ol/layer/WebGLTile.js`**: This file manages the WebGL rendering of tile layers. If there is an issue with the WebGL rendering process, it could cause the white rectangle to appear. This is particularly relevant if the application is using WebGL for rendering.
1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that white areas appear on the map when zooming in and out with a reprojected Tile layer. This indicates that certain tiles are not being rendered correctly, leading to gaps in the map display.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem seems to stem from tiles being disposed of prematurely or not being fetched when needed. Specifically, the underlying `Tile` objects are being disposed of and excluded from the stitching process during reprojection, which results in missing tiles and white areas on the map.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/ol/reproj/Tile.js
src/ol/source/Tile.js
src/ol/structs/LRUCache.js
src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js
src/ol/source/UrlTile.js
```

- `src/ol/reproj/Tile.js`: This file is directly related to the reprojection process and likely contains the logic for handling tiles during reprojection. It is crucial for understanding and fixing the issue with missing tiles.
- `src/ol/source/Tile.js`: This file manages the tile source and is responsible for loading and caching tiles. It may contain the logic for disposing of tiles or determining when to refetch them.
- `src/ol/structs/LRUCache.js`: This file implements the LRU cache used for storing tiles. It might be involved in the disposal of tiles that are no longer considered recently used, leading to the issue.
- `src/ol/tilegrid/TileGrid.js`: This file manages the tile grid and is responsible for calculating tile coordinates and extents. It could be relevant if there are issues with how tiles are being requested or managed within the grid.
- `src/ol/source/UrlTile.js`: This file handles URL-based tile sources and may contain logic for fetching and managing tiles that could be contributing to the problem.
