### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`
The wrong behavior described is that the `textAlign` property of the `Text` style is not correctly applying the `'start'` and `'end'` values. Specifically, the text labels 'Small text' and 'negative offsetX' are aligned at the wrong end, indicating a regression in the text alignment functionality.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior
The issue likely stems from a problem in how the `textAlign` property is being interpreted or applied within the text rendering pipeline. This could involve incorrect handling of the `'start'` and `'end'` values in the text alignment logic, or a bug in the rendering process that affects the alignment of text labels.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause from `Repository Information`
Based on the problem description and the repository information, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/ol/style/Text.js
src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js
src/ol/style/flat.js
src/ol/render/canvas.js
examples/vector-labels-justify-text.js
```

- `src/ol/style/Text.js`: This file defines the `Text` style class, which is responsible for configuring text properties, including `textAlign`. Issues with the `textAlign` property could originate here.
- `src/ol/render/canvas/TextBuilder.js`: This file handles the rendering of text on the canvas. If the `textAlign` property is not being correctly applied during rendering, this file could be the source of the problem.
- `src/ol/style/flat.js`: This file contains functions for converting flat style objects into structured styles. If there's a problem with how `textAlign` is being processed or passed through this conversion, it could contribute to the issue.
- `src/ol/render/canvas.js`: This file contains general rendering utilities, including text measurement and drawing functions. If there's a bug in how text is being measured or drawn, it could affect alignment.
- `examples/vector-labels-justify-text.js`: This example file demonstrates text justification and alignment. While it may not directly cause the issue, it can provide context and test cases for verifying the fix.
