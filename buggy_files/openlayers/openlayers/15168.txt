### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`
The wrong behavior is that the raster reprojection in OpenLayers assumes that the target pixels are square, which leads to misalignment when the source pixels cover non-square areas in their original projection. Specifically, the horizontal alignment is incorrect when projecting a 5x5 pixel image with each pixel covering a 3km by 2km area from Lambert Conformal Conic to Web Mercator.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior
The cause of this issue is likely rooted in the reprojection logic within OpenLayers. The reprojection process assumes that the target pixels should be square, which is not always appropriate when the source pixels are not square in their original projection. This assumption leads to incorrect scaling and alignment of the pixels in the target projection.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause from `Repository Information`
The files most related to the cause of the issue are those that handle reprojection, coordinate transformations, and image handling. Here are the top 5 files, ordered by importance:

```
src/ol/reproj.js
src/ol/reproj/Image.js
src/ol/proj/projections.js
src/ol/proj/Projection.js
src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js
```

- `src/ol/reproj.js`: This file contains core functions for reprojection, including the `reprojection render function` and `source resolution calculation`, which are directly involved in the reprojection process.
- `src/ol/reproj/Image.js`: This class is responsible for reprojecting images between coordinate systems, which is directly related to the issue described.
- `src/ol/proj/projections.js`: This file manages the cache of projections, which is essential for reprojection operations.
- `src/ol/proj/Projection.js`: This class encapsulates the properties and behaviors of map projections, which are crucial for understanding and managing the reprojection process.
- `src/ol/source/GeoTIFF.js`: This file handles GeoTIFF data, which may be relevant if the issue involves GeoTIFF files. It includes methods for fetching and processing images, which could be related to the reprojection issue.
