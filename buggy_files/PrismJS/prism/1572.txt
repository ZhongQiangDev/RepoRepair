1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that G-code syntax highlighting is not currently supported in Prism.js. The request is to add support for G-code with the language identifier `gcode`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that Prism.js does not have a language definition for G-code. To fix this, a new language definition needs to be added to Prism.js that includes the necessary syntax rules for G-code.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-asciidoc.js
components/prism-bash.js
components/prism-latex.js
```

**Explanation:**
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including language management and tokenization. Adding a new language definition would involve modifying or extending this file.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles inlined languages within markup. While G-code is not a markup language, understanding how other languages are integrated might be useful.
- `components/prism-asciidoc.js`: This file shows how a new language definition is created and integrated into Prism.js. It can serve as a reference for creating the G-code definition.
- `components/prism-bash.js`: Another example of a language definition, useful for understanding how to define syntax rules for a specific language.
- `components/prism-latex.js`: Another language definition example, which can provide additional insights into structuring the new G-code language definition.
