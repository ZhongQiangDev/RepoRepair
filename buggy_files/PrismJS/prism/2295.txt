1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that single-package package names (e.g., `package baz;`) are not being highlighted correctly. Instead, they are being treated as regular text rather than as package declarations.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to how the `prism-java.js` file defines the regex patterns for package declarations. The current pattern might not be correctly identifying single-package names, leading to them being treated as plain text.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-java.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-css.js
```

- `components/prism-java.js`: This file is the primary language definition for Java in Prism.js. It contains the regex patterns and rules for highlighting Java syntax, including package declarations. This is the most important file to address the issue.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization and highlighting process. It may need to be checked to ensure that the Java language definition is being applied correctly.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin allows for more granular styling of keywords. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how keywords are being highlighted.
- `components/prism-js-extras.js`: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting and might have some rules that could interfere with Java syntax highlighting.
- `components/prism-css.js`: Although less directly related, this file handles CSS syntax highlighting, which might be relevant if there are any conflicts with CSS-like syntax in Java package declarations.
