1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that numeric literals with underscores as separators (numeric separators) are not being highlighted correctly by Prism.js. The underscores are not being recognized as valid parts of the numeric literals, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the existing grammar rules for numeric literals in Prism.js not accounting for the new JavaScript feature of numeric separators. The regular expressions used to match numeric literals do not include the underscore character as a valid separator within numbers.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-javascript.js
components/prism-markup.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
```

- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization and highlighting processes. It is crucial for understanding how tokens are processed and where the issue might be occurring.
- `components/prism-javascript.js`: This file defines the grammar rules for JavaScript, including numeric literals. The issue likely stems from the regex patterns used to match numeric literals, which need to be updated to include underscores as valid separators.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles inlined languages within markup, which might be relevant if the issue occurs in contexts where JavaScript is embedded in other languages.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin adds custom CSS classes to keyword tokens, which might be relevant if the issue involves how keywords are styled.
- `plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`: This plugin ensures that custom HTML markup remains intact during highlighting, which might be relevant if the issue involves how markup is preserved during the highlighting process.
