1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when a SQL string literal contains an `@` symbol (used for parameter placeholders in SQL), the opening quote is not recognized correctly, leading to improper syntax highlighting. This is evident in the first example where the string is not highlighted properly.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely related to how Prism.js handles string literals in VB.NET. Specifically, the regex pattern used to identify string literals may not be accounting for the `@` symbol within the string, causing the parser to misinterpret the string boundaries.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-vbnet.js
components/prism-sql.js
components/prism-string.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-regex.js
```

- `components/prism-vbnet.js`: This file contains the specific language definition for VB.NET, including the string pattern that needs to be adjusted to handle the `@` symbol correctly.
- `components/prism-sql.js`: This file defines SQL syntax highlighting rules, which may also need to be considered if the issue is related to SQL syntax within VB.NET.
- `components/prism-string.js`: This file likely contains general string handling rules that could be relevant to the issue.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the main tokenization logic, which might need to be reviewed if the issue is more fundamental.
- `components/prism-regex.js`: This file handles regular expressions, which are used to define the string patterns. It might be relevant if the issue is related to regex handling.
