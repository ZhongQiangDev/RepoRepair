1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that interpolation in Ruby regex literals (`/foo#{bar}/`) is not being highlighted correctly. However, interpolation in Ruby regex literals using `%r` notation (`%r[foo#{bar}]`) is highlighted correctly.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause likely lies in how Prism.js handles regex literals in Ruby. Specifically, the regex pattern used to match and highlight interpolation within `/.../` regex literals might be missing or incorrectly defined. In contrast, the `%r` notation is correctly handled, suggesting that the issue is specific to the `/.../` notation.

```

- **`components/prism-ruby.js`**: This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for Ruby, including regex literals and interpolation. It is the most relevant file as it directly handles Ruby-specific syntax.
- **`components/prism-regex.js`**: This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for regular expressions. It may contain patterns that need to be adjusted to correctly handle interpolation within Ruby regex literals.
- **`components/prism-core.js`**: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process. It might be relevant if there is a general issue with how Prism.js processes regex literals.
- **`components/prism-markup.js`**: This file handles embedded languages within markup. Although less directly related, it might be relevant if there are issues with how embedded Ruby code is handled.
- **`plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`**: This plugin allows for fine-grained styling of keywords. It might be relevant if there are issues with how specific keywords within regex literals are highlighted.
