### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the Apex language is not currently supported by Prism.js, and the user is seeking guidance on whether to add it as a new language definition or to alias it to the existing Java definition. The user is concerned about the overhead of creating a new language definition when Apex is very similar to Java.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause is that Prism.js does not have a dedicated language definition for Apex. Since Apex is similar to Java, the user is considering whether to create a new language definition or to alias Apex to Java. The concern is that aliasing might not fully capture the nuances of Apex, while creating a new definition might be unnecessary overhead if the differences are minimal.

components/prism-asciidoc.js
components/prism-php.js
components/prism-flow.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `components/prism-java.js`: This file defines the Java language grammar. Since Apex is similar to Java, this file is crucial for understanding how Java is defined and whether it can be aliased or extended for Apex.
  
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including language management and tokenization. It is essential for understanding how new languages are added or aliased within Prism.js.

- `components/prism-asciidoc.js`: This file shows an example of how a language can be defined by extending an existing language (in this case, AsciiDoc extending markup). It can provide insights into how Apex could be defined by extending Java.

- `components/prism-php.js`: This file demonstrates how a language similar to another (PHP and C-like) can be defined with specific modifications. It can serve as a reference for defining Apex with specific modifications to the Java definition.

- `components/prism-flow.js`: This file shows how a language (Flow) can extend another language (JavaScript) with specific rules. It can provide guidance on how to extend the Java definition for Apex if necessary.
