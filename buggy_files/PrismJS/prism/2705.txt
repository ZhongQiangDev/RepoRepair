1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that template literals (`\``) are not being correctly highlighted after a specific sequence of code. Specifically, after a regex containing a single quote (`replace(/'/, `'`)`) and a comment with a template literal (`// `load bearing comment``), subsequent template literals (`\``) are not highlighted properly.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem seems to stem from how Prism.js handles template literals and comments. The regex and comment patterns might be interfering with the template literal parsing, causing the parser to lose track of the template literal syntax. This could be due to incorrect tokenization or a bug in the template literal handling logic.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   - The files most likely related to this issue are those that define the JavaScript language grammar and handle template literals, comments, and regex patterns.

```
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-js-templates.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-jsdoc.js
components/prism-javascript.js
```

- `components/prism-js-extras.js`: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting with additional patterns, including template literals and comments, which are likely involved in the issue.
- `components/prism-js-templates.js`: This file specifically handles template literals and their embedded content, which is directly related to the problem.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process, which might be where the bug originates.
- `components/prism-jsdoc.js`: This file handles JSDoc comments, which could be related if the comment handling logic is interfering with template literals.
- `components/prism-javascript.js`: This file defines the base JavaScript language grammar, which includes the initial setup for template literals and other syntax elements.
