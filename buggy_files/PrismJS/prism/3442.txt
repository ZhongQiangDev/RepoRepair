1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that quotes inside HTML attribute values are being highlighted as punctuation, which is not the intended behavior. In the example provided, the single quotes (`'`) within the `data` attribute value are being highlighted, which looks incorrect.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely related to how Prism.js handles punctuation within HTML attribute values. The current grammar rules for HTML attributes may not be correctly distinguishing between punctuation that should be part of the attribute value and punctuation that should be highlighted as punctuation.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-markup-templating.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```

- **`components/prism-markup.js`**: This file is crucial as it defines the core HTML syntax highlighting rules, including how attributes and their values are handled. The issue likely stems from how punctuation is defined within attribute values.
- **`components/prism-js-extras.js`**: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting, which might be relevant if the embedded JavaScript-like content within the attribute value is being misinterpreted.
- **`components/prism-markup-templating.js`**: This file handles templating within markup, which could be relevant if the issue involves templating syntax within attribute values.
- **`components/prism-core.js`**: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization and highlighting logic. It might contain general rules that affect how punctuation is handled.
- **`plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`**: This plugin adds custom highlighting for keywords, which might be affecting how certain characters within attribute values are interpreted.
