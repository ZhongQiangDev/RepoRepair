1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that an empty string (`''`) in Smalltalk syntax is not being handled correctly by Prism.js. Specifically, the text following the empty string is incorrectly highlighted as part of the string content, which should not be the case.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause likely lies in how Prism.js is defining its string patterns for Smalltalk. The regex pattern used to identify strings might be too greedy or not properly accounting for empty strings, causing it to incorrectly capture subsequent text as part of the string content.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-smalltalk.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-jsx.js
```

- `components/prism-smalltalk.js`: This file is directly responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Smalltalk. It likely contains the regex patterns for strings that need to be adjusted.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization and highlighting process. It might have general rules or configurations that affect how strings are handled.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin could be affecting how keywords are highlighted, which might interfere with string highlighting if not properly configured.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles inlined languages within markup, which might be relevant if Smalltalk is being used in a markup context.
- `components/prism-jsx.js`: This file handles JSX syntax, which might have similar string handling rules that could provide insights or conflicts with Smalltalk string handling.
