1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the shell session language ("shell-session") is not being tokenized correctly. The highlighting works fine in an earlier version of Prism.js but fails in more recent versions, including 1.22 and 1.23. The tokenizer seems to be treating the entire shell session as a single token, which results in no syntax highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from a change in the tokenizer or language definition for "shell-session" between the versions where it worked and where it doesn't. The problem could be due to a modification in how the tokenizer processes the shell session language, possibly affecting how it splits the input into tokens. Another possibility is that the language definition for "shell-session" has been altered or is not being loaded correctly in the newer versions.

   ```
   components/prism-shell-session.js
   components/prism-core.js
   plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
   plugins/command-line/prism-command-line.js
   components/prism-bash.js
   ```

   - `components/prism-shell-session.js`: This file defines the shell session language and its grammar rules. It is the most relevant file as it directly affects how shell session code is tokenized and highlighted.
   - `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenizer. Any changes here could affect how all languages, including shell session, are processed.
   - `plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`: This plugin ensures that original HTML markup is preserved during the highlighting process. If there are issues with how the shell session is being wrapped in HTML, this plugin could be involved.
   - `plugins/command-line/prism-command-line.js`: This plugin adds command-line-like functionality to code blocks, which could be relevant if the shell session is being treated as a command-line interface.
   - `components/prism-bash.js`: This file defines the Bash language, which is closely related to shell sessions. If there are issues with how Bash commands are being tokenized, it could affect shell session highlighting.
