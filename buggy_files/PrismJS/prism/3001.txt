1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The wrong behavior is that TypeScript keywords like `infer`, `type`, and `const` are incorrectly highlighted as keywords when followed by an alphabetic character. This causes incorrect syntax highlighting for identifiers that start with these keywords.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from the way the TypeScript grammar is defined in Prism.js. Specifically, the regex patterns used to match keywords might be too greedy or not properly bounded, causing them to match parts of identifiers that start with these keywords. This results in incorrect highlighting for valid identifiers.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-typescript.js
components/prism-tsx.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```

- `components/prism-typescript.js`: This file defines the core TypeScript grammar and is likely where the keyword matching patterns are defined. Adjusting the regex patterns here could fix the issue.
- `components/prism-tsx.js`: This file extends the TypeScript grammar for TSX, which might also be affected by the same keyword matching issue.
- `components/prism-js-extras.js`: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting and might contain additional rules that could influence how TypeScript keywords are handled.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization engine. Issues in the core engine could affect how keywords are matched.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin adds custom CSS classes for keywords, and its behavior might contribute to the highlighting issue.
