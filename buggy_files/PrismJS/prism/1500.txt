### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior in the GitHub problem description is that the SQL comment (`-- this is a comment`) is not being properly recognized as a comment. Instead, it appears to be incorrectly highlighted as part of the SQL code, leading to improper syntax highlighting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is likely due to the SQL language definition in Prism.js not correctly identifying the `--` as the start of a single-line comment. This could be due to a missing or incorrect regex pattern for SQL comments in the language definition.

### 3. Related Files
The files most related to this issue are those that define the SQL language grammar and handle comment recognition. Here are the top 5 files, ordered by importance:

```
components/prism-sql.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
components/prism-markup.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```

- `components/prism-sql.js`: This file defines the SQL language grammar and should contain the rules for recognizing SQL comments. It is the most critical file to address the issue.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization and highlighting process. It may contain general rules that could affect comment recognition.
- `plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`: This plugin ensures that custom HTML markup is preserved during highlighting. While not directly related to SQL comments, it could interact with the highlighting process.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles inlined languages within markup, which might be relevant if the SQL code is embedded in another language.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin adds custom CSS classes to keyword tokens. Although it focuses on keywords, it could indirectly affect how comments are highlighted if there are conflicts in token types.
