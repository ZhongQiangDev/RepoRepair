1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the JSON tokenization is breaking when encountering the string `/*`. This causes the syntax highlighting to incorrectly interpret the string as the start of a comment, leading to improper highlighting of the subsequent lines.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the JSON language definition in Prism.js not properly handling the `/*` string as a literal value. Instead, it is being misinterpreted as the start of a comment, which is a common syntax in other languages like JavaScript. This misinterpretation disrupts the tokenization process, resulting in incorrect highlighting.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-json.js
plugins/normalize-whitespace/prism-normalize-whitespace.js
components/prism-markup.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```

- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process. It is crucial for understanding how tokens are processed and where the misinterpretation might occur.
- `components/prism-json.js`: This file defines the JSON language grammar. The issue is likely related to how strings are defined and handled within this grammar.
- `plugins/normalize-whitespace/prism-normalize-whitespace.js`: This plugin might be affecting the whitespace handling, which could influence how the `/*` string is interpreted.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: Although primarily for markup languages, it includes general string handling that might be relevant if there's a shared pattern for string definitions.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin could be affecting how keywords and special characters are highlighted, which might be related to the issue if `/*` is being treated as a keyword or special sequence.
