1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that attributes in Elixir ending with a `?` are not being correctly highlighted as tokens. Specifically, `attribute?:` is not being recognized as an `attr-name`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is that the regex pattern used to identify `attr-name` tokens in the Elixir language definition does not include an optional question mark (`?`) at the end. This results in `attribute?:` not being matched as an `attr-name`.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   components/prism-elixir.js
   components/prism-core.js
   ```

   - `components/prism-elixir.js`: This file contains the language definition for Elixir, including the regex patterns used for tokenization. The issue described is directly related to the regex pattern for `attr-name` in this file.
   - `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process. While the issue is specific to the Elixir language definition, understanding the core tokenization process may be helpful for debugging and ensuring the fix integrates correctly.
