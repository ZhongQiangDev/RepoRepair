1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that when a CSS value and the `!important` statement are specified together, the `!important` part is not recognized as a separate token. Instead, it is treated as part of the value, which leads to incorrect syntax highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the CSS grammar rules in Prism.js not properly separating the `!important` keyword from the CSS value. The current regex patterns used for tokenizing CSS values and properties may not account for the `!important` keyword as a distinct token.

- `prism.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the main tokenization and highlighting logic. It is crucial for understanding how tokens are processed and where the issue might originate.
- `components/prism-css.js`: This file defines the CSS-specific grammar rules and patterns. It is directly responsible for how CSS tokens are recognized and highlighted, making it the primary file to address the issue.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles inlined languages within markup, which could be relevant if the issue also affects inline CSS within HTML.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin adds custom CSS classes to keyword tokens, which might be useful for ensuring `!important` is treated as a keyword.
- `plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`: This plugin preserves HTML markup during highlighting, which could be relevant if the issue involves inline styles within HTML.
