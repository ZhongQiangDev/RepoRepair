1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that certain parts of the `.cshtml` code, such as helper methods (`@helper`), C# attributes (`@Localize.GetLabelHtml`), and Razor syntax (`@{ ... }`), are not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, the helper method and C# attributes are not being recognized and highlighted as expected.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause likely lies in the way the `cshtml` language definition is set up in Prism.js. The grammar rules for `cshtml` may not be correctly identifying and highlighting these specific constructs. This could be due to missing or incorrect regex patterns for these elements in the `cshtml` language definition.

```
components/prism-cshtml.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-markup-templating.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-core.js
```

- `components/prism-cshtml.js`: This file defines the specific grammar rules for `.cshtml` files. It is the most relevant file as it directly controls how `.cshtml` code is highlighted.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file extends the base markup language support, which `.cshtml` builds upon. It may contain rules that need to be adjusted for `.cshtml` specific constructs.
- `components/prism-markup-templating.js`: This file handles templating within markup languages, which is relevant for the Razor syntax used in `.cshtml`.
- `components/prism-js-extras.js`: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting, which could be relevant for the C# attributes and helper methods that involve JavaScript-like constructs.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process. While less directly related, it may contain settings or hooks that affect how `.cshtml` is processed.
