1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The wrong behavior is that Prism.js is not correctly highlighting C++ literals that use single quotes (`'`) as digit separators. The numbers with single quotes are being incorrectly interpreted as strings or other tokens, leading to improper syntax highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely due to the existing regex patterns in Prism.js for C++ number literals not accounting for single quotes as valid digit separators. The current regex patterns for numbers do not include `'` as a valid character within the number sequence, causing the parser to treat the single quotes as string delimiters or other tokens.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-cpp.js
components/prism-core.js
tests/languages/cpp/separating_single_quotes_feature.test
components/prism-c.js
plugins/normalize-whitespace/prism-normalize-whitespace.js
```

- `components/prism-cpp.js`: This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for C++. The issue likely lies in the regex patterns used to define number literals, which need to be updated to include single quotes as valid digit separators.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process. It may need to be checked to ensure that the updated regex patterns are correctly applied and that the tokenization logic handles the new patterns appropriately.
- `tests/languages/cpp/separating_single_quotes_feature.test`: This file contains test cases for the C++ language. Adding new test cases for the single quote digit separator feature will help ensure that the fix works as expected.
- `components/prism-c.js`: Since C++ is an extension of C, the base C language definition might also need to be checked to ensure consistency in handling number literals.
- `plugins/normalize-whitespace/prism-normalize-whitespace.js`: Although less directly related, this plugin handles whitespace normalization. It's worth checking to ensure that the single quotes used as digit separators are not inadvertently removed or altered during normalization.
