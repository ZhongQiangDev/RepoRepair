1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - PrismJS is not correctly highlighting class names in C++ code. Specifically, it fails to highlight `QMainWindow` in the class definition and `MainWindow` in the method definition.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from the C++ language definition in PrismJS not having the appropriate rules to recognize and highlight class names in these specific contexts. The grammar rules for C++ may not be comprehensive enough to cover all class name scenarios, particularly when they appear in inheritance or method definitions.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-cpp.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-java.js
components/prism-php.js
components/prism-java.js
```

- **`components/prism-cpp.js`**: This file is the most critical as it defines the C++ language grammar for PrismJS. It needs to be updated to include rules for recognizing and highlighting class names in the specific contexts mentioned in the problem description.
- **`components/prism-core.js`**: This file contains the core functionality of PrismJS, including tokenization and highlighting. Any changes to the C++ grammar might need adjustments here to ensure proper integration.
- **`components/prism-java.js`**: While not directly related to C++, this file shows how class names are handled in another object-oriented language. It can serve as a reference for implementing similar rules in C++.
- **`components/prism-php.js`**: Similar to the Java file, this can provide additional insights into how class names are highlighted in another language with similar syntax.
- **`components/prism-java.js`**: This file is listed twice by mistake. It should be replaced with another relevant file if needed, but the first three files are the most important for addressing the issue.
