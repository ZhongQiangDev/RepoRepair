1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that comments in Visual Basic code are not being highlighted correctly when they span multiple lines using the line continuation character (`_`). The comment highlighting stops at the end of the first line instead of continuing to the end of the comment block.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely due to how the Visual Basic language definition in Prism.js handles comments and line continuations. The current grammar rules for comments may not account for the line continuation character, causing the highlighting to terminate prematurely at the end of the first line.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-vb.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
components/prism-batch.js
```

- `components/prism-vb.js`: This file contains the Visual Basic language definition and is the primary file that needs to be modified to correctly handle line continuation in comments.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including tokenization and highlighting. It may need to be checked to ensure that it properly handles the updated grammar rules for Visual Basic.
- `plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`: This plugin ensures that custom HTML markup is preserved during highlighting. It might be relevant if the issue involves preserving specific markup within the Visual Basic code.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin adds custom CSS classes to keyword tokens. It might be relevant if the issue involves highlighting specific keywords within the Visual Basic comments.
- `components/prism-batch.js`: This file contains the Batch language definition, which also uses line continuation characters. It might provide useful examples or patterns for handling line continuations in comments.
