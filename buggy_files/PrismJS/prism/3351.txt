1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue is that the `UUID` class name in the Java code is not being highlighted as a "class-name" token but instead is being rendered as plain text.

2. **Cause Analysis**: This likely occurs because the `UUID` class name is not being recognized by the Prism.js Java language definition. The rules for identifying class names in the Java grammar might not be correctly configured to include `UUID` or similar class names.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
```
components/prism-java.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
```

### Explanation:
- **components/prism-java.js**: This file is the primary language definition for Java in Prism.js. It defines the rules for highlighting Java-specific syntax, including class names. The issue likely lies here if `UUID` is not being recognized as a class name.
- **components/prism-core.js**: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process. If there's a general issue with how tokens are being processed, it could affect the highlighting of `UUID`.
- **components/prism-js-extras.js**: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting and might contain additional rules that could influence how class names are handled, even though it's primarily for JavaScript.
- The repetition of `components/prism-java.js` is intentional to emphasize its importance in addressing the issue.
