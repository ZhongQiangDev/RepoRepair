1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the ANSI-C quoting (`$'...'`) in the Bash code snippet is not being highlighted correctly. Specifically, the `\n` within the quoted string is causing the highlighting to trip up, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from how Prism.js handles escape sequences within strings in the Bash language definition. The current rules for Bash strings in Prism.js may not properly account for the `\n` escape sequence within ANSI-C quoted strings (`$'...'`), leading to incorrect tokenization and highlighting.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-bash.js

components/prism-core.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
components/prism-markup.js
```

- `components/prism-bash.js`: This file contains the specific rules for Bash syntax highlighting, including string handling. It is the most relevant file as it directly defines how Bash strings, including ANSI-C quoted strings, are tokenized and highlighted.
- `prism.js`: This is the core file of Prism.js, which contains the main functionality for syntax highlighting. It is essential for understanding how the highlighting process works and how different language definitions interact.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains core utilities and functions used by Prism.js, including tokenization and highlighting logic. It is important for understanding the overall flow of the highlighting process.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin allows for custom CSS class assignment to keyword tokens, which might be relevant if the issue involves keyword highlighting within strings.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles syntax highlighting for embedded languages within markup. While not directly related to Bash, it might be relevant if the issue involves how embedded Bash code is handled within other contexts.
