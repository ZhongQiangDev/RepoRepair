1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that single quotes within double-quoted strings are not being properly handled, causing incorrect syntax highlighting. Specifically, the single quote in "It's" is not being recognized as part of the string, leading to improper highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely due to the string parsing rules for the D language in Prism.js. The current rules may not correctly handle single quotes within double-quoted strings, leading to the syntax highlighting engine misinterpreting the string boundaries.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-d.js
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-markup.js
plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```

- `components/prism-d.js`: This file contains the language definition for the D programming language. It is the most relevant file as it defines the syntax rules for D, including string handling.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization and highlighting process. It is essential for understanding how the highlighting engine processes the code.
- `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles markup languages and includes rules for inlined languages. It may be relevant if the issue involves how strings are handled within a broader context of markup.
- `plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`: This plugin ensures that custom HTML markup is preserved during highlighting. It might be relevant if the issue involves how the highlighting engine interacts with HTML elements.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin adds custom CSS classes to keyword tokens. While less directly related, it could be relevant if the issue involves how keywords within strings are handled.
