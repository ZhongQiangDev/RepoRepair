1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The keyword `isolated` in the function parameter type is not being highlighted as a keyword. It should be highlighted similarly to other Swift keywords.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from the Swift language definition in Prism.js not including `isolated` as a recognized keyword. This means the regex patterns used to identify keywords in Swift do not match `isolated`, so it is not highlighted appropriately.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-swift.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-typescript.js
```

- `components/prism-swift.js`: This file contains the Swift language definition and is the primary file that needs to be updated to include `isolated` as a keyword.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file initializes Prism.js and contains core functionality. It may need to be checked to ensure that the Swift language definition is properly loaded and applied.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin allows for custom keyword highlighting. It might be useful if additional customization is needed for highlighting specific keywords.
- `components/prism-js-extras.js`: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting and might contain additional patterns or utilities that could be relevant for Swift extensions.
- `components/prism-typescript.js`: Although this file is for TypeScript, it might provide useful examples or patterns for extending language definitions with additional keywords.
