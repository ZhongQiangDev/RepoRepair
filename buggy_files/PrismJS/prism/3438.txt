1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the URL string within the `@import` statement is being incorrectly highlighted. Instead of being treated as a single string, parts of the URL are being interpreted as separate tokens, such as `https`, `Inter`, `wght`, etc.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the CSS grammar definition in Prism.js. The current grammar rules for URLs or strings within CSS might not be correctly handling the URL format, causing it to break the URL into multiple tokens instead of recognizing it as a single string.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   components/prism-css.js
   components/prism-css-extras.js
   components/prism-core.js
   plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
   docs/scripts/prettify/prettify.js
   ```

   - `components/prism-css.js`: This file defines the core CSS syntax highlighting rules, including the handling of URLs and strings. It is the most relevant file as it directly affects how CSS code is tokenized and highlighted.
   - `components/prism-css-extras.js`: This file extends the CSS highlighting rules with additional patterns for CSS features. It may contain rules that could be affecting the URL string highlighting.
   - `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization process. Issues in the core tokenization logic could also contribute to the problem.
   - `plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`: This plugin ensures that markup elements are preserved during syntax highlighting. While less directly related, it could interact with the highlighting process in ways that affect the URL string.
   - `docs/scripts/prettify/prettify.js`: This file contains a core syntax highlighting function that might be used in conjunction with Prism.js. Although it is less likely to be directly responsible, it could still play a role in the overall highlighting process.
