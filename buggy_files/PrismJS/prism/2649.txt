1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the `#` symbol in shell commands is being incorrectly identified as a shell-symbol token, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from the regex pattern used to identify shell symbols in the `prism-shell-session.js` file. The pattern may be too broad, causing it to incorrectly match `#` as a shell symbol instead of recognizing it as a comment character.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   components/prism-shell-session.js
   components/prism-bash.js
   plugins/command-line/prism-command-line.js
   components/prism-core.js
   components/prism-markup.js
   ```

   - `components/prism-shell-session.js`: This file defines the syntax highlighting rules for shell sessions, including the problematic handling of `#` as a shell symbol.
   - `components/prism-bash.js`: This file contains the syntax highlighting rules for Bash, which may also influence how shell commands are parsed.
   - `plugins/command-line/prism-command-line.js`: This plugin adds command-line-like functionality, which could interact with shell session highlighting.
   - `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains core functions for Prism, including the `highlightAll` function, which might be involved in the overall highlighting process.
   - `components/prism-markup.js`: This file handles markup language highlighting, which could be relevant if the shell session is embedded within a markup context.
