1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that the `type` attribute in the TypeScript interface is being incorrectly highlighted as a keyword, which is not the intended behavior. The `type` here is an optional property of the interface, not a TypeScript keyword.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely due to the TypeScript language definition in Prism.js incorrectly identifying the `type` keyword in contexts where it should be treated as a property name. This could be due to the regex patterns used for keyword detection being too broad or not properly excluding property names.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-typescript.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
components/prism-jsdoc.js
```

- `components/prism-typescript.js`: This file defines the TypeScript language rules and is the primary source for how TypeScript syntax is highlighted. It likely contains the regex patterns that are incorrectly matching the `type` property as a keyword.
- `components/prism-js-extras.js`: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting and may contain additional rules that could be affecting TypeScript highlighting.
- `components/prism-core.js`: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization and highlighting process. Issues in the core logic could contribute to the problem.
- `plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`: This plugin specifically handles keyword highlighting and could be influencing how keywords are identified and styled.
- `components/prism-jsdoc.js`: While primarily for JSDoc comments, it may contain rules that interact with TypeScript syntax, potentially affecting property name recognition.
