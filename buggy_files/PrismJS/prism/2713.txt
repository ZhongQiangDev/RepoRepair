1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that constants (`$from`, `$to`) are being incorrectly recognized as keywords in the syntax highlighting. This results in improper styling and visual representation of these constants in the code.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript in Prism.js not correctly distinguishing between constants and keywords. Specifically, the rules for identifying keywords might be too broad, causing them to incorrectly match variable names that start with `$`.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   The files most relevant to this issue are those that define the JavaScript syntax highlighting rules and potentially any extensions or customizations related to JavaScript highlighting.

- `components/prism-js-templates.js`: This file handles tagged template literals and embedded languages within JavaScript, which could influence how certain patterns are matched.
- `components/prism-jsdoc.js`: This file extends Prism's support for JSDoc comments in JavaScript, which might include rules affecting the recognition of certain symbols or patterns.
- `components/prism-js.js`: This file contains the core JavaScript syntax highlighting rules, including the definition of keywords and other language constructs.
- `prism-core.js`: This file is the core of Prism.js and contains fundamental utilities and configurations that could influence how language rules are applied.
