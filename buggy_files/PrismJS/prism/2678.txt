### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The GitHub problem description indicates that the current implementation does not support the display of images within Markdown content. Specifically, the image token `![emoji](https://content.markdowner.net/emoji/g/64/1f44d.png)` is not being rendered as an image.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is likely due to the absence of a specific rule or handler in the Markdown parser or syntax highlighter that recognizes and processes image tokens. The Markdown parser needs to be configured to interpret the `![alt](url)` syntax and render it as an `<img>` tag in the final HTML output.

### Step 3: Identify Related Files
Based on the repository information, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
components/prism-markdown.js
components/prism-markup.js
plugins/unescaped-markup/prism-unescaped-markup.js
docs/scripts/collapse.js
docs/scripts/linenumber.js
```

### Explanation:
1. **`components/prism-markdown.js`**: This file is directly responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Markdown. It needs to be updated to include support for image tokens.
2. **`components/prism-markup.js`**: This file handles markup languages, including HTML. Since images are rendered as HTML `<img>` tags, this file might need adjustments to ensure proper integration with Markdown image tokens.
3. **`plugins/unescaped-markup/prism-unescaped-markup.js`**: This plugin enhances Prism.js to handle unescaped markup. It might need to be adjusted to ensure that Markdown images are properly processed and rendered.
4. **`docs/scripts/collapse.js`**: This script manages the visibility of submenu items in navigation. While not directly related to image support, it might need to be checked if the navigation includes links to pages with images.
5. **`docs/scripts/linenumber.js`**: This script highlights specific lines of code based on the URL's hash fragment. It might need to be reviewed to ensure it doesn't interfere with the rendering of Markdown images.
