### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when using the spread operator (`{...}`) within JSX attributes, the syntax highlighting breaks, causing incorrect colorization of the code. Specifically, the spread operator and its contents are not highlighted correctly, leading to a visual inconsistency compared to when attributes are written out explicitly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prism.js handles the spread operator within JSX attributes. The current regex patterns and tokenization rules for JSX in Prism.js may not be fully accounting for the spread operator syntax, leading to incorrect tokenization and, consequently, incorrect highlighting. This could be due to the spread operator being treated as an unexpected or unrecognized construct within the context of JSX attributes.

```
components/prism-jsx.js
components/prism-js-extras.js
components/prism-core.js
plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js
plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js
```

**Explanation:**

- **`components/prism-jsx.js`**: This file is responsible for defining the JSX language rules in Prism.js. It is the most relevant file because it directly handles the syntax highlighting for JSX, including tags, attributes, and embedded JavaScript expressions. The issue with the spread operator likely needs to be addressed here.

- **`components/prism-js-extras.js`**: This file extends JavaScript syntax highlighting with additional patterns and aliases. Since JSX is an extension of JavaScript, any additional rules or patterns related to JavaScript syntax (like the spread operator) might be relevant here.

- **`components/prism-core.js`**: This file contains the core functionality of Prism.js, including the tokenization logic. If the issue is related to how tokens are being processed or matched, changes might be needed in this file.

- **`plugins/keep-markup/prism-keep-markup.js`**: This plugin ensures that original HTML markup is preserved during syntax highlighting. While not directly related to the spread operator, it might be relevant if the issue involves how Prism.js handles nested or complex JSX structures.

- **`plugins/highlight-keywords/prism-highlight-keywords.js`**: This plugin adds custom CSS classes to keyword tokens. If the spread operator is being incorrectly identified as a keyword or another token type, this plugin might need adjustments.
