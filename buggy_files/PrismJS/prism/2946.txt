1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that reST (reStructuredText) links and verbatim elements are not being properly detected and highlighted by Prism.js. Instead, the entire text is being rendered as italicized text, indicating that the syntax highlighting rules for reST are not correctly identifying these elements.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause likely lies in the lack of specific grammar rules within Prism.js for handling reST links and verbatim elements. The current rules may not be recognizing the backticks (`) used for inline literals or the link syntax (`...`_). This results in the entire text being treated as plain text and styled incorrectly.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
components/prism-core.js
components/prism-markup.js
components/prism-latex.js
components/prism-asciidoc.js
docs/scripts/linenumber.js
```

- **components/prism-core.js**: This file initializes the core functionality of Prism.js, including the language definitions and tokenization process. It is crucial for ensuring that the reST language is properly registered and processed.
- **components/prism-markup.js**: This file handles syntax highlighting for markup languages, which may include some rules that could be relevant for reST. It might need adjustments to properly handle reST-specific syntax.
- **components/prism-latex.js**: LaTeX and reST share some similarities in syntax, particularly with respect to inline literals and links. This file might provide insights or reusable patterns for handling reST.
- **components/prism-asciidoc.js**: Asciidoc is another markup language with similar features to reST. This file could offer useful patterns or rules for handling inline literals and links.
- **docs/scripts/linenumber.js**: While not directly related to syntax highlighting, this file might be relevant if line numbers or specific line highlighting is affecting the rendering of reST elements.
