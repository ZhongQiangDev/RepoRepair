1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that when the content of the tabs exceeds the available space, the tabs do not support scrolling via dragging or keyboard navigation. This makes it inconvenient for users to access tabs that are not initially visible.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely lies in the implementation of the tab component, specifically in how it handles overflow and scrolling. The tab component may not be configured to enable dragging or keyboard navigation for scrolling when the content exceeds the container's width. This could be due to missing event listeners for drag events or keyboard events, or the absence of a scrollable container that supports these interactions.

- `src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx`: This file is crucial as it manages the tab navigation system, including overflow handling and scrolling behavior. It likely needs modifications to support dragging and keyboard navigation for scrolling.
- `src/tab/tab.jsx`: This file contains the main `Tab` component, which manages the overall tab interface. It may need adjustments to ensure proper integration with the navigation component.
- `src/tab/tabs/content.jsx`: This file manages the content within the tabs. While not directly related to scrolling, it ensures that the content is displayed correctly when tabs are navigated.
- `docs/tab/adaptor/index.jsx`: This file configures tab properties and renders the tabbed interface. It may need updates to ensure compatibility with the new scrolling behavior.
- `docs/tab/theme/index.jsx`: This file contains demo showcases for tab components. It should be updated to reflect the new scrolling functionality for demonstration purposes.
