### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described involves a table with a custom header that includes a checkbox for selecting all rows. The problem appears to be that the checkbox in the header does not function as expected for selecting all rows in the table. The image shows a checkbox in the header, but it seems that clicking it does not select all the rows as intended.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue could be related to the following:

- **Incorrect Event Handling**: The checkbox in the header might not be properly wired to trigger the selection of all rows.
- **State Management**: The state that tracks the selection of rows might not be updated correctly when the header checkbox is clicked.
- **Rendering Logic**: The logic that determines which rows are selected might not be correctly reflecting the state of the header checkbox.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
src/table/selection.jsx
src/table/base.jsx
docs/table/theme/index.jsx
src/table/expanded/row.jsx
src/table/tree/cell.jsx
```

### Explanation:

- **`src/table/selection.jsx`**: This file likely contains the logic for row selection, including the handling of the "select all" checkbox in the header. It is crucial for managing the selection state and ensuring that clicking the header checkbox selects all rows.
  
- **`src/table/base.jsx`**: This file contains the core `Table` component, which manages the overall table structure and rendering. It might include the logic for integrating the selection functionality with the table's rendering.

- **`docs/table/theme/index.jsx`**: This file contains the demo components for the table, including the `TableFunctionDemo` and `FunctionDemo` classes. It might have examples or configurations that could be relevant to the issue.

- **`src/table/expanded/row.jsx`**: This file handles the rendering of rows, including the logic for displaying and managing row selection. It might be involved in ensuring that the rows are correctly selected when the header checkbox is clicked.

- **`src/table/tree/cell.jsx`**: This file manages the rendering of cells within a tree-structured table. While it may not be directly related to the header checkbox, it could be relevant if the table includes hierarchical data and the selection logic needs to account for this structure.
