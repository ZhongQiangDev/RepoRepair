### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is that setting `timePanelProps.defaultValue` in the `DatePicker2` component results in an "Invalid Date" being displayed. This suggests that the default value provided is not being correctly parsed or handled by the component, leading to an invalid date being shown.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `timePanelProps.defaultValue` is being processed within the `DatePicker2` component. The `defaultValue` might not be in the expected format or might not be properly validated and converted into a valid date object before being used. This could be due to:

- Incorrect parsing of the `defaultValue` in the `timePanelProps`.
- The `defaultValue` not being compatible with the `moment.js` or `dayjs` library used for date handling.
- An issue in the `TimePanel` or `TimePickerPanel` components where the `defaultValue` is not correctly applied.
