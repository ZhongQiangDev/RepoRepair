1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is a memory leak in the `ConfigProvider` component when used in a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) environment. The memory usage grows over time and is not being garbage collected, as the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method is not being called in SSR scenarios.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that in SSR, the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method is not triggered, which means the internal cache in `ConfigProvider` is not being cleared. This leads to a memory leak as the cache continues to grow without being cleaned up.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/config-provider/index.jsx
src/config-provider/cache.js
src/config-provider/config.jsx
src/config-provider/consumer.jsx
src/config-provider/get-context-props.jsx
```

- `src/config-provider/index.jsx`: This is the main file for the `ConfigProvider` component, where the core logic and lifecycle methods are defined. It is crucial for understanding and fixing the memory leak issue.
- `src/config-provider/cache.js`: This file manages the cache used by `ConfigProvider`. Since the issue involves a memory leak related to the cache, this file is highly relevant.
- `src/config-provider/config.jsx`: This file contains utility functions for managing configurations, including locale and direction settings. It may be involved in the initialization and cleanup processes.
- `src/config-provider/consumer.jsx`: This file handles the transformation of context keys and may be relevant for ensuring proper cleanup of context-related data.
- `src/config-provider/get-context-props.jsx`: This file resolves context props, which could be important for ensuring that the correct context is passed and cleaned up properly.
