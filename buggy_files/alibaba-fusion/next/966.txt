### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `Group` component in the `Nav` menu is incorrectly interpreting spaces in the `label` prop as multiple `children` elements, leading to an error. This results in the `Group` component failing to render correctly and throwing an error related to `className` being undefined.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `Group` component processes its `label` prop. When a `label` with spaces is provided, the component might be splitting the string into multiple parts and treating each part as a separate child element. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as trying to access properties like `className` on undefined objects.
