### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The issue described is that when the `Dialog` component does not have a `title` prop, the close button's position is incorrect, causing it to overlap with the text content.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue likely stems from the way the `Dialog` component handles the layout when the `title` prop is omitted. Without a title, the positioning of the close button may not be adjusted correctly, leading to the overlap with the content.
