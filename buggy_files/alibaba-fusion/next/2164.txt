1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the sorting icons in the table do not have a `cursor: pointer` style applied to them. This means that when a user hovers over the sorting icons, the cursor does not change to indicate that the icons are clickable.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the CSS styles not being correctly applied to the sorting icons. Specifically, the `cursor: pointer` style is missing from the CSS rules that target the sorting icons. This could be due to the styles not being defined, not being applied correctly, or being overridden by other styles.
