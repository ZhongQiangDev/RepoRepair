### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `selected` parameter in the `extra` object of the `Tree` component does not toggle correctly when a node is clicked. Specifically:
- The first click on a node sets `selected` to `false`.
- Subsequent clicks do not change the `selected` value, and the CSS styles do not update accordingly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause appears to be related to how the `selected` state is being managed and updated within the `Tree` component. The `extra.selected` value is not being toggled correctly, which suggests a problem with the state management or the event handler responsible for updating the selection state.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the repository information and the problem description, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
docs/tree/adaptor/index.jsx
docs/tree/theme/index.jsx
src/tree/selection.jsx
```

### Explanation:

1. **`src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx`**: This file defines the `TreeNode` component, which is responsible for rendering individual nodes in the tree. The issue with the `selected` state likely involves how this component handles selection events and updates its state.

2. **`src/tree/view/tree.jsx`**: This file contains the main `Tree` component, which manages the overall tree structure and state. It likely contains the logic for handling selection events and propagating them to individual nodes.

3. **`docs/tree/adaptor/index.jsx`**: This file contains functions that configure and adapt the `Tree` component for different use cases. It might include logic related to the `selected` state and how it is managed.

4. **`docs/tree/theme/index.jsx`**: This file contains the rendering logic for the `Tree` component, including the `FunctionDemo` and `FunctionDemoLine` classes. It might include the CSS styles that are not updating correctly based on the `selected` state.

5. **`src/tree/selection.jsx`**: This file likely contains the selection logic for the `Tree` component, including how the `selected` state is managed and updated. It might be responsible for the issue with the `selected` state not toggling correctly.
