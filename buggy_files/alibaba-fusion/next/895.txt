### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The GitHub problem description indicates that in `iconOnly` mode, navigation items without configured icons should not display a blank space. However, the screenshot shows that items without icons are still rendered with a blank space, which is not the expected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The issue likely stems from how the `Nav` component handles the rendering of items in `iconOnly` mode. Specifically, the component might not be properly checking whether an icon is configured for each item and is instead rendering a placeholder or empty space for items without icons.

### 3. Related Files
Based on the analysis, the following files are most relevant to the issue, ordered by importance:

```
docs/nav/theme/index.jsx
src/nav/item.jsx
src/nav/nav.jsx
src/nav/group.jsx
src/nav/sub-nav.jsx
```

- `docs/nav/theme/index.jsx`: This file contains the `FuncDemoVer` and `FuncDemoHoz` classes, which render vertical and horizontal navigation demos. It is crucial for understanding how the `iconOnly` mode is applied and how items are rendered in this mode.
- `src/nav/item.jsx`: This file defines the `Item` class, which is responsible for rendering individual navigation items. It likely contains the logic for handling icons and their display.
- `src/nav/nav.jsx`: This file contains the `Nav` class, which is the main navigation component. It manages the overall navigation structure and may contain logic related to `iconOnly` mode.
- `src/nav/group.jsx`: This file defines the `Group` class, which is used to group navigation items. It may also play a role in how items are rendered in `iconOnly` mode.
- `src/nav/sub-nav.jsx`: This file contains the `SubNav` class, which handles sub-navigation items. It might also be involved in the rendering logic for items in `iconOnly` mode.
