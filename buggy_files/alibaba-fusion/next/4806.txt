1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue described is that after selecting all results in a search within the `CascaderSelect` component, the search results do not clear automatically. This leaves the user on the search results page even though all items have been selected, requiring them to click outside the dropdown to return to the main list.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The core issue seems to be related to the state management of the search results and the selection process within the `CascaderSelect` component. Specifically, there is no mechanism to automatically clear the search results once all items have been selected. Additionally, there is no user interface element (like a button) to manually clear the search results.
