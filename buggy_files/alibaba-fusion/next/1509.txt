1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `popupContainer` configuration set in `ConfigProvider` does not affect the `Dialog` component. This results in the `Dialog` not being rendered in the specified container, leading to layout issues as shown in the image.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause likely lies in how the `popupContainer` prop is being passed down from `ConfigProvider` to the `Dialog` component. The `ConfigProvider` might not be correctly propagating this prop to the `Dialog`, or the `Dialog` component might not be set up to accept and utilize the `popupContainer` prop.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/dialog/dialog.jsx
src/config-provider/error-boundary.jsx
types/config-provider/index.d.ts
src/overlay/popup.jsx
types/dialog/index.d.ts
```

- `src/dialog/dialog.jsx`: This file contains the core implementation of the `Dialog` component. It needs to be checked to ensure it correctly handles the `popupContainer` prop.
- `src/config-provider/error-boundary.jsx`: This file might contain logic related to how props are passed down from `ConfigProvider` to child components. It could be relevant if there's an issue with prop propagation.
- `types/config-provider/index.d.ts`: This file defines the types for `ConfigProvider` props. It should be checked to ensure that `popupContainer` is correctly defined and passed down.
- `src/overlay/popup.jsx`: This file contains the `Popup` component, which might be used internally by `Dialog`. It could be relevant if the `popupContainer` prop needs to be handled by the `Popup` component.
- `types/dialog/index.d.ts`: This file defines the types for `Dialog` props. It should be checked to ensure that `popupContainer` is correctly defined for the `Dialog` component.
