### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when the keyboard focus moves to the `NumberPicker` component, the operation buttons (increment/decrement buttons) are not visible, and the focus state of the `NumberPicker` disappears. The expected behavior is that the operation buttons should be visible when focused, and the focus state should be maintained using `:focus-within`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the following areas:
- The CSS styles for the `NumberPicker` component may not be correctly handling the `:focus-within` pseudo-class to maintain the focus state when the operation buttons are focused.
- The visibility of the operation buttons might not be controlled properly when the `NumberPicker` is focused.
- The event handling for keyboard focus might not be correctly implemented to ensure the buttons are visible and the focus state is maintained.
