1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is a TypeScript type error related to the `onBlur` event handler in the `Input.TextArea` component. The error indicates that the type of the `onBlur` property is incompatible, specifically that a function expecting a `MouseEvent` is being assigned to a function that expects no arguments.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause of the error is that the `onBlur` property in the `InputProps` interface is defined as a function that takes no arguments (`() => void`), but the actual implementation or usage of `onBlur` is passing a `MouseEvent` as an argument. This mismatch in the function signature leads to the TypeScript type error.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
types/input/index.d.ts
src/input/textarea.jsx
src/util/events.js
src/input/input.jsx
src/form/form.jsx
```

- `types/input/index.d.ts`: This file defines the `InputProps` interface where the `onBlur` property is incorrectly typed. Correcting the type here will resolve the type mismatch.
- `src/input/textarea.jsx`: This file contains the implementation of the `TextArea` component where the `onBlur` event is likely being handled. It needs to be updated to match the correct type.
- `src/util/events.js`: This file contains utility functions for handling events, which might be used in the `TextArea` component. Ensuring these functions are correctly typed can help avoid similar issues.
- `src/input/input.jsx`: This file contains the `Input` component, which might share similar event handling logic with the `TextArea` component. Reviewing this file can help ensure consistency.
- `src/form/form.jsx`: This file contains the `Form` component, which might also use the `Input` and `TextArea` components. Ensuring it handles events correctly can help prevent propagation of the issue.
