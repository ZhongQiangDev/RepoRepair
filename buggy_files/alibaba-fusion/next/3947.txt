### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that when a custom wrapper component (`BizFormItem`) is used within a `Form`, the `useLabelForErrorMessage` API does not work as expected. This is because the custom wrapper component modifies the DOM structure, which interferes with the `useLabelForErrorMessage` functionality.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the `errorMessageLabel` prop not being properly passed down or utilized within the `Form.Item` component. The `useLabelForErrorMessage` API relies on the label being correctly associated with the error message, but the custom wrapper (`BizFormItem`) may not be passing this information correctly.

- `src/form/item.jsx`: This file contains the `Item` class, which is the core component for form items. It likely needs to be updated to handle the `errorMessageLabel` prop correctly.
- `src/form/error.jsx`: This file defines the `Error` component, which is responsible for displaying validation errors. It may need adjustments to work with the new `errorMessageLabel` API.
- `types/form/index.d.ts`: This file contains the TypeScript definitions for form-related components. It should be updated to include the new `errorMessageLabel` prop.
- `src/util/pick-attrs.js`: This utility function filters and validates DOM attributes. It might need to be updated to ensure the `errorMessageLabel` prop is properly passed down.
- `docs/core/theme/form-element.jsx`: This file contains a demo utility for form elements. It may need to be updated to reflect the new API and ensure it works correctly with custom wrappers.
