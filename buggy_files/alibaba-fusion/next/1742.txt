### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `Cascader` component currently displays a title for each item in the dropdown menu. The user wants an API to remove or hide these titles, allowing for a cleaner display of the hierarchical data without the additional text.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The current implementation of the `Cascader` component likely includes a default behavior where titles are always rendered for each item. This behavior is probably hardcoded or lacks an option to disable titles. To address this, the component needs an API that allows users to control whether titles are displayed.

- `docs/cascader/theme/index.jsx`: This file handles the rendering of the `Cascader` component in a demo environment. It may need adjustments to demonstrate the new API.
- `src/cascader/item.jsx`: This file defines the individual items within the `Cascader` menu. It likely contains the logic for rendering titles for each item.
- `src/cascader/menu.jsx`: This file manages the menu rendering logic for the `Cascader` component. It may need modifications to handle the new API for title visibility.
