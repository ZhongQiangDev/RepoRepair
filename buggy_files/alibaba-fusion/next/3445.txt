### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The problem described is that when an `id` attribute is added to the `Rating` component and the score is changed, the `onChange` event is triggered twice instead of once. This results in two console logs for a single user interaction.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `Rating` component handles the `id` attribute and event propagation. When an `id` is added, it might be causing the component to re-render or trigger the `onChange` event twice due to:

- **Event Bubbling**: The `onChange` event might be bubbling up and being captured twice.
- **State Management**: The internal state of the `Rating` component might be updating twice, causing the `onChange` event to fire twice.
- **Duplicate Event Listeners**: There might be duplicate event listeners attached to the component, leading to the event being triggered twice.
