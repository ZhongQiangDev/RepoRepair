### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `Field` component is not supposed to modify the data it receives. However, the code snippet shows that `this.values` is being set directly from `options.values`, which suggests that any changes to `this.values` could potentially alter the original `options.values` object. This violates the requirement that the `Field` component should not modify the input data.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because `this.values` is assigned a reference to `options.values` rather than a copy of it. As a result, any modifications made to `this.values` will also affect `options.values`, leading to unintended side effects. To prevent this, `this.values` should be initialized with a copy of `options.values` instead of a direct reference.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

```
src/field/index.js
lib/field/index.js
es/field/index.js
es/field/utils.js
lib/validate/rules/required.js
```

- `src/field/index.js`: This file contains the core `Field` class where the problematic assignment occurs. It is the most relevant file as it directly relates to the issue described.
- `lib/field/index.js`: This file likely contains similar logic or utilities related to the `Field` class and may need to be updated to ensure consistency across the codebase.
- `es/field/index.js`: Another implementation of the `Field` class that might also need to be checked and updated to avoid the same issue.
- `es/field/utils.js`: This file contains utility functions that might be used by the `Field` class and could be relevant for ensuring proper handling of values.
- `lib/validate/rules/required.js`: While not directly related to the assignment issue, this file contains validation logic that might be affected by changes in how `Field` handles its values.
