### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `dataIndex` property in the `Table.Column` component does not properly handle string values in the format `'[start, end]'`. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to access properties like `startDate` and `endDate` from an undefined value, as shown in the error message.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be in the `fetchDataByPath` function, which is responsible for fetching data based on the `dataIndex` path. The function attempts to parse the `dataIndex` string and access the corresponding properties in the data object. However, when the `dataIndex` is a string in the format `'[start, end]'`, the function fails to correctly interpret it, leading to an attempt to access properties on an undefined value.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/table/column.jsx
src/table/util.js
src/table/base.jsx
docs/table/adaptor/index.jsx
src/table/expanded/row.jsx
```

- **`src/table/column.jsx`**: This file defines the `Column` class, which is responsible for configuring columns within a table. It includes the `dataIndex` property, which is central to the issue.
- **`src/table/util.js`**: This file contains utility functions for the table component, including the `fetchDataByPath` function that is likely causing the error.
- **`src/table/base.jsx`**: This file contains the `Table` class, which is the main component for rendering data tables. It interacts with the `Column` class and uses the utility functions from `util.js`.
- **`docs/table/adaptor/index.jsx`**: This file contains functions for processing and rendering table data, which may be relevant for understanding how `dataIndex` is used in the context of the table component.
- **`src/table/expanded/row.jsx`**: This file contains the `ExpandedRow` class, which may be involved in rendering rows with expanded content, potentially using the `dataIndex` property.
