### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The issue described is that the `Select` component does not display the `defaultValue` ("jack") when the `dataSource` is empty. The expected behavior is for the `defaultValue` to be shown even if there are no options in the `dataSource`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The problem likely stems from how the `Select` component handles `defaultValue` when the `dataSource` is empty. When there are no options in the `dataSource`, the component may not be rendering the `defaultValue` because it assumes there are no valid options to select. This could be due to a check in the component's logic that prevents rendering the `defaultValue` if the `dataSource` is empty.
