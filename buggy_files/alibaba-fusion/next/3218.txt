### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that some `Select` demo styles are too absolute, affecting other demos. Specifically, the `margin-bottom` styles in the `Select` demos are conflicting with other components, causing layout issues.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue is that the `margin-bottom` styles defined in the `Select` demo files are being applied globally, which affects other components. This is likely due to the styles being defined in a way that they are not scoped to the specific demo and are instead affecting other elements on the page.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

docs/select/demo/combobox-basic.md
docs/select/demo/select-basic.md
src/select/select.jsx
src/select/base.jsx
scripts/build/css-var-temp-file-core.js
```

- `docs/select/demo/combobox-basic.md` and `docs/select/demo/select-basic.md`: These files contain the demo styles that are causing the issue. The `margin-bottom` styles need to be scoped or adjusted to avoid affecting other components.
- `src/select/select.jsx`: This file contains the main `Select` component logic. It may need to be updated to ensure that styles are properly scoped.
- `src/select/base.jsx`: This file contains the base component logic for the `Select` component. It may need to be updated to ensure that styles are properly scoped.
- `scripts/build/css-var-temp-file-core.js`: This file is responsible for generating CSS variables. It may need to be updated to ensure that styles are properly scoped and do not conflict with other components.
