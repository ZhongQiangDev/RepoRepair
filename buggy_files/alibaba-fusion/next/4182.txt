### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that enabling the `v2` prop in the `popupProps` of the `CascaderSelect` component results in an error: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getInstance')`. This indicates that the component is trying to access a property or method on a null object, likely related to the `v2` version of the popup functionality.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error suggests that the `v2` version of the popup is not properly initialized or is missing some necessary components. The `getInstance` method is likely part of the popup's internal logic, and it is failing because the popup instance is not correctly set up when `v2` is enabled. This could be due to missing dependencies, incorrect configuration, or a bug in the `v2` implementation.
