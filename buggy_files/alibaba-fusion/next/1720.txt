1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue described is that when a user types a character (e.g., 'r') and triggers an autocomplete suggestion (e.g., "Recent"), pressing Enter results in the search being performed with the typed character ('r') instead of the selected suggestion ("Recent").

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from how the `Search` component handles the Enter key press event. When the Enter key is pressed, the component should check if a suggestion is selected and use that value for the search instead of the current input value.
   - The issue might be in the event handling logic where the Enter key press is not correctly identifying the selected suggestion.
