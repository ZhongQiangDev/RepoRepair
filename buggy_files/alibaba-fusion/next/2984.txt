### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `CascaderSelect` component is modifying the properties of the object passed to it, which leads to an error when using `immer` (a library for immutable state management). This modification of the passed object is not expected behavior and can cause issues with state management libraries that assume immutability.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error message indicates that the `Cascader` component is trying to add a property to an object that is not extensible. This suggests that the `Cascader` component is directly modifying the props object it receives, which is a common anti-pattern in React. The `Cascader` component should not mutate the props it receives but instead should create new objects or use the props as read-only values.
