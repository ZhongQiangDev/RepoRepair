1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The current implementation automatically adds a `title` attribute to `Menu.Item` components, which causes issues when the `title` content is identical to the `innerText`. This violates the WCAG principle of avoiding redundant text and can also lead to an unwanted hover tooltip for some users.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The `title` attribute is being added to `Menu.Item` components without considering whether the `innerText` is already sufficient. This results in redundant text for screen readers and an unnecessary hover tooltip for users who do not want it. The issue arises from the automatic addition of the `title` attribute without conditional checks.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/menu/view/item.jsx
src/menu/view/menu.jsx
docs/menu/adaptor/index.jsx
src/menu-button/index.jsx
src/menu/view/selectable-item.jsx
```

- `src/menu/view/item.jsx`: This file defines the `Item` class, which is responsible for rendering menu items. It likely contains the logic for adding the `title` attribute and would need to be modified to conditionally add it based on the `innerText`.
- `src/menu/view/menu.jsx`: This file defines the `Menu` class, which manages the overall menu structure. It may contain logic related to the rendering of menu items and could be involved in the issue.
- `docs/menu/adaptor/index.jsx`: This file contains utility functions for creating menu items and could have logic related to the automatic addition of the `title` attribute.
- `src/menu-button/index.jsx`: This file defines the `MenuButton` component, which might also be involved in rendering menu items and could have related logic.
- `src/menu/view/selectable-item.jsx`: This file defines the `SelectableItem` class, which is another type of menu item. It might also contain relevant logic for adding the `title` attribute.
