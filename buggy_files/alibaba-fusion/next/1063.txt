### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The GitHub problem description indicates that the `Field` component is modifying the input data, which is not the intended behavior. The component should not alter the data it receives as input.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the `Field` component directly modifying the `options.values` object. In the provided code snippet, `this.values` is assigned the `options.values` object directly. If `options.values` is an object passed by reference, any modifications to `this.values` will also modify the original `options.values`, leading to the observed behavior.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the files most related to the cause are:

```
src/field/index.js
src/field/utils.js
src/form/enhance.jsx
src/form/form.jsx
src/form/item.jsx
```

- `src/field/index.js`: This file contains the `Field` class where the problematic behavior is likely occurring. The `values` property is being assigned directly from `options.values`, which could lead to the modification of the input data.
- `src/field/utils.js`: This file contains utility functions that might be used by the `Field` class for value management and manipulation. Ensuring these utilities do not modify the input data is crucial.
- `src/form/enhance.jsx`: This file contains functions that handle form field initialization and validation, which could be indirectly affecting the `Field` component's behavior.
- `src/form/form.jsx`: This file contains the `Form` class, which manages form creation and validation. It might be interacting with the `Field` component and could be relevant to the issue.
- `src/form/item.jsx`: This file contains the `Item` class, which serves as a wrapper for form elements. It might be involved in the form field management and could be relevant to the problem.
