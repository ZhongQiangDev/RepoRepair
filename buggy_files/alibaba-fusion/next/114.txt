### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `NumberPicker` component displays an incorrect value after incrementing. Specifically, when the value is `4.02` and the step is `0.01`, clicking the increment button results in the display of `4.029999999999999` instead of the expected `4.03`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises from the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript. When adding `0.01` to `4.02`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary. This leads to a small rounding error, resulting in `4.029999999999999`.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

To address this issue, we need to focus on the `NumberPicker` component and its handling of numerical values. The files most related to this issue are:

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/util/string.js
src/util/object.js
src/util/dom.js
src/util/events.js
```

- **`src/number-picker/index.jsx`**: This is the primary file where the `NumberPicker` component is defined. It handles the increment and decrement logic, so it is crucial for fixing the floating-point issue.
- **`src/util/string.js`**: This file contains utility functions for string manipulation, which might be useful for formatting the number to the correct precision.
- **`src/util/object.js`**: This file contains utility functions for object manipulation, which might be useful for handling the state and props of the `NumberPicker` component.
- **`src/util/dom.js`**: This file contains DOM-related utility functions, which might be relevant if the issue involves rendering or updating the DOM.
- **`src/util/events.js`**: This file contains event-related utility functions, which might be relevant if the issue involves event handling in the `NumberPicker` component.
