### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The issue described in the GitHub problem is that the background color of the `CascaderSelect` component appears abnormal when using virtual scrolling. The image shows that the background color of the dropdown menu is not consistent, with some areas appearing as white while others show a different color.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is likely related to how the virtual scrolling is implemented in the `CascaderSelect` component. Virtual scrolling optimizes performance by rendering only the visible items in the list, but it can sometimes cause rendering issues if the item heights or background colors are not handled correctly. The problem could be due to:
- Incorrect calculation of item heights or positions.
- Background color not being applied consistently to all virtualized items.
- Issues with the virtual list's rendering logic or CSS styles.
