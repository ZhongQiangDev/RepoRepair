### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `NumberPicker` component allows users to input values beyond the specified maximum limit. Even though the component is supposed to restrict the input to a certain maximum value, users can still manually enter larger numbers, which leads to unexpected behavior where the price remains unchanged despite the input value exceeding the limit.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the lack of proper input validation within the `NumberPicker` component. Specifically, the component may not be correctly handling or enforcing the maximum value constraint when the user manually types in a value. The `onBlur` event might be correcting the value, but this correction happens after the user has already entered an invalid value, leading to a confusing user experience.
