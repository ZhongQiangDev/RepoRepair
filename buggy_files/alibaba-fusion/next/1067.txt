### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The issue described is that the left arrow (previous arrow) is disabled when `slidesToShow > slidesCount`, `infinite={false}`, and `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`. This means the user cannot navigate to the previous slide even though there are more slides available.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The problem likely stems from how the slider component determines whether to disable the navigation arrows. When `infinite={false}`, the slider should not loop, and the navigation arrows should be disabled based on the current slide index and the total number of slides. However, if `defaultActiveIndex !== 0`, the logic for disabling the left arrow might be incorrect, preventing navigation to earlier slides.

### 3. Related Files
The files most related to this issue are those that handle the slider's navigation logic, arrow rendering, and state management. Here are the top 5 files ordered by importance:

```
src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx
src/slider/slick/mixins/event-handlers.js
src/slider/slick/mixins/helpers.js
src/slider/index.jsx
src/slider/slick/track.jsx
```

- `src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx`: This file contains the `Arrow` component, which renders the navigation arrows and determines when they should be disabled. It likely contains the logic that needs to be fixed.
- `src/slider/slick/mixins/event-handlers.js`: This file handles various event handlers for the slider, including navigation events. It may contain logic related to disabling arrows based on the slider's state.
- `src/slider/slick/mixins/helpers.js`: This file includes helper functions for managing the slider's state and behavior. It might contain functions that calculate the current slide index and determine if navigation is possible.
- `src/slider/index.jsx`: This file defines the main `Slider` component and manages its overall behavior. It may contain props or state management that affects arrow behavior.
- `src/slider/slick/track.jsx`: This file handles the rendering of the slider track and slides. While less directly related, it may contain logic that interacts with the navigation arrows.
