1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `Upload` component does not support a delete function when using `itemRender`. The image shows that while there is a delete button for the first two upload items, the third item, which uses `itemRender`, lacks a delete button.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to how `itemRender` is implemented in the `Upload` component. When `itemRender` is used, it customizes the rendering of each item, but it may not include the necessary logic or props to handle the delete functionality. This could be due to missing event handlers or props that are not passed down to the rendered items.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/upload/upload.jsx
src/upload/list.jsx
src/upload/index.jsx
src/upload/card.jsx
src/upload/runtime/html5-uploader.jsx
```

- `src/upload/upload.jsx`: This file contains the main `Upload` component, which manages the overall upload functionality. It likely defines the `itemRender` prop and how it interacts with the list of uploaded files.
- `src/upload/list.jsx`: This file contains the `List` component, which is responsible for rendering the list of uploaded files. It may need to be updated to ensure that the delete functionality is included when `itemRender` is used.
- `src/upload/index.jsx`: This file contains utility functions and the main `Upload` component's render logic. It may need adjustments to ensure that the delete functionality is properly passed down when using `itemRender`.
- `src/upload/card.jsx`: This file contains the `Card` component, which is used for rendering uploaded files in a card format. It may need to be updated to include the delete functionality when `itemRender` is used.
- `src/upload/runtime/html5-uploader.jsx`: This file contains the `Html5Uploader` component, which handles the actual file upload process. While it may not directly relate to the delete functionality, it is part of the overall upload system and could be relevant if the issue is related to how files are managed during the upload process.
