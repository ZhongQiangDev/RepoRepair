### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when both disabled items and default selected items are enabled in the `TreeSelect` component, the input box displays duplicate labels upon initialization. This results in a warning about encountering two children with the same key, indicating a problem with key uniqueness in the component's rendering logic.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the `TreeSelect` component handles the rendering of disabled and selected items. Specifically, the problem may be related to how keys are assigned to the rendered items. If the same key is assigned to multiple items, React will issue a warning and may render the items incorrectly. This could happen if the component is not properly managing the keys for disabled and selected items, leading to duplicates.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx
src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx
src/tree/view/util.js
src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx
src/tree/view/tree.jsx
```

- `docs/tree-select/adaptor/index.jsx`: This file contains functions that process and configure the `TreeSelect` component, including data transformation and key handling, which could be related to the key duplication issue.
- `src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx`: This is the main implementation of the `TreeSelect` component, where the rendering logic and key management would be defined.
- `src/tree/view/util.js`: This file contains utility functions for managing hierarchical data, including key normalization and filtering, which could be relevant to the key duplication problem.
- `src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx`: This file defines the `TreeNode` component, which is used to render individual nodes in the tree. Issues with key assignment could originate here.
- `src/tree/view/tree.jsx`: This file contains the `Tree` component, which is responsible for rendering the entire tree structure. It may contain logic that affects how nodes are rendered, including disabled nodes.
