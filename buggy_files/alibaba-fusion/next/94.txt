### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `NumberPicker` component displays an incorrect value when the step is incremented. Specifically, when starting from `4.02` and adding `0.01`, the expected result is `4.03`, but the component displays `4.029999999999999` due to JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic precision issues.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript. When adding `0.01` to `4.02`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary. This leads to a small rounding error, resulting in the display of `4.029999999999999` instead of `4.03`.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

To fix this issue, we need to address how the `NumberPicker` handles and displays floating-point numbers. The most relevant files are:

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/util/object.js
src/validate/rules/format.js
src/validate/rules/length.js
src/validate/rules/size.js
```

- **`src/number-picker/index.jsx`**: This is the primary file where the `NumberPicker` component is defined. It handles the increment and decrement logic, so it is crucial for addressing the precision issue.
- **`src/util/object.js`**: This file contains utility functions that might be used for handling and formatting objects, which could include numeric values. It might have functions that can help in rounding or formatting numbers.
- **`src/validate/rules/format.js`**: This file contains validation rules for different formats, including numbers. It might have functions that can help in validating and formatting the numeric values correctly.
- **`src/validate/rules/length.js`**: This file contains validation rules for length, which might be relevant if the issue involves the length of the number string after formatting.
- **`src/validate/rules/size.js`**: This file contains validation rules for size, which might be relevant if the issue involves the size constraints of the numeric values.
