### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The first issue described involves the `Overlay` component where the date picker popup appears in the wrong position when there are two scrollbars. The second issue involves the `NumberPicker` component where the `innerBefore` style is incorrect and does not support `innerAfter`.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

#### Overlay Issue:
- **Cause**: The overlay positioning logic likely does not account for the presence of multiple scrollbars, leading to incorrect calculations for the popup's position. This could be due to incorrect offset calculations or not considering the scroll position of the container.

#### NumberPicker Issue:
- **Cause**: The `innerBefore` and `innerAfter` styles are not being applied correctly, possibly due to missing or incorrect CSS classes or props handling in the `NumberPicker` component. The component might not be rendering the `innerBefore` and `innerAfter` elements properly.
