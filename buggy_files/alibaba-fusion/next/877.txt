### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The problem described is that the overlay content collapses when the content is inline and there is no space for the browser to render it properly. The suggested fix is to add `width: 100%` to the overlay content to ensure it has enough space.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The issue likely stems from the overlay content not having a defined width, causing it to collapse when the content is inline. This can be due to the CSS not properly setting the width of the overlay content, leading to layout issues when the content is inline.
