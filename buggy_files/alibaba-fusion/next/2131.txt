### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that after upgrading to version 1.20.23, the `Tree` component is throwing an error: `Cannot add property 'pos', object is not extensible`. This error occurs because the code attempts to set the `pos` property on an object that has been made non-extensible, meaning no new properties can be added to it.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error occurs in the `tree.js` file at line 159, where the code tries to assign a value to `item.pos`. The error message indicates that the `item` object is not extensible, which means it has been frozen or sealed at some point in the code, preventing new properties from being added.

This issue likely stems from changes in the newer version of the library that affect how objects are handled, possibly making them non-extensible by default or through some configuration. The `item` object might be coming from a data source or a higher-level component that has been frozen.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/tree/view/tree.js
src/tree/view/tree-node.js
src/tree/view/util.js
src/util/object.js
src/tree/view/tree-node-indent.js
```

- **`src/tree/view/tree.js`**: This is the primary file where the error occurs. It contains the logic for rendering the tree and assigning the `pos` property.
- **`src/tree/view/tree-node.js`**: This file likely defines the `TreeNode` component, which is a key part of the tree structure and may influence how nodes are created and managed.
- **`src/tree/view/util.js`**: This file may contain utility functions used in the tree rendering process, which could affect how objects are handled.
- **`src/util/object.js`**: This file contains utility functions for object manipulation, which might include functions that make objects non-extensible.
- **`src/tree/view/tree-node-indent.js`**: This file may handle indentation logic for tree nodes, which could be related to the structure and properties of tree nodes.
