### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described is that when the `NumberPicker` component is used with a `defaultValue` of `4.02` and a `step` of `0.01`, clicking the `+` button results in the display showing `4.029999999999999` instead of the expected `4.03`. This is due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is the way JavaScript handles floating-point numbers. When adding `0.01` to `4.02`, the result is not exactly `4.03` due to the limitations of binary floating-point representation. This results in a value like `4.029999999999999`, which is then displayed.

### 3. Related Files
To fix this issue, we need to address how the `NumberPicker` handles and displays floating-point numbers. The most relevant files are:

```
src/number-picker/index.jsx
src/util/object.js
src/validate/rules/format.js
src/validate/rules/length.js
src/validate/rules/size.js
```

- **`src/number-picker/index.jsx`**: This is the primary file where the `NumberPicker` component is defined. It needs to be modified to handle the floating-point precision issue, possibly by rounding the result after each operation.
- **`src/util/object.js`**: This file contains utility functions that might be used for value manipulation or validation. It could be relevant if any utility functions are used within the `NumberPicker` for value handling.
- **`src/validate/rules/format.js`**: This file contains validation rules for different formats, including numbers. It might be relevant if the `NumberPicker` uses any of these validation rules.
- **`src/validate/rules/length.js`**: This file contains validation rules for length, which might be relevant if the `NumberPicker` needs to validate the length of the number string after rounding.
- **`src/validate/rules/size.js`**: This file contains validation rules for size, which might be relevant if the `NumberPicker` needs to validate the size of the number after rounding.
