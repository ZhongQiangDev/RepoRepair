### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the Transfer component currently does not support controlling the visibility of the search box independently for the left and right panels. The user wants to be able to show the search box only on the left panel and hide it on the right panel.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The Transfer component likely has a single `showSearch` prop that controls the visibility of the search box for both panels. This means that if `showSearch` is set to `true`, both panels will display the search box, and if it is set to `false`, neither will. To achieve the desired behavior, the component needs to support separate props for controlling the search box visibility for each panel individually.
