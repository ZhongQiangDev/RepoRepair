1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue described is that when using both `fixedHeader` and `resizable` features together in a table, the header filter dropdown displays incorrectly. Specifically, the header appears misaligned or distorted when the filter button is clicked.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from a conflict between the fixed header and resizable column functionalities. When the header is fixed, it may not properly account for the dynamic resizing of columns, leading to misalignment or distortion of the header elements, especially when interacting with filter dropdowns.
   - The issue could be related to how the fixed header's position and dimensions are calculated and maintained during column resizing. The fixed header might not be recalculating its layout correctly after the columns are resized.
