### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when a Call Activity is transformed into an Expanded SubProcess, the visual representation does not resize appropriately. Instead, it retains the appearance of a Task, and the wrench menu only allows changing it to an Event SubProcess, preventing the user from reverting it back to a Call Activity.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the following:

- **Incorrect Visual Representation**: The transformation from Call Activity to Expanded SubProcess does not update the visual properties (e.g., shape, size) correctly.
- **Menu Options Mismatch**: The wrench menu options do not reflect the current state of the element, preventing the user from reverting the element back to a Call Activity.
- **State Management**: The internal state of the element might not be updated correctly when the transformation occurs, leading to the incorrect menu options being displayed.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
```

### Explanation:

1. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`**: This file manages the replacement of elements within a BPMN diagram. The issue might be related to how the Call Activity is replaced with an Expanded SubProcess and whether the visual properties are updated correctly.

2. **`lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`**: This file handles updates to BPMN elements, including updating properties and bounds. It might be responsible for ensuring that the visual representation of the element is updated correctly when the transformation occurs.

3. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`**: This file manages the collapse and expansion of BPMN sub-process elements. The issue might be related to how the element's state is managed when it is toggled between collapsed and expanded states.

4. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js`**: This file manages the lifecycle of `bpmndi:BPMNPlane` elements associated with collapsed subprocesses. It might be involved in ensuring that the visual representation of the element is updated correctly when it is transformed into an Expanded SubProcess.

5. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`**: This file manages the resizing behavior of BPMN elements. The issue might be related to how the element is resized when it is transformed into an Expanded SubProcess, ensuring that it visually appears as an Expanded SubProcess rather than a Task.
