### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that a typed start event can be pasted onto a subprocess, which should not be allowed according to BPMN rules. Additionally, non-interrupting events can be copied out of an event subprocess and pasted elsewhere, which is also not allowed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the copy-paste functionality not properly enforcing BPMN rules when pasting elements onto a subprocess. Specifically, the rules that prevent certain types of events from being placed in specific contexts (like subprocesses) are not being checked or enforced during the paste operation.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to this issue are those that handle copy-paste operations, BPMN rules enforcement, and event handling within subprocesses. Here are the top 5 files ordered by importance:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
```

- `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`: This file manages the copying and pasting of BPMN elements. It needs to be modified to ensure that pasting a typed start event onto a subprocess is not allowed.
- `lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js`: This file contains the BPMN-specific rules that should be enforced. It likely needs to be updated to include rules that prevent certain events from being placed in subprocesses.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`: This file handles the replacement of elements, which may be relevant if the paste operation involves replacing an existing element.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js`: This file manages the behavior of start events within subprocesses. It may need to be updated to prevent typed start events from being added to subprocesses.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js`: This file manages the behavior of attaching events. It may need to be updated to prevent non-interrupting events from being attached to subprocesses.
