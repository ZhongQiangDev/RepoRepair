### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when an Intermediate Event is copied and pasted as a Boundary Event, it loses its properties such as Async Continuations and Job Configurations.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how properties are copied and pasted between different types of events. Specifically, when an Intermediate Event is pasted as a Boundary Event, the properties may not be correctly transferred due to differences in how these event types handle their properties. This could be related to how the `copyProperties` function handles the transfer of properties or how the `BpmnCopyPaste` function manages the copying and pasting process.

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js

lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js
lib/util/DiUtil.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`: This file is directly responsible for managing the copy and paste functionality of BPMN elements. It likely contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to ensure properties are correctly transferred when pasting an Intermediate Event as a Boundary Event.

- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js`: This file handles the behavior when a boundary event is created. It may need to be modified to ensure that properties from the copied intermediate event are correctly applied to the new boundary event.

- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js`: This file manages the behavior of attaching events in a BPMN diagram. It might need adjustments to ensure that properties are retained when an intermediate event is attached as a boundary event.

- `lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js`: This file handles property updates in BPMN elements. It might need to be checked to ensure that properties are correctly updated when an intermediate event is pasted as a boundary event.

- `lib/util/DiUtil.js`: This utility file contains functions for checking and handling BPMN elements. It might be relevant for ensuring that the correct properties are identified and transferred during the copy-paste process.
