### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that the snapping functionality for docking points between connected elements is missing in version `v4-beta` compared to `v3.x`. In `v3.x`, when an element is moved, it snaps to the docking points of other connected elements, ensuring precise alignment. However, in `v4-beta`, this snapping behavior is no longer present, leading to misalignment when moving elements.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from changes in the snapping mechanism or the rules governing how elements should snap to each other. This could involve modifications in the snapping utilities, the rules engine, or the event handling for element movement. The absence of snapping suggests that the logic responsible for detecting and applying docking points during element movement has either been altered or removed.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the snapping behavior and should be examined to fix the issue:

```
lib/features/snapping/BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js
lib/features/snapping/BpmnSnappingUtil.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ImportDockingFix.js
```

These files are ordered by their potential impact on the snapping behavior:

- `BpmnCreateMoveSnapping.js`: Likely contains the core logic for snapping during element creation and movement.
- `BpmnSnappingUtil.js`: Provides utility functions that may be used for calculating and enforcing snapping constraints.
- `BpmnRules.js`: Contains rules that could affect how elements interact and snap to each other.
- `DropOnFlowBehavior.js`: Manages behavior when elements are dropped onto flows, which may involve snapping.
- `ImportDockingFix.js`: Addresses docking issues after import, which could be related to snapping behavior.
