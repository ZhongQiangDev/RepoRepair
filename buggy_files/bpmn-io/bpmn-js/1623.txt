### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the deep linking overlay for the subprocess is lost when navigating between multiple processes and subprocesses within the same BPMN diagram. This indicates an issue with maintaining the deep linking state when transitioning between different levels of the diagram.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause likely stems from how the deep linking and multi-diagram navigation functionalities interact. Specifically, the deep linking overlay might not be properly preserved or updated when the user navigates between different subprocesses or global subprocesses. This could be due to a lack of synchronization between the navigation logic and the deep linking overlay management.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue, ordered by their importance:

```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleCollapseConnectionBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeLaneBehavior.js
```

- `lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js`: This file manages the drilldown overlays on shapes, which is directly related to the deep linking overlay issue.
- `lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js`: This file handles the navigation between different levels of subprocesses using breadcrumbs, which is crucial for maintaining the deep linking state.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js`: This file manages the lifecycle of BPMN planes associated with collapsed subprocesses, which could affect how deep linking is handled during navigation.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleCollapseConnectionBehaviour.js`: This file manages the behavior of connections when a shape is collapsed, which might impact the deep linking overlay when transitioning between expanded and collapsed states.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeLaneBehavior.js`: This file manages the resizing of lanes, which could indirectly affect the layout and positioning of deep linking overlays if not properly synchronized with navigation.
