### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a connected shape (like a Sub-Process) is resized, the labels and associations connected to it do not move along with the shape. Instead, they remain in their original positions, causing them to appear disconnected or "hanging."

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the logic responsible for updating the positions of labels and associations after a shape is resized is not functioning correctly. This could be due to a few potential causes:

- The function responsible for updating the waypoints of connections and labels during a resize operation might not be properly triggered or implemented.
- The logic for recalculating the positions of labels and associations based on the new shape dimensions might be missing or incorrect.
- There could be a problem with event listeners that should trigger the update of labels and associations when a shape is resized.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue, ordered by importance:

```

- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`: This file manages the resize behavior of BPMN elements. It likely contains the logic that should trigger the update of labels and associations when a shape is resized.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`: This file manages the lifecycle of labels associated with BPMN elements. It likely contains the logic for positioning and updating labels.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AssociationBehavior.js`: This file manages the movement of shapes and their associated BPMN connections. It likely contains the logic for updating associations when shapes are moved or resized.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LayoutConnectionBehavior.js`: This file ensures that associations connected to connections remain consistent when those connections undergo layout changes. It might be relevant for ensuring that labels and associations are updated correctly.
- `lib/features/modeling/util/ConnectionLayoutUtil.js`: This file contains utility functions for adjusting the positions of labels or points associated with connections when the waypoints of those connections change. It might be relevant for ensuring that labels and associations are repositioned correctly.
