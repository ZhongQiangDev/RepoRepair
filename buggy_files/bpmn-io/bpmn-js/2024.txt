### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves the incorrect rendering of pool and lane labels in vertical collaboration diagrams. Specifically, the labels are not being positioned correctly when the pool is marked as vertical (`isHorizontal="false"`), leading to misalignment and improper display.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the rendering logic not accounting for the vertical orientation of pools and lanes. The rendering code may be assuming a horizontal orientation by default, and it does not adjust the label positioning or orientation based on the `isHorizontal` property in the BPMN XML.

```

### Explanation:

1. **`lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js`**: This file is responsible for rendering BPMN elements, including shapes and labels. It likely contains the core logic for positioning labels, which needs to be adjusted to handle vertical pools correctly.

2. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`**: This file manages the lifecycle of labels associated with BPMN elements. It ensures proper positioning and alignment of labels during various operations. Adjustments here may be necessary to handle vertical orientation.

3. **`lib/util/LabelUtil.js`**: This utility file contains functions for calculating label positions and determining if labels are external. It may need modifications to correctly calculate positions for vertical pools.

4. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js`**: This file handles the positioning of external labels in a diagram. It may need to be updated to consider the vertical orientation of pools when calculating optimal label positions.

5. **`lib/import/BpmnImporter.js`**: This file is responsible for importing BPMN diagrams and rendering elements based on the XML. It may need to ensure that the `isHorizontal` property is correctly interpreted and passed to the rendering logic.
