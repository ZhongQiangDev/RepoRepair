1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when a `call activity` is morphed into an `expanded subprocess`, the resulting subprocess does not automatically include a start event, unlike when a `task` is morphed into an `expanded subprocess`.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The morphing behavior for `call activity` to `expanded subprocess` does not trigger the same logic that adds a start event as it does for `task` to `expanded subprocess`. This suggests that the morphing logic for `call activity` is missing the step that checks if a start event should be added.

- `SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js`: This file is directly related to adding a start event to an expanded subprocess, which is the core issue described.
- `BpmnReplace.js`: This file handles the replacement of BPMN elements, which is relevant to the morphing behavior.
- `ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`: This file manages the collapse and expansion of BPMN sub-process elements, which could be involved in the morphing process.
- `BpmnUpdater.js`: This file manages updates to the BPMN diagram, including connection cropping and parent updates, which might be relevant to ensuring the correct structure after morphing.
- `CreateBehavior.js`: This file intercepts and modifies the creation process of shapes, which could be relevant to ensuring the correct behavior when creating or morphing elements.
