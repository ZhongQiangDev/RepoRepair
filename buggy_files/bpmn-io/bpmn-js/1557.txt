### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves an error being thrown when attempting to morph a `DataStoreReference` to a `DataObjectReference` outside of a Pool. The error occurs because the system tries to update the `di` parent of the element, but it fails due to the element being outside of a Pool, leading to an undefined property access.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the error is likely related to the BPMN modeling rules and the specific behavior of the `BpmnUpdater` when updating the `di` parent of an element. When the `DataStoreReference` is outside of a Pool, the `updateDiParent` method in `BpmnUpdater.js` may not handle this case correctly, leading to an attempt to access an undefined property. This suggests that the method does not properly account for elements that are not within a Pool.

### Explanation:

1. **`lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`**: This file contains the `updateDiParent` method, which is directly involved in updating the `di` parent of elements. The error likely originates from this method when it tries to access an undefined property for elements outside of a Pool.

2. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`**: This file manages the replacement of elements, including the morphing behavior. It may need to be adjusted to handle the specific case of morphing elements outside of a Pool.

3. **`lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js`**: This file contains the core modeling functionality, including the `replaceElements` method, which is responsible for replacing elements in the diagram. It may need to be modified to ensure that the replacement process correctly handles elements outside of a Pool.

4. **`lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdateFlowNodeRefsHandler.js`**: This file handles updates to flow node references, which may be affected when morphing elements. Ensuring that flow node references are correctly updated can help prevent errors when morphing elements outside of a Pool.

5. **`lib/features/modeling/util/ModelingUtil.js`**: This file contains utility functions that may be used in the morphing process. Ensuring that these utilities correctly handle elements outside of a Pool can help prevent errors.
