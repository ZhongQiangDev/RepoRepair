### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the direct editing box remains open even after switching planes in the BPMN diagram. This is unexpected because the direct editing box should close when the element it is associated with is no longer visible.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the direct editing functionality does not properly detect or respond to plane switches. When a plane switch occurs, the direct editing box should be closed if the element it is associated with is no longer visible. This suggests that the event handling for plane switches is not properly integrated with the direct editing functionality.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
```

- **`LabelEditingProvider.js`**: This file manages the direct editing of labels for BPMN elements. It is likely where the direct editing box is created and managed, and where the issue might need to be addressed.
- **`DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js`**: This file handles the navigation between different planes in the BPMN diagram. It might need to notify the direct editing functionality when a plane switch occurs.
- **`DrilldownCentering.js`**: This file manages the view state when drilling down into subprocesses. It might also be involved in handling plane switches and could be relevant to the issue.
- **`ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`**: This file manages the collapse and expansion of BPMN sub-process elements. While not directly related to plane switching, it might have similar event handling that could provide insights.
- **`LabelUtil.js`**: This file contains utility functions for handling labels, which might be useful for managing the direct editing box's behavior.
