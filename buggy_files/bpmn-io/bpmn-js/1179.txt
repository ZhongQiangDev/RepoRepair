### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a new element is dropped onto a sequence flow, the layout of the diagram breaks. Specifically, the new incoming sequence flow is docked at the top left corner of the target element instead of being properly aligned with the existing sequence flow.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the new element's position is calculated and applied when it is dropped onto the sequence flow. The docking logic may not be correctly accounting for the existing sequence flow's position and orientation, causing the new element to default to the top left corner.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/auto-place/AutoPlace.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnLayouter.js
lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js
```

- **`AutoPlace.js`**: This file is responsible for automating the placement of new shapes in the diagram. The issue might be related to how the new element's position is determined relative to the existing sequence flow.
- **`DropOnFlowBehavior.js`**: This file manages the behavior when elements are dropped onto flows. It likely contains the logic for calculating the new element's position and docking it onto the sequence flow.
- **`ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js`**: This file ensures that connections adhere to BPMN rules. It might be relevant if the new element's connection needs to be validated or adjusted.
- **`BpmnLayouter.js`**: This file contains functions for layouting BPMN connections. It might be involved in ensuring that the new sequence flow is properly aligned with the existing layout.
- **`BpmnConnectSnapping.js`**: This file manages snapping behavior when connecting elements. It might be relevant for ensuring that the new element is snapped to the correct position on the sequence flow.
