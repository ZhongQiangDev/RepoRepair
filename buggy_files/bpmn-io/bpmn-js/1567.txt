### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when a user tries to drill out of a sub-process after wrapping it in a pool and moving into it, an error is thrown: `Uncaught Error: rootElement required`. This indicates that the drilldown overlay is not aware of the root element changes, preventing the user from moving back up to the parent process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error suggests that the `Canvas` component is not being updated correctly with the new root element when the user drills into a sub-process. The `DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js` and related files responsible for managing the drilldown navigation and root element changes are likely not properly updating the `Canvas` with the new root element. This could be due to a missing event listener or an incorrect handling of the root element change event.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js
lib/features/drilldown/SubprocessCompatibility.js
lib/util/DrilldownUtil.js
lib/core/Canvas.js
```

- `DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js`: This file manages the breadcrumb navigation system, which is directly involved in the drilldown and drillout functionality. It needs to be updated to handle root element changes correctly.
- `DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js`: This file manages the drilldown overlay behavior, including adding and removing overlays. It may need to be updated to ensure the overlay is aware of root element changes.
- `SubprocessCompatibility.js`: This file handles subprocess compatibility during diagram import and manipulation. It may need to be updated to ensure subprocesses are correctly managed during root element changes.
- `DrilldownUtil.js`: This file contains utility functions for drilldown operations, which may need to be updated to ensure proper handling of root element changes.
- `Canvas.js`: This file manages the canvas and its root element. It may need to be updated to ensure it is correctly updated with the new root element during drilldown and drillout operations.
