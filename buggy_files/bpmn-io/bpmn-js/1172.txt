### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that associations on `bpmn:BoundaryEvents` are not rendered correctly after the BPMN diagram is exported and re-imported. Specifically, the association between the boundary event and the data object is lost during the import process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the associations are stored and then reloaded during the import process. The association information might not be properly serialized when exporting the BPMN diagram or not correctly deserialized when importing it. This could be due to missing or incorrect handling of the association elements in the BPMN XML or in the code that processes the XML.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue:

```
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/BoundaryEventBehavior.js
lib/import/BpmnTreeWalker.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
```

- `lib/import/BpmnImporter.js`: This file is responsible for importing the BPMN diagram and could be where the association information is not being correctly handled.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js`: This file handles the creation of boundary events and might be involved in how associations are initially set up.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/BoundaryEventBehavior.js`: This file contains behavior related to boundary events and could be involved in maintaining associations.
- `lib/import/BpmnTreeWalker.js`: This file is used for traversing the BPMN XML tree and could be where the association information is not being correctly processed.
- `lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`: This file updates the BPMN model and could be involved in ensuring that associations are maintained during updates.
