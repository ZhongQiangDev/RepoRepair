### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that typed start events are allowed inside non-event-based sub-processes, which should not be permitted. The goal is to disallow the morphing of start events to typed events within sub-processes and to drop the event type when moving a start event into a sub-process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely stems from the BPMN modeling rules not being enforced correctly when creating or moving start events within sub-processes. Specifically, the rules that govern the types of events allowed within sub-processes are not being applied properly. This could be due to a lack of validation in the event creation or movement logic, or an issue with the rules engine that manages BPMN element types.

**Explanation:**

- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js`: This file is directly related to the behavior of start events within sub-processes. It likely contains the logic for adding start events to sub-processes and ensuring they are correctly handled.

- `lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js`: This file contains the BPMN modeling rules that determine what types of elements can be created or moved within a BPMN diagram. It is crucial for enforcing the rule that typed start events should not be allowed inside non-event-based sub-processes.

- `lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`: This file manages updates to BPMN elements, including the creation and modification of start events. It may need to be updated to ensure that typed start events are not allowed within sub-processes.

- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBehavior.js`: This file handles the creation of BPMN elements, including start events. It may need to be modified to prevent the creation of typed start events within sub-processes.

- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`: This file manages the replacement of elements within a BPMN diagram. It may need to be updated to ensure that when a start event is moved into a sub-process, its type is dropped.
