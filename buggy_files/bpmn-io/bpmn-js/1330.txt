### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that it is possible to connect a message flow to a boundary event, which should not be allowed according to BPMN semantics. The connection should be disallowed when attempting to connect a participant (`B`) to a boundary event.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the rules governing the connection of elements within the BPMN diagram. Specifically, the rules for message flows and boundary events may not be correctly enforced, allowing connections that should be forbidden. This could be due to a lack of validation in the connection creation process or incorrect handling of boundary events as valid targets for message flows.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js
lib/features/context-pad/ContextPadProvider.js
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
```

- `lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js`: This file contains the rules that determine whether connections can be made between elements. It likely needs to be updated to include a rule that disallows message flows from connecting to boundary events.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBehavior.js`: This file manages the creation of shapes and connections. It may need to be modified to prevent the creation of connections that violate BPMN rules.
- `lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js`: This file provides methods for manipulating the BPMN diagram. It may need to be updated to ensure that connections are validated against BPMN rules before being created.
- `lib/features/context-pad/ContextPadProvider.js`: This file manages the context pad, which provides actions for elements. It may need to be updated to remove the option to connect message flows to boundary events from the context pad.
- `lib/import/BpmnImporter.js`: This file handles the import of BPMN diagrams. It may need to be updated to ensure that imported diagrams do not contain invalid connections.
