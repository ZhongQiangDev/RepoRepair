### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is added to a non-default sequence flow of an Exclusive Gateway, the `default` attribute on the gateway is removed. This results in the default flow being lost, even though it is still visually rendered.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the BPMN modeler handles the addition of intermediate events to sequence flows. When an intermediate event is added, the modeler may be incorrectly updating the gateway's properties, specifically removing the `default` attribute. This could be due to a flaw in the event handling or property update logic within the modeling behavior.
