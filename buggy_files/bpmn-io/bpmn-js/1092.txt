### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that users cannot easily connect two tasks center-to-center in a BPMN diagram after the introduction of connection previews and grid snapping. The connection process is hindered, and the interaction results in a less intuitive experience compared to the previous version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the new features of connection previews and grid snapping. These features may be interfering with the center-to-center snapping mechanism, causing the connection process to deviate from the expected behavior. Specifically, the grid snapping might be prioritizing grid alignment over center-to-center alignment, or the connection previews might be misleading the user into making incorrect connections.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js

lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AppendBehavior.js
```

- `lib/features/grid-snapping/BpmnGridSnapping.js`: This file manages grid snapping behavior, which could be interfering with center-to-center snapping.
- `lib/features/connect/Connect.js`: This file likely contains the core logic for connecting elements, which may need adjustments to accommodate the new snapping behavior.
- `lib/features/snapping/BpmnConnectSnapping.js`: This file is directly related to snapping behavior during connections and may need modifications to prioritize center-to-center snapping.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js`: This file handles behavior when shapes are dropped onto flows, which could be relevant if the issue involves dropping one task onto another.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/AppendBehavior.js`: This file manages the positioning of appended shapes, which might be relevant if the issue involves appending one task to another.
