### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when a Pool is copied and pasted, it results in duplicate Pool IDs. This causes issues when exporting and importing the BPMN diagram, as the duplicate IDs lead to errors during the import process.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue likely lies in the way IDs are generated and managed during the copy-paste operation. When a Pool is copied, the ID generation mechanism might not be correctly assigning a new unique ID to the copied Pool, resulting in a duplicate ID. This could be due to a flaw in the ID management logic or the copy-paste functionality not properly handling the ID assignment.

### Step 3: Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js
lib/util/ModelUtil.js
lib/import/BpmnImporter.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
```

1. **`lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`**: This file is directly responsible for the copy-paste functionality. It likely contains the logic for copying and pasting elements, including the assignment of IDs. If the ID assignment logic is flawed, this file would need to be modified.

2. **`lib/features/modeling/BpmnFactory.js`**: This file is responsible for creating BPMN elements and ensuring they have unique IDs. If the ID generation logic is not correctly implemented, this file might need to be adjusted to ensure unique IDs are assigned during the copy-paste operation.

3. **`lib/util/ModelUtil.js`**: This file contains utility functions for working with BPMN elements, including functions for retrieving business objects and checking element types. It might be involved in the ID management process and could need adjustments to ensure proper ID handling.

4. **`lib/import/BpmnImporter.js`**: This file handles the import of BPMN diagrams. If the issue is related to the import process failing due to duplicate IDs, this file might need to be modified to handle such cases more gracefully.

5. **`lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`**: This file manages updates to the BPMN diagram, including updates to element IDs. If the ID management logic needs to be updated to handle copy-paste operations, this file might also need to be modified.
