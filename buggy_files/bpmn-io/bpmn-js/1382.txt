1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `DataObjectReference` replace menu only contains the collection marker, making it feel empty and out of place. The desired behavior is to allow switching between `DataObjectReference` and `DataStoreReference` within the replace menu.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The current implementation of the replace menu for `DataObjectReference` does not include options for switching to `DataStoreReference` or vice versa. This limitation is likely due to the way the replace menu entries are generated and the rules that determine which options are available for a given element type.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
