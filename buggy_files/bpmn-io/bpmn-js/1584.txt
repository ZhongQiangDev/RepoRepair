### Analysis of the Wrong Behavior

The GitHub problem description highlights two main issues:

1. **Inconsistent Redo Behavior for the First Participant**: When the first participant is added, removed, and then re-added, the process ID changes. This indicates a problem with how the ID is managed during undo/redo operations.
2. **Duplicate Pool ID When Copying a Pool**: When a pool with a task inside is copied and pasted, the resulting XML contains duplicate IDs for the process, leading to an invalid BPMN model.

### Cause of the Wrong Behavior

1. **Inconsistent Redo Behavior**:
   - The issue likely stems from how the `Modeler` class manages the creation and destruction of elements, particularly the first participant. The `_collectIds` method might not be correctly resetting or reusing the original ID when the participant is re-added.
   - The `BaseModeler` class's `_collectIds` method could be failing to properly handle the ID registry during the undo/redo cycle.

2. **Duplicate Pool ID**:
   - The `BpmnCopyPaste` function might not be correctly generating unique IDs for the copied elements, leading to duplicate IDs in the XML.
   - The `ModdleCopy` function, which handles property copying, might not be ensuring that IDs are unique across the entire model.
