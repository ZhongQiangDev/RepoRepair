### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that boundary events cannot be copied, even though detaching boundary events is now possible. This is due to a rule in the BPMN model that prevents copying boundary events.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is the `element.copy` rule in the `BpmnRules.js` file, which explicitly prevents boundary events from being copied. This rule is likely in place to enforce certain BPMN modeling constraints, but it now conflicts with the new capability of detaching boundary events.

**Explanation:**

1. **`lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js`**: This file contains the `canCopy` rule that prevents boundary events from being copied. Modifying this rule is essential to allow copying of boundary events.

2. **`lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`**: This file manages the copying and pasting of BPMN elements. It needs to be updated to handle the copying of boundary events correctly.

3. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateBoundaryEventBehavior.js`**: This file handles the creation of boundary events. It may need adjustments to ensure that copied boundary events are created correctly.

4. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js`**: This file manages the detachment of boundary events. Since detaching is now possible, it may need to be integrated with the copying functionality.

5. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`**: This file handles the replacement of elements, which may be relevant when copying boundary events that need to be attached to new hosts.
