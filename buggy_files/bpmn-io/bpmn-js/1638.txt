### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when the label of a Task is removed, the `di.label` property still exists with a value of `null`. This causes issues with other tools, such as linting, because the property should not exist at all if the label is removed.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the way labels are managed and removed in the BPMN diagram. When a label is removed, the system should not only set the label's value to `null` but also completely remove the `di.label` property from the element's definition. The current implementation seems to only set the value to `null` without deleting the property, leading to the observed behavior.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

### Explanation:

- **`lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js`**: This file is responsible for managing the direct editing of labels for BPMN elements. It likely contains the logic for updating and removing labels, which is directly related to the issue.

- **`lib/features/modeling/cmd/UpdatePropertiesHandler.js`**: This file handles property updates for BPMN elements. It includes functions for setting and reverting properties, which could be involved in the process of removing a label and ensuring the `di.label` property is deleted.

- **`lib/util/LabelUtil.js`**: This file contains utility functions for handling labels, including checking if a label is external and calculating label positions. It may contain logic related to managing label properties.

- **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`**: This file manages the lifecycle of labels associated with BPMN elements. It handles label creation, updates, and deletion, which are relevant to the issue.

- **`lib/util/DiUtil.js`**: This file contains utility functions for working with Diagram Interchange (DI) elements. It may include functions for managing and deleting properties related to labels in the DI layer.
