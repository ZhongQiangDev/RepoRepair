### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the dimensions of an Ad Hoc Subprocess changing unexpectedly when it is collapsed and then turned into an Ad Hoc Subprocess. The dimensions should remain consistent with the original expanded Subprocess.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the dimensions of the Subprocess are calculated and maintained during the collapse and transformation into an Ad Hoc Subprocess. The collapse operation might not be preserving the original dimensions correctly, leading to a change in size when the Ad Hoc transformation occurs. This could be due to incorrect handling of the bounding box or the resizing logic for collapsed elements.

**Explanation:**

- **`ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`**: This file manages the collapse and expansion of BPMN sub-process elements. It is likely where the issue originates, as it handles the resizing and state management of sub-processes during collapse.

- **`ResizeBehavior.js`**: This file enforces minimum size constraints and specific resize rules for BPMN elements. It may be involved in incorrectly applying resize rules when the sub-process is collapsed or transformed into an Ad Hoc Subprocess.

- **`BpmnUpdater.js`**: This file manages updates to the BPMN diagram, including connection cropping, parent and root updates, and bounds updates. It ensures the diagram's integrity and may be responsible for maintaining the correct dimensions during transformations.

- **`AdaptiveLabelPositioningBehavior.js`**: This file manages the positioning of external labels in a diagram. While not directly related to dimensions, it could be indirectly involved if label positioning affects the overall layout and dimensions of the sub-process.

- **`ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`**: This file manages the replacement and transformation of elements within a BPMN diagram. It ensures that elements are correctly replaced and updated, which may include handling the transformation into an Ad Hoc Subprocess.
