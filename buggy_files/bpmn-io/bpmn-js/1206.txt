### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when multiple Boundary Events are moved out of their host element in a batch operation, they are not converted to Intermediate Events as expected. Instead, they remain as Boundary Events, which is incorrect according to BPMN standards.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the fact that the logic responsible for converting Boundary Events to Intermediate Events when they are moved out of their host is not being triggered during a batch move operation. This could be due to the event handling or the command interception not properly detecting or processing the batch move scenario.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js
```

- **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/DetachEventBehavior.js`**: This file is responsible for managing the behavior of events when they are detached from their associated shapes. It likely contains the logic for converting Boundary Events to Intermediate Events when they are detached.

- **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceElementBehaviour.js`**: This file handles the replacement of elements in the BPMN diagram. It might be involved in the process of converting Boundary Events to Intermediate Events when they are moved out of their host.

- **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/AttachEventBehavior.js`**: This file manages the behavior of attaching events in the BPMN diagram. It could be relevant if the issue involves the event attachment logic not being properly handled during a batch move.

- **`lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`**: This file ensures the synchronization between the visual and semantic representations of the BPMN diagram. It might be involved in updating the model when Boundary Events are moved out of their host.

- **`lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js`**: This file contains rules for validating BPMN diagram operations. It might define the rules for when Boundary Events should be converted to Intermediate Events, which could be relevant to the issue.
