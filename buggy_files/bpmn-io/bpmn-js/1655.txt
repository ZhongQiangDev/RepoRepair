### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior is that when the `setColor` API is used to change the color of elements with external labels, the external labels are set to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color. This results in the external labels appearing too light, which is a UX concern.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `setColor` API is implemented. Specifically, it seems that the API is not correctly distinguishing between the "fill" and "stroke" properties when applied to external labels. The logic responsible for setting the color of the external labels is probably defaulting to the "fill" color instead of the "stroke" color, which is the expected behavior for consistency with embedded labels.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/modeling/cmd/SetColorHandler.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/draw/TextRenderer.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
```

- `lib/features/modeling/cmd/SetColorHandler.js`: This file is directly responsible for handling the `setColor` API and applying color changes to elements. It is likely where the issue lies in terms of how it applies colors to external labels.
- `lib/util/LabelUtil.js`: This file contains utility functions related to labels, including determining if a label is external. It may need to be updated to ensure that the correct color property is applied.
- `lib/features/modeling/LabelEditingProvider.js`: This file manages the direct editing of labels and could be involved in how the color properties are applied during editing.
- `lib/draw/TextRenderer.js`: This file handles text rendering, including external labels. It may need adjustments to ensure that the stroke color is used correctly.
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`: This file manages the lifecycle of labels and could be involved in ensuring that the correct color properties are applied during label updates.
