### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when an element is deleted while direct editing is active, an `illegal invocation` exception occurs. This exception is triggered during the `execute` or `revert` phase of the `element.updateLabel` action.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of the issue appears to be related to the timing and state management of the label editing process. When an element is deleted while direct editing is active, the system attempts to execute or revert an action (`element.updateLabel`) that is no longer valid because the element has been removed. This results in an `illegal invocation` exception.
