### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the editor crashing with a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'segmentIndex')` when attempting to insert a gateway onto a flow in the BPMN diagram. This error occurs during the process of adding a new gateway shape, specifically when the editor tries to layout the connection between the new gateway and the existing flow.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error message suggests that the code is trying to access a property `segmentIndex` on an undefined object. This likely happens when the editor attempts to calculate or update the layout of the connection lines after inserting the gateway. The undefined object could be a missing or improperly initialized connection or segment in the diagram's data structure.
