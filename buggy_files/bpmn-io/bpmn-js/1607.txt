### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves creating a group inside a collapsed sub-process and then saving the diagram. Upon re-importing the diagram, an "unresolved reference" warning appears, indicating that the group's category value is not being properly handled during the BPMN export and re-import process.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the BPMN exporter handles groups within collapsed sub-processes. When a group is added inside a collapsed sub-process, the exporter may not correctly serialize the group's category value, leading to an unresolved reference upon re-import. This could be due to improper ID management or serialization of the group's properties within the sub-process context.

**Explanation:**

- **GroupBehavior.js**: This file manages the lifecycle of BPMN group elements, including their creation and deletion. It likely contains logic related to how groups are handled within sub-processes, which could be relevant to the issue.

- **BpmnUpdater.js**: This file is responsible for updating BPMN elements and their properties. It may contain code that handles the serialization and deserialization of group properties, including category values, which could be causing the unresolved reference issue.

- **BpmnImporter.js**: This file handles the import of BPMN diagrams and elements. It may be responsible for resolving references during the import process, and any issues with group category values could be addressed here.

- **ModelUtil.js**: This utility file contains functions for working with BPMN elements, including retrieving business objects and checking element types. It may be involved in the proper handling of group elements within sub-processes.

- **SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js**: This file manages the behavior of sub-process planes, including how elements within them are handled. It could contain relevant logic for ensuring that groups within collapsed sub-processes are properly managed during export and import.
