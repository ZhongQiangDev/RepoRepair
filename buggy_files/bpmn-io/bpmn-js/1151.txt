### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when users copy and paste the contents of a participant in a BPMN diagram, the labels associated with the elements (e.g., "A" and "B" in the video) are not preserved. After pasting, the diagram appears without the labels, which should ideally be included along with the elements.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the copy-paste functionality handles the BPMN elements and their associated labels. Specifically, the process of copying the elements might not be capturing the label information correctly, or the pasting process might not be restoring the labels as expected. This could be due to:

- The copy operation not including the label properties in the copied data.
- The paste operation not properly reattaching the labels to the corresponding elements.
- A mismatch in how labels are referenced or stored in the BPMN model during the copy-paste process.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue, ordered by their importance:

```
lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/features/modeling/LabelBehavior.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js
```

- `lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`: This file is directly responsible for managing the copy-paste functionality of BPMN elements. It likely needs to be modified to ensure that labels are correctly included in the copied data and properly restored during the paste operation.
  
- `lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js`: This file manages the direct editing of labels for BPMN elements. It may need to be checked to ensure that label properties are correctly maintained during the copy-paste process.

- `lib/features/modeling/LabelBehavior.js`: This file manages the lifecycle of labels associated with BPMN elements. It could be relevant for ensuring that labels are correctly reattached to elements after pasting.

- `lib/util/LabelUtil.js`: This file contains utility functions for handling labels in BPMN diagrams. It may provide necessary functions for calculating label positions and ensuring they are correctly associated with elements.

- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`: This file also manages label behavior within the modeling environment. It might be relevant for ensuring that labels are correctly handled during the copy-paste process.
