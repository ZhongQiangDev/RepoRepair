### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior is that an empty pool in the BPMN diagram is being resized vertically when the space tool is used. According to the expected behavior, the empty pool should not be resized.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the space tool not correctly identifying or handling the empty pool as a fixed-height shape. The space tool may be applying resizing logic that is intended for other elements, such as lanes or expanded pools, which can be resized. This could be due to a lack of specific rules or checks in the space tool's resizing logic to prevent resizing of empty pools.

lib/features/modeling/util/LaneUtil.js
lib/features/replace/ReplaceOptions.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `lib/features/space-tool/BpmnSpaceTool.js`: This file is directly responsible for the space tool's behavior. It likely contains the logic that needs to be modified to prevent resizing of empty pools.
  
- `lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`: This file manages resize constraints and rules for various BPMN elements. It may need adjustments to include specific rules for empty pools.

- `lib/features/modeling/cmd/ResizeLaneHandler.js`: This file handles the resizing of lanes. Although it is specific to lanes, it might have logic that is inadvertently applied to empty pools, and it could need modifications to exclude empty pools from resizing.

- `lib/features/modeling/util/LaneUtil.js`: This file contains utility functions for managing lanes, including functions that might be used to determine if an element is a lane or an empty pool. Adjustments here could help in correctly identifying empty pools.

- `lib/features/replace/ReplaceOptions.js`: This file might contain options or configurations related to element types, including empty pools. Ensuring that empty pools are correctly identified and handled here could prevent unintended resizing.
