### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that when a BPMN diagram is wrapped in a pool, the diagram unexpectedly jumps out of the current viewport. This disrupts the user's focus and makes it difficult to continue working on the diagram without manually repositioning it.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in how the BPMN diagram's viewport is managed when a pool is added. When wrapping a process in a pool, the diagram's elements are repositioned, and the viewport may not be updated correctly to keep the diagram in view. This could be due to a lack of proper event handling or viewport adjustment logic when the pool is added.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateParticipantBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js
lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
```

- **`lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownCentering.js`**: This file manages the view state of a diagram when drilling down into subprocesses. It might need to be adjusted to ensure the viewport stays centered when wrapping a process in a pool.

- **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/CreateParticipantBehavior.js`**: This file handles the creation and placement of participants (pools). It may need to be modified to ensure that the viewport is updated correctly when a pool is added.

- **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ResizeBehavior.js`**: This file manages the resizing of elements, including participants. It might need to be adjusted to ensure that the viewport is updated correctly when the size of the pool changes.

- **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/ToggleElementCollapseBehaviour.js`**: This file manages the collapse and expansion of elements. It might need to be adjusted to ensure that the viewport is updated correctly when the pool is added and the diagram is repositioned.

- **`lib/util/LabelUtil.js`**: This file handles label positioning and might need to be adjusted to ensure that labels are correctly positioned and the viewport is updated when a pool is added.
