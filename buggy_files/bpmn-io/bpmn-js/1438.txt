### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The problem described is that the names of message elements on message flows are not being rendered in the BPMN diagram. The image provided shows message flows with message icons but no accompanying text labels for the message names.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely lies in the rendering logic for message flows. Specifically, the code responsible for rendering message flows may not be correctly handling or rendering the associated message names. This could be due to a missing or incorrect implementation of label rendering for message flows, or a problem with how the message names are being extracted from the BPMN model and passed to the rendering functions.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the issue, ordered by importance:

```
lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js
lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js
lib/util/LabelUtil.js
lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js
lib/util/DiUtil.js
```

- **`lib/draw/BpmnRenderer.js`**: This file contains the core rendering logic for BPMN elements. If message flow labels are not being rendered, the issue could be in the rendering logic for connections or shapes.
  
- **`lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js`**: This file manages the direct editing of labels for BPMN elements. If message flow labels are not being rendered, there might be an issue with how labels are being managed or updated.

- **`lib/util/LabelUtil.js`**: This file contains utility functions for handling labels in BPMN diagrams. If message flow labels are not being rendered, there might be a problem with how the label positions or properties are being calculated.

- **`lib/features/modeling/BpmnUpdater.js`**: This file manages updates to the BPMN diagram, including updates to connections and labels. If message flow labels are not being rendered, there might be an issue with how the diagram is being updated after changes.

- **`lib/util/DiUtil.js`**: This file contains utility functions for working with the diagram interchange (DI) layer of the BPMN model. If message flow labels are not being rendered, there might be an issue with how the DI layer is being processed or updated.
