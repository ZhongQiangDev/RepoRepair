### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that after pasting a set of elements where the first element is a task, the direct editing mode is automatically activated for the task element. This is unexpected because direct editing should not be activated upon pasting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from the way the BPMN diagram handles the paste operation and the subsequent selection of elements. When pasting elements, the system might be inadvertently triggering the direct editing mode for the first task element due to incorrect event handling or selection logic. This could be related to how the system determines which elements should be selected or focused after a paste operation.
