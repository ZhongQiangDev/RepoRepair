### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the styles defined for `ExampleText1`, `ExampleText2`, and `ExampleText3` are not being applied as expected. Specifically, the colors and border styles are not being overridden correctly when extending the styled components.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to be related to how styled-components are being extended and applied within the `@react-pdf/renderer` context. The problem might stem from:

- **Incorrect Style Resolution**: The styles might not be properly resolving or merging when extending the components.
- **Styled-Components Integration**: There could be an issue with how `@react-pdf/styled-components` integrates with `@react-pdf/renderer`.
- **Style Application**: The styles might not be correctly applied to the `Text` component within the PDF rendering context.
