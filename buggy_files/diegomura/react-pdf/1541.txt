### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the flexbox elements in the PDF do not stretch to fill the full page size as expected. In the provided screenshots, the red box should span the entire height of the page but instead only occupies a small portion.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue likely stems from how the flexbox layout is being interpreted or rendered within the PDF generation process. The flexbox properties may not be correctly applied or supported in the PDF rendering engine, leading to the red box not stretching as intended. This could be due to:

- Incorrect or incomplete implementation of flexbox properties in the PDF rendering logic.
- Missing or incorrect calculations for the height of the flexbox container or its children.
- Issues with how the layout engine handles the `flex-grow` property in the context of PDF generation.
