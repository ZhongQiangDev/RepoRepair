1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue described is that the `Text` component does not correctly handle RGBA colors, leading to unexpected or incorrect color rendering compared to the `View` component.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The problem likely stems from how the `Text` component processes and applies RGBA color values. This could involve issues in color parsing, conversion, or application within the rendering pipeline. The discrepancy between `Text` and `View` suggests a specific handling or omission in the `Text` component's implementation related to RGBA colors.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
packages/render/src/primitives/renderText.js
packages/render/src/primitives/renderSvgText.js
packages/stylesheet/src/colors.js
packages/pdfkit/src/mixins/color.js
packages/layout/src/text/fontSubstitution.js
```

- `packages/render/src/primitives/renderText.js`: This file is directly involved in rendering text on the canvas, including handling color properties. It is likely where the issue with RGBA color application occurs.
- `packages/render/src/primitives/renderSvgText.js`: This file handles SVG text rendering, which may also be relevant if the issue extends to SVG-based text components.
- `packages/stylesheet/src/colors.js`: This file contains functions for transforming and processing color values, which could be involved in the incorrect handling of RGBA colors.
- `packages/pdfkit/src/mixins/color.js`: This file manages color settings for PDF rendering, including RGBA colors, and could be relevant if the issue is related to PDF-specific color handling.
- `packages/layout/src/text/fontSubstitution.js`: While less directly related, this file handles font-related operations that could indirectly affect text rendering and color application.
