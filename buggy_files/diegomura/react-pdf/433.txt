1. **Wrong Behavior**: The issue described is that when setting a border on a rounded `<View>` element, the border does not render correctly as the `borderRadius` increases. Specifically, the border appears distorted and does not conform to the rounded shape of the view, especially as the `borderRadius` approaches the dimensions of the view (making it more circular).

2. **Cause Analysis**: The problem likely stems from how the border is being rendered in relation to the rounded corners. The rendering engine may not be correctly calculating the path for the border when the `borderRadius` is large, leading to the observed distortion. This could be due to incorrect handling of the border path in the rendering logic or issues with how the border is applied to the rounded corners.

3. **Files Related to the Cause**:
```
src/mixins/borders.js
src/elements/View.js
src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js
src/stylesheet/yogaValue.js
src/utils/styles.js
```

- `src/mixins/borders.js`: This file contains functions for drawing borders, including `drawBorders`, which is likely responsible for rendering the border around the `<View>`. It may need adjustments to correctly handle rounded borders.
- `src/elements/View.js`: This file defines the `View` component, which is the element where the border is applied. It may need modifications to ensure that the border is rendered correctly with rounded corners.
- `src/stylesheet/transformStyles.js`: This file processes and transforms style objects, including border-related styles. It might need changes to properly handle the transformation of border styles for rounded views.
- `src/stylesheet/yogaValue.js`: This file converts CSS-like property values into Yoga layout engine constants. It could be relevant if there are issues with how border properties are being interpreted by the layout engine.
- `src/utils/styles.js`: This file contains utility functions for managing styles, which might be involved in the overall style processing that affects border rendering.
