### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The issue described is a `TypeError: value.split is not a function` when using the `flex` keyword in CSS. This suggests that the code is attempting to call the `split` method on a value that is not a string, leading to the error.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The error occurs in the `processFlex` function, which is part of the `expand.js` file. The function is likely expecting a string value but is instead receiving a non-string value (possibly a number or an object). This could be due to incorrect type handling or an issue with how the `flex` property is being passed or processed.
