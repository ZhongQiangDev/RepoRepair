### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The issue described is that the `flexBasis` property is not functioning as expected after upgrading from version 1.6.14 to 2.0.8. In the "Before" image, the text elements "One," "Two," and "Three" are properly spaced according to their specified `flexBasis` values. However, in the "After" image, the text elements are not spaced correctly, and they appear to be compressed together, indicating that the `flexBasis` property is being ignored or not applied properly.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to changes in how the `flexBasis` property is handled or interpreted in the newer version of the library. This could be due to a bug in the new version, a change in the implementation of the `flexBasis` property, or a change in how the layout engine processes flexbox properties.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the provided repository information, the following files are most likely related to the handling of `flexBasis` and the layout engine:

```
packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js
packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js
packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js
packages/layout/src/node/setFlexDirection.js
packages/layout/src/node/setJustifyContent.js
```

- `packages/layout/src/node/setYogaValue.js`: This file is responsible for setting Yoga layout properties, including `flexBasis`, on nodes. It is likely the primary file where the issue lies.
- `packages/layout/src/steps/resolveDimensions.js`: This file handles dimension resolution for nodes, which could be related to how `flexBasis` affects the layout.
- `packages/stylesheet/src/expand.js`: This file processes and expands shorthand CSS properties, including `flexBasis`, which could be relevant if there's an issue with property expansion.
- `packages/layout/src/node/setFlexDirection.js`: This file sets the flex direction on nodes, which could interact with `flexBasis` in unexpected ways.
- `packages/layout/src/node/setJustifyContent.js`: This file sets the justify content property, which could also interact with `flexBasis` in the layout calculations.
