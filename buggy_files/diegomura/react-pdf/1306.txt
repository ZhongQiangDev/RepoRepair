1. **Wrong Behavior Involved:**
The TypeScript error indicates that the `SourceObject` type in the `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` file does not support a function that returns a `Promise<string>`. According to the documentation, the `src` prop should accept a function that returns a string or a promise resolving to a string, but the type definition does not reflect this.

2. **Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior:**
The cause is a mismatch between the documentation and the actual type definition in the code. The `SourceObject` type definition in `@react-pdf/types/image.d.ts` does not include the case where the function can return a `Promise<string>`. This discrepancy leads to the TypeScript error when trying to use a function that returns a promise as the `src` prop.

3. **Files Most Related to the Cause:**
```
packages/types/image.d.ts
packages/layout/src/image/resolve.js
packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js
packages/renderer/src/primitives/renderImage.js
packages/examples/src/text/index.js
```

- `packages/types/image.d.ts`: This file contains the type definition for `SourceObject`, which needs to be updated to include the missing case.
- `packages/layout/src/image/resolve.js`: This file handles the resolution of image sources, so it might need adjustments to handle the new type.
- `packages/layout/src/image/fetchImage.js`: This file deals with fetching images, and it should be compatible with the updated type definition.
- `packages/renderer/src/primitives/renderImage.js`: This file is responsible for rendering images, and it should be aware of the new type.
- `packages/examples/src/text/index.js`: This file contains an example that might need to be updated to reflect the correct usage of the `src` prop.
