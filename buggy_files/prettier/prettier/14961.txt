### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior involves Prettier 2.8.0 adding unnecessary spaces around pipe arguments in Angular pipes. For example, it changes:
`html
{{ (user$ | async).credit | currency:'CAD':'symbol-narrow':'4.2-2' }}
`
to:
`html
{{ (user$ | async).credit | currency : 'CAD' : 'symbol-narrow' : '4.2-2' }}
`
This is not the expected behavior, as the original formatting is preferred for readability and consistency with Angular documentation.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior likely lies in the way Prettier handles Angular pipes and their arguments. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to how Prettier identifies and formats pipe expressions and their arguments. The problem might be due to a change in the parsing or formatting logic for Angular pipes in Prettier 2.8.0, which now incorrectly adds spaces around pipe arguments.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/language-js/print/angular.js
src/language-js/embed/angular-interpolation.js
src/language-js/embed/utils.js
src/language-js/print/binaryish.js
src/language-js/print/misc.js
```

- `src/language-js/print/angular.js`: This file contains functions for formatting Angular-specific syntax nodes, including pipes. It is likely where the formatting logic for Angular pipes is defined.
- `src/language-js/embed/angular-interpolation.js`: This file processes Angular interpolation expressions, which may include pipe expressions. It could be involved in how Prettier handles the formatting of these expressions.
- `src/language-js/embed/utils.js`: This file contains utility functions for formatting embedded content, including Angular-specific formatting rules. It may contain logic related to the spacing around pipe arguments.
- `src/language-js/print/binaryish.js`: This file handles binary-like expressions, which might include pipe expressions. It could be involved in the general formatting of expressions that include operators like pipes.
- `src/language-js/print/misc.js`: This file contains various utility functions for printing different types of nodes. It might include general formatting rules that could affect how pipe arguments are spaced.
