### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when a file contains only a directive (`'use strict';`) followed by a new line and then a comment (`// comment`), Prettier ends the file with two newlines instead of one. The expected behavior is to end the file with a single newline.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prettier handles trailing whitespace and newlines when processing directives and comments. Specifically, the problem might be related to how Prettier determines the final newline count after formatting the file. The parser or the formatting logic might be adding an extra newline due to the presence of the comment after the directive.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/main/core.js
src/main/ast-to-doc.js
src/main/comments.js
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
src/utils/line-column-to-index.js
```

- `src/main/core.js`: This file contains the core formatting logic, including `format` and `formatRange`, which handle the overall formatting process and could be responsible for the final newline count.
- `src/main/ast-to-doc.js`: This file converts the AST to a document structure, which might influence how newlines are added during the formatting process.
- `src/main/comments.js`: This file handles comment attachment and formatting, which could be relevant if the comment is causing the extra newline.
- `src/language-js/printer-estree.js`: This file contains the printer for JavaScript code, which might have specific rules for handling directives and comments.
- `src/utils/line-column-to-index.js`: This utility might be involved in calculating positions within the file, which could indirectly affect newline handling.
