### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves Prettier removing empty lines within the `blogs` section of a Markdown YAML frontmatter. Specifically, the empty line between the two blog entries is being removed during the formatting process, which is not the expected behavior.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prettier handles empty lines within YAML frontmatter. Prettier may be interpreting the empty lines as unnecessary whitespace and removing them during the formatting process. This could be due to the way Prettier's YAML parser or its Markdown printer is configured to handle such cases. The problem might also be related to how Prettier determines whether a line is significant or not, particularly within structured data like YAML frontmatter.

src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
src/language-markdown/utils.js
src/main/core.js
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/language-markdown/clean.js`**: This file contains the `clean` function, which processes and sanitizes nodes within a Markdown AST. It might be responsible for removing unnecessary properties or whitespace, including empty lines in YAML frontmatter.

- **`src/language-markdown/print-preprocess.js`**: This file includes the `preprocess` function, which applies a series of transformations to the AST. One of these transformations might be affecting the handling of empty lines within YAML frontmatter.

- **`src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js`**: This file contains the `genericPrint` function, which is responsible for formatting various Markdown nodes into a structured `Doc` format. It might be where the decision to remove empty lines is made during the formatting process.

- **`src/language-markdown/utils.js`**: This file contains utility functions that might be used in the processing and formatting of Markdown content. Functions like `isPrettierIgnore` or `splitText` could influence how empty lines are handled.

- **`src/main/core.js`**: This file contains core functions like `coreFormat`, which orchestrates the formatting process. It might contain logic that affects how empty lines are treated across different parts of the document, including YAML frontmatter.
