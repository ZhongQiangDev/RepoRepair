1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The wrong behavior is that Prettier fails to detect the language of a fenced code block when there are non-whitespace characters (attributes) following the language identifier. Specifically, it does not format the code block with attributes the same way it formats a plain code block.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The issue likely stems from how Prettier parses and identifies the language of a fenced code block. When attributes are present after the language identifier, Prettier may not correctly recognize the language, leading to improper formatting. This suggests a problem in the parsing logic that handles fenced code blocks.

```

- `src/language-markdown/embed.js`: This file handles the embedding of code blocks within Markdown, including the detection of the language and attributes. It is likely where the issue originates.
- `src/main/parser.js`: This file is responsible for initializing and resolving parsers, which could affect how the language is detected in code blocks.
- `src/main/options.js`: This file normalizes and infers options, which might influence how attributes in code blocks are handled.
- `src/main/ast-to-doc.js`: This file converts an AST into a formatted document, and any issues with language detection could affect this conversion.
- `src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js`: This file contains the parser for Markdown, which includes handling fenced code blocks and their attributes.
