### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior described is that the JSX formatting is inconsistent when using the `\u3000` (ideographic space) character. Specifically, the formatting changes between runs, leading to an unstable output. The first run adds an extra space before the second `<span />`, while the second run removes it.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to be related to how Prettier handles the `\u3000` character in JSX. The inconsistency suggests a problem with how Prettier processes or recognizes this specific Unicode character in the context of JSX formatting. It may be treating the `\u3000` character differently across multiple formatting passes, leading to the unstable output.

```
src/language-js/printer-estree.js
src/language-js/utils.js
src/main/core.js
src/main/ast-to-doc.js
src/language-js/embed.js
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/language-js/printer-estree.js`**: This file contains the core logic for printing JavaScript/TypeScript AST nodes, including JSX. The issue likely lies in how it handles special characters like `\u3000` during the printing process.

- **`src/language-js/utils.js`**: This file includes utility functions that might be involved in processing and formatting JSX nodes. It could contain logic related to handling special characters or whitespace.

- **`src/main/core.js`**: This file contains the main formatting logic, including `formatAST` and `formatRange`, which are responsible for the overall formatting process. The issue might be related to how these functions handle special characters.

- **`src/main/ast-to-doc.js`**: This file converts an AST to a document structure, which is then formatted. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how the AST is converted to a document before formatting.

- **`src/language-js/embed.js`**: This file handles embedded content within JavaScript/TypeScript, including JSX. It might contain logic for handling special characters within embedded content.
