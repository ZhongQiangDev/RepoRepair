### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Prettier is generating excessively long lines when normalizing markdown tables, particularly when the table contains HTML content. This results in lines that exceed a reasonable length (e.g., 865 characters), making the markdown less readable and potentially causing issues with rendering or display.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this behavior is likely related to how Prettier handles markdown table normalization. Specifically, when Prettier encounters a markdown table with HTML content, it attempts to normalize the table by aligning the columns with a consistent number of dashes. However, if the content within the table cells is very long (e.g., due to HTML content), this can result in excessively long lines. The current implementation does not have a mechanism to detect and handle such cases, leading to the observed issue.

```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/main/parser.js`**: This file is responsible for parsing the input text and generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It is crucial because the issue likely stems from how the parser handles markdown tables with HTML content. Adjustments here could ensure that the parser recognizes excessively long lines and handles them appropriately.

- **`src/main/options.js`**: This file contains the logic for inferring and normalizing parsers and options. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how Prettier is configured to handle markdown tables. Ensuring that the correct parser and options are applied could help mitigate the problem.

- **`src/main/options-normalizer.js`**: This file normalizes and validates options, which could be relevant if the issue is related to configuration settings that control line length or table formatting. Ensuring that options are correctly normalized could help prevent excessively long lines.

- **`src/main/multiparser.js`**: This file contains utility functions for processing and formatting text, including embedded content. It might be relevant if the issue is related to how Prettier handles embedded HTML content within markdown tables. Adjustments here could ensure that embedded content is handled in a way that prevents excessively long lines.

- **`src/main/comments.js`**: This file contains utility functions for processing and formatting comments. While the issue is primarily related to markdown tables, comments within the table cells could contribute to the problem. Ensuring that comments are handled correctly could help prevent excessively long lines.
