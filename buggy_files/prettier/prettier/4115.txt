### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in GitHub Problem Description

The wrong behavior described is that when a user attempts to nest an HTML table within a Markdown list item, the `format on save` feature in Prettier continuously adds more indentation each time the file is saved. This results in the HTML table being pushed further out of sync with the Markdown list item, breaking the intended formatting.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue appears to stem from how Prettier handles indentation within nested Markdown and HTML structures. Specifically, Prettier may be misinterpreting the indentation levels or failing to recognize the correct nesting context when formatting the HTML within the Markdown list. This could be due to a combination of factors:

- **Incorrect Indentation Detection**: Prettier might not be correctly identifying the starting indentation level of the Markdown list item, causing it to apply additional indentation each time.
- **HTML Nesting within Markdown**: There might be a bug in how Prettier processes HTML tags nested within Markdown, leading to inconsistent indentation rules being applied.
- **Format on Save Behavior**: The continuous application of indentation on each save suggests a loop or recursive behavior where Prettier keeps adding indentation without recognizing the correct formatting.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

Based on the analysis, the following files are most likely related to the cause of the issue:

```
src/main/options.js
src/main/ast-to-doc.js
src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js
src/doc/doc-utils.js
src/doc/doc-printer.js
```

**Explanation:**

- **`src/main/options.js`**: This file handles the normalization and inference of parser options. The issue might be related to how options are set for handling nested HTML within Markdown.
  
- **`src/main/ast-to-doc.js`**: This file converts an AST into a formatted document. The problem could be in how it processes nested structures, particularly when converting Markdown with embedded HTML.

- **`src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js`**: This file contains functions for formatting Markdown nodes. The issue might be in how it handles indentation and nesting of HTML within Markdown.

- **`src/doc/doc-utils.js`**: This file provides utility functions for document processing, including indentation and alignment. The problem might be in how these utilities handle nested structures.

- **`src/doc/doc-printer.js`**: This file contains functions for managing indentation, alignment, and document formatting. The issue might be in how these functions handle nested structures and indentation levels.
