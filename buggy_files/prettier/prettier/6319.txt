1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the Prettier tool is not correctly handling the "minimal" pipeline proposal as expected. Instead of applying the minimal pipeline proposal, it seems to be applying the smart pipeline proposal, which is not the desired behavior.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The issue likely stems from the configuration or implementation of the pipeline proposal within Prettier. The `proposal` option is supposed to be set to "minimal" to use the minimal pipeline proposal, but it appears that the implementation is defaulting to or incorrectly applying the "smart" proposal instead. This could be due to a misconfiguration, a bug in the implementation of the pipeline proposal, or an incorrect handling of the configuration option.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   src/main/options.js
   src/main/parser.js
   src/main/options-normalizer.js
   src/main/ast-to-doc.js
   src/main/support.js
   ```

   - `src/main/options.js`: This file likely handles the configuration options, including the `proposal` option, and ensures that the correct pipeline proposal is applied.
   - `src/main/parser.js`: This file is responsible for parsing the input code and could be where the pipeline proposal is applied based on the configuration.
   - `src/main/options-normalizer.js`: This file normalizes and validates the options, ensuring that the `proposal` option is correctly set and handled.
   - `src/main/ast-to-doc.js`: This file converts the AST to a printable document, which might be affected by the pipeline proposal implementation.
   - `src/main/support.js`: This file provides support information, which might include details about the supported pipeline proposals.
