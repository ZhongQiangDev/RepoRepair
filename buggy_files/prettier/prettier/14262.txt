### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Prettier is removing the parentheses around the object literal when it is used with a JSDoc `@satisfies` tag. This causes issues with TypeScript type checking and intellisense, as the type assertion is no longer correctly applied.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because Prettier is not recognizing the `@satisfies` JSDoc tag as a context where parentheses should be preserved. Prettier's current logic for removing unnecessary parentheses is interfering with the intended use of the `@satisfies` tag, which requires the parentheses to maintain the type assertion.

src/main/core.js
src/main/ast-to-doc.js
src/language-js/embed.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `src/language-js/needs-parens.js`: This file contains the logic for determining whether parentheses are necessary around expressions. Adjustments here could ensure that parentheses are preserved when used with `@satisfies`.
- `src/language-js/printer-estree.js`: This file handles the printing of AST nodes. Changes here could ensure that the printer respects the need for parentheses in specific contexts like `@satisfies`.
- `src/main/core.js`: This file contains core formatting functions. It may need adjustments to ensure that the core formatting logic respects the specific requirements of JSDoc tags.
- `src/main/ast-to-doc.js`: This file converts AST nodes to a printable document. Ensuring that it correctly handles the `@satisfies` tag could prevent the removal of necessary parentheses.
- `src/language-js/embed.js`: This file handles embedded content, including JSDoc comments. It may need modifications to ensure that JSDoc tags like `@satisfies` are correctly processed.
