### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that Prettier is removing the trailing comma in the generic type parameter list of `.mts` files, which is required by the TypeScript compiler for `.mts` and `.cts` files. This results in a TypeScript error (ts(7060)) indicating that a trailing comma is necessary.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely related to how Prettier handles trailing commas in generic type parameter lists. Specifically, Prettier's `trailingComma` option is set to `all`, which should normally preserve trailing commas. However, it seems that Prettier is not correctly recognizing the requirement for trailing commas in `.mts` files, leading to their removal during formatting.

src/language-js/printer-estree.js
```

**Explanation:**

- `src/language-js/print/type-parameters.js`: This file is directly responsible for formatting type parameters, including handling trailing commas. It is likely where the issue lies, as it needs to be aware of the specific requirements for `.mts` files.
  
- `src/language-js/parse/typescript.js`: This file handles the parsing of TypeScript code. It may need to be updated to correctly identify and preserve the necessary trailing commas in `.mts` files.

- `src/language-js/utils/index.js`: This file contains various utility functions for working with AST nodes. It might have functions that influence how type parameters are processed and formatted.

- `src/main/range-util.js`: This file contains utilities for working with ranges in the AST, which could be relevant for ensuring that the correct parts of the code are formatted appropriately.

- `src/language-js/printer-estree.js`: This file contains general printing functions for ESTree nodes. It might need adjustments to ensure that the printer respects the specific formatting requirements for `.mts` files.
