### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that the `default` case in the `switch` statement is not preserving the comment as expected. Specifically, the comment `// expression;` is being moved to the next line after the `default` keyword, instead of staying on the same line.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how Prettier handles comments in `switch` statements. Specifically, the comment placement logic might not be correctly identifying that the comment should stay on the same line as the `default` keyword. This could be due to how Prettier's comment attachment logic is implemented, particularly for `switch` statements.
