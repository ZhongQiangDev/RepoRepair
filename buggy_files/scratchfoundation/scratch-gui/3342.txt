1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The issue is that the selected sprite or backdrop watermark is missing from the blocks workspace. The desired behavior is to have a watermark of the selected sprite or backdrop displayed in the top-right corner of the blocks workspace, with a max size of 48px by 48px, right-aligned to the zoom controls, and with 35% opacity.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of the necessary code to render the watermark in the blocks workspace. This could be due to missing CSS styles, missing logic to determine the selected sprite or backdrop, or missing rendering logic in the relevant React components.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx
src/components/sprite-selector/sprite-selector.jsx
src/components/stage-selector/stage-selector.jsx
src/components/asset-panel/asset-panel.jsx
src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx
```

- `src/components/blocks/blocks.jsx`: This file is directly related to the blocks workspace, so it is likely where the watermark rendering logic needs to be added.
- `src/components/sprite-selector/sprite-selector.jsx`: This file manages sprite selection, which is necessary to determine which sprite's watermark should be displayed.
- `src/components/stage-selector/stage-selector.jsx`: This file manages stage selection, which is necessary to determine which backdrop's watermark should be displayed.
- `src/components/asset-panel/asset-panel.jsx`: This file contains the `AssetPanel` component, which might be involved in displaying the selected sprite or backdrop.
- `src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx`: This file contains the `Selector` component, which might be involved in displaying the selected sprite or backdrop.
