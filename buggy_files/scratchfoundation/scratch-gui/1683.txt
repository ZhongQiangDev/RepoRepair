1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The problem description indicates that the navigation bar needs to be designed and integrated into the GUI. The current issue is that the navigation bar is not yet implemented or integrated, even though it is a critical part of the user interface.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to the absence of a dedicated component for the navigation bar and the lack of integration with the existing GUI components. The current components in the repository do not seem to include a navigation bar, and the `GUIComponent` does not mention a navigation bar in its layout.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/components/menu-bar/menu-bar.jsx
src/components/gui/gui.jsx
src/containers/gui.jsx
src/components/stage-header/stage-header.jsx
src/components/controls/controls.jsx
```

**Explanation:**
- `src/components/menu-bar/menu-bar.jsx`: This file is the most relevant as it already contains a `MenuBar` component, which can be adapted or extended to serve as the navigation bar.
- `src/components/gui/gui.jsx`: This file defines the `GUIComponent`, which is the main interface. Integrating the navigation bar into this component would be essential.
- `src/containers/gui.jsx`: This file connects the `GUI` component to the Redux store and manages the overall GUI state. It would need to be updated to include the navigation bar state.
- `src/components/stage-header/stage-header.jsx`: This component manages the stage header, which is part of the top-level UI. The navigation bar might be integrated alongside or within this component.
- `src/components/controls/controls.jsx`: This file contains the `Controls` component, which includes interactive buttons. The navigation bar might include similar interactive elements, so this file could provide useful patterns for implementation.
