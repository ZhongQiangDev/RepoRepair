1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that slider monitors created in Scratch 3.0 are fixed to a range of 0-100, whereas in Scratch 2.0, the min and max values can be customized via a context menu. This prevents users from setting custom ranges for sliders in Scratch 3.0.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The cause is likely related to how the slider monitors are initialized and managed in Scratch 3.0. The code responsible for creating and rendering the slider monitors may not be properly handling the customization of min and max values, unlike in Scratch 2.0. This could involve missing logic for importing custom ranges or a hardcoded default range.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/components/monitor/monitor.jsx
src/containers/monitor.jsx
src/reducers/monitor-layout.js
src/components/monitor-list/monitor-list.jsx
src/lib/monitor-adapter.js
```

- `src/components/monitor/monitor.jsx`: This file is directly responsible for rendering the monitor components, including sliders. It likely contains the logic for handling the min and max values of the slider.
- `src/containers/monitor.jsx`: This file connects the monitor component to the Redux store and handles the state management of monitors. It may contain the logic for setting up the initial range values.
- `src/reducers/monitor-layout.js`: This file manages the state of monitor rectangles, including their positions and dimensions. It might include logic for storing and updating the min and max values of sliders.
- `src/components/monitor-list/monitor-list.jsx`: This file manages a list of monitors and their rendering. It could be involved in the initialization and rendering of slider monitors.
- `src/lib/monitor-adapter.js`: This file contains utility functions for generating monitor objects. It might include logic for processing and formatting the min and max values for slider monitors.
