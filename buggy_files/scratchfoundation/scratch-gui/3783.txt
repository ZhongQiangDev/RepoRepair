### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The GitHub Problem Description indicates that the `scratch-blocks` devDependency has been updated from `0.1.0-prerelease.1542223417` to `0.1.0-prerelease.1542293672`. The issue is that this new version is not covered by the current version range in the project's configuration, which means the project will not automatically use the latest version unless the version range is updated.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The cause of the issue is that the project's configuration file (likely `package.json`) specifies a version range for `scratch-blocks` that does not include the latest version `0.1.0-prerelease.1542293672`. This means that even though the new version is available, the project will continue to use the older version unless the version range is updated to include the new version.

### Step 3: Find Related Files
To fix this issue, the following files are most relevant:

```
package.json
```
This file contains the project's dependencies and their version ranges. It needs to be updated to include the new version of `scratch-blocks`.

```
src/lib/blocks.js
```
This file acts as an intermediary between ScratchBlocks and the Scratch VM. It may need to be updated if the new version of `scratch-blocks` introduces changes that affect this integration.

```
src/containers/blocks.jsx
```
This file manages the Blockly workspace and its interactions with the Scratch VM. It may need adjustments if the new version of `scratch-blocks` changes the way blocks are handled.

```
src/lib/make-toolbox-xml.js
```
This file generates XML for Blockly toolbox categories. It might need updates if the new version of `scratch-blocks` changes the structure or behavior of the blocks.

```
webpack.config.js
```
This file configures the build process. While less likely, it might need adjustments if the new version of `scratch-blocks` requires specific build configurations.
