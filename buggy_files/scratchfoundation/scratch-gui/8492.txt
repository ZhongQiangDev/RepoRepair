### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior is that when the user drags the mouse outside the modal while adjusting the sound selection handles, the modal unexpectedly closes, causing the user to lose their work.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from the modal's event handling mechanism. When the user drags the selection handles, the mouse moves outside the modal, triggering an event that closes the modal. This could be due to a misconfigured event listener or a lack of proper event propagation handling. The modal might be set to close on any click or drag event outside its boundaries, without considering whether the user is actively interacting with the selection handles.

```

**Explanation:**

- `src/components/record-modal/record-modal.jsx`: This file is directly responsible for rendering the modal that contains the sound recording interface. It likely contains the event handling logic that determines when the modal should close.
  
- `src/components/audio-trimmer/audio-trimmer.jsx`: This component is responsible for the audio trimming functionality, including the selection handles. It might be responsible for managing the drag events and ensuring they don't interfere with the modal's close behavior.
  
- `src/components/audio-selector/audio-selector.jsx`: This component is involved in the audio selection interface and might be related to the drag-and-drop functionality. It could be interacting with the modal's event handling in a way that causes the issue.
  
- `src/components/modal/modal.jsx`: This file defines the generic modal component used throughout the application. It might contain the base logic for closing the modal on outside clicks or drags, which could be affecting the sound recording modal.
  
- `src/containers/record-modal.jsx`: This file connects the `RecordModal` component to the Redux store and might contain additional event handling or state management logic that affects the modal's behavior.
