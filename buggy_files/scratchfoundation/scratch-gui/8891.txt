### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior
The wrong behavior described in the GitHub problem is that the setting switches, which use colored icons to indicate active and inactive states, are not colorblind-friendly. Specifically, when viewed in grayscale, the active and inactive states become indistinguishable, making it difficult for colorblind users to determine which option is selected.

### 2. Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is the reliance on color alone to differentiate between the active and inactive states of the setting switches. The current implementation uses a colored background for the active state and a grayed-out appearance for the inactive state. This approach fails to provide sufficient contrast for colorblind users, particularly those with protanopia, deuteranopia, or other forms of red-green color blindness.

### 3. Identify Related Files
To fix this issue, we need to modify the styling of the setting switches to use additional visual cues, such as background color changes, borders, or text labels, to indicate the active state. The most relevant files are likely those that define the styling and behavior of the setting switches.

Here are the top 5 files most related to the cause, ordered by importance:

```
src/components/direction-picker/direction-picker.jsx
src/components/button/button.jsx
src/components/controls/controls.jsx
src/components/context-menu/context-menu.jsx
src/components/icon-button/icon-button.jsx
```

- `src/components/direction-picker/direction-picker.jsx`: This file contains the `DirectionPicker` component, which includes the setting switches for rotation styles. It is the most relevant file as it directly involves the problematic switches.
- `src/components/button/button.jsx`: This file defines the `ButtonComponent`, which might be used for the setting switches. Adjusting the button styles here could help make the switches more colorblind-friendly.
- `src/components/controls/controls.jsx`: This file contains the `Controls` component, which might include the setting switches. It could be relevant if the switches are part of the controls.
- `src/components/context-menu/context-menu.jsx`: This file defines various menu items, including `StyledMenuItem`, `BorderedMenuItem`, and `DangerousMenuItem`. If the setting switches are part of a context menu, this file might be relevant.
- `src/components/icon-button/icon-button.jsx`: This file defines the `IconButton` component, which might be used for the icons in the setting switches. Adjusting the icon styles here could help improve the switches' visibility.
