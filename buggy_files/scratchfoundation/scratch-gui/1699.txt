1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that when a user clicks the add sprite/costume/backdrop button on an iPad, the sprite library opens with the search bar focused, causing the keyboard to pop up. This keyboard takes up a significant portion of the screen, making it difficult for users to see the sprites.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely related to the automatic focusing of the search bar within the sprite library modal when it is opened. This focus event triggers the keyboard on touch devices like iPads. The issue might be in the code that handles the modal opening or the search bar's focus behavior.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**

```
src/components/library/library.jsx
src/components/modal/modal.jsx
src/components/filter/filter.jsx
src/components/asset-panel/asset-panel.jsx
src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx
```

- `src/components/library/library.jsx`: This file contains the `LibraryComponent`, which manages the library modal and its content. It likely includes the logic for opening the modal and rendering the search bar.
- `src/components/modal/modal.jsx`: This file defines the `ModalComponent`, which is used to render modals. It might contain the logic for focusing elements when the modal is opened.
- `src/components/filter/filter.jsx`: This file contains the `FilterComponent`, which is likely used for the search bar within the library modal. It might handle the focus event for the search bar.
- `src/components/asset-panel/asset-panel.jsx`: This file contains the `AssetPanel` component, which might be used within the library modal and could influence the focus behavior.
- `src/components/asset-panel/selector.jsx`: This file contains the `Selector` component, which might be part of the library modal and could also influence the focus behavior.
