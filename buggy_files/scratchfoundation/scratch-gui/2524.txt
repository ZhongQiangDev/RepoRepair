### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the project using an outdated version of the `scratch-paint` dependency (`0.2.0-prerelease.20180621213404`) instead of the latest version (`0.2.0-prerelease.20180626185754`). This discrepancy means the project is missing out on the latest features, fixes, and improvements included in the newer version.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The cause of this issue is likely due to the version range specified in the project's `package.json` file. The current version range does not include the latest version of `scratch-paint`, preventing the project from automatically updating to the newer version. This could be due to a specific version pinning, a range that is too restrictive, or a lack of a version range that allows for updates.

### 3. Find Up to 5 Files Most Related to the Cause

The files most related to this issue are those that manage dependencies and configurations for the project. Here are the top 5 files, ordered by importance:

```
package.json
```
```
webpack.config.js
```
```
src/containers/paint-editor-wrapper.jsx
```
```
src/lib/storage.js
```
```
src/reducers/vm.js
```

### Explanation:

- **`package.json`**: This file is the most critical as it specifies the version of `scratch-paint` that the project depends on. Updating the version range here will allow the project to use the latest version.
  
- **`webpack.config.js`**: This file may contain configurations related to the build process that could be affected by the updated `scratch-paint` version. Ensuring that the build configuration is compatible with the new version is important.

- **`src/containers/paint-editor-wrapper.jsx`**: This file likely integrates the `scratch-paint` functionality into the application. It may need adjustments to work with the new version of `scratch-paint`.

- **`src/lib/storage.js`**: This file manages storage and could be impacted if the new version of `scratch-paint` changes how assets or projects are stored or retrieved.

- **`src/reducers/vm.js`**: This file manages the virtual machine state, which could be affected if the new version of `scratch-paint` introduces changes that interact with the VM.
