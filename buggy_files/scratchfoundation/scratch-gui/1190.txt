### Step 1: Identify the Wrong Behavior
The GitHub Problem Description indicates that the project is using an outdated version of the `scratch-vm` dependency (`0.1.0-prerelease.1513627112-prerelease.1513627124`). The latest version (`0.1.0-prerelease.1513710334-prerelease.1513710351`) includes several updates and fixes that are not currently being utilized by the project.

### Step 2: Analyze the Cause
The cause of this issue is that the `package.json` file in the project is not configured to use the latest version of `scratch-vm`. The version range specified in `package.json` does not include the latest version, which means the project will continue to use the outdated version unless the version range is updated.

### Step 3: Identify Related Files
To fix this issue, the following files need to be updated:

```
package.json
```

This file is the most important as it contains the dependency version information. Updating the `scratch-vm` version range here will ensure the project uses the latest version.

```
src/containers/blocks.jsx
```

This file integrates the Scratch Blocks workspace with the Scratch VM and UI. It may need adjustments if the new version of `scratch-vm` introduces changes that affect the workspace or UI.

```
src/lib/blocks.js
```

This file configures and initializes ScratchBlocks with dynamic dropdown menus for various Scratch block types. It may need updates to align with any changes in the new version of `scratch-vm`.

```
src/reducers/vm.js
```

This file contains the action creator and reducer for managing the virtual machine state. It may need modifications if the new version of `scratch-vm` changes the structure or behavior of the virtual machine.

```
src/lib/vm-listener-hoc.jsx
```

This file provides a higher-order component for listening to VM events and integrating with Redux. It may need adjustments if the new version of `scratch-vm` alters the event handling or state management.

These files are ordered by their importance in ensuring the project is compatible with the latest version of `scratch-vm`.
