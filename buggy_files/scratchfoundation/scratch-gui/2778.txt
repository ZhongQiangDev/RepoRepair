1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the project is using an outdated version of the `autoprefixer` dependency (version 8.6.5), while the latest version (9.0.0) has been released. This means the project is missing out on new features, fixes, and performance improvements included in the latest version.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is that the `autoprefixer` version specified in the project's `package.json` file is not set to a version range that includes the latest version (9.0.0). This could be due to the version being pinned to a specific version (8.6.5) or the version range not being updated to include the latest version.

3. **Find up to 5 files most related to the cause from `Repository Information`:**
   ```
   webpack.config.js
   package.json
   src/containers/gui.jsx
   src/lib/app-state-hoc.jsx
   src/lib/vm-listener-hoc.jsx
   ```

   - `webpack.config.js`: This file likely contains the configuration for the build process, including the PostCSS plugins and their versions. Updating the `autoprefixer` version here ensures that the build process uses the latest version.
   - `package.json`: This file specifies the project's dependencies and their versions. Updating the `autoprefixer` version range here ensures that the latest version is installed when running `npm install`.
   - `src/containers/gui.jsx`: This file might include references to the `autoprefixer` configuration or related styles, so it could be impacted by the version update.
   - `src/lib/app-state-hoc.jsx`: This file might include higher-order components that use styles or CSS processing, which could be affected by the `autoprefixer` update.
   - `src/lib/vm-listener-hoc.jsx`: This file might include components that interact with the virtual machine and could be indirectly affected by changes in the CSS processing due to the `autoprefixer` update.
