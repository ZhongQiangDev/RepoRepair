1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   - The issue is that when a sprite is dragged to another space, the duplicate menu does not appear, and instead, the OS's context menu is shown.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   - The problem likely stems from the way the context menu is triggered and managed during drag-and-drop operations. When a sprite is dragged, the system might be interpreting the drag action as a right-click, causing the OS's context menu to appear instead of the application's duplicate menu.
   - This could be due to event handling issues where the drag event is not properly preventing the default right-click behavior or the context menu is not being correctly attached to the sprite during the drag operation.

- `src/components/sprite-selector-item/sprite-selector-item.jsx`: This file likely contains the logic for rendering individual sprite items and handling their context menus. It may need adjustments to ensure the correct menu is shown during drag operations.
- `src/components/context-menu/context-menu.jsx`: This file defines the context menu components, which might need modifications to ensure they are correctly triggered during drag operations.
- `src/components/sprite-selector/sprite-selector.jsx`: This file manages the overall sprite selection interface and might need changes to coordinate with the drag-and-drop functionality.
- `src/lib/drag-recognizer.js`: This utility handles drag and scroll interactions, and might need adjustments to prevent the OS's context menu from appearing during drag operations.
- `src/containers/sprite-selector-item.jsx`: This file connects the sprite selector item component with Redux, and might need changes to ensure the correct state is managed during drag operations.
