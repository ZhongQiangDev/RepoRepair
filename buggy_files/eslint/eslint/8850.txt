1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior involves incorrect indentation levels in the code. Specifically, the lines 6, 7, and 8 have more spaces than expected according to the `indent` rule. Line 6 and 7 have 20 spaces instead of the expected 16, and line 8 has 16 spaces instead of the expected 12.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause is likely due to a mismatch between the configured indentation level in the ESLint rule and the actual indentation used in the code. The `indent` rule is configured to expect a certain number of spaces for indentation, but the code does not adhere to this configuration. This could be due to manual indentation errors, incorrect auto-formatting settings, or a misunderstanding of the expected indentation levels.
