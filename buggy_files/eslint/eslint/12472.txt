### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `key-spacing` rule with the `multiLine` option set to `{"align": "value"}` causing unexpected alignment of object properties within JSX expressions. This results in inconsistent and visually unappealing formatting of inline styles and other object literals used in JSX.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue arises because the `key-spacing` rule is applying alignment rules to object literals within JSX expressions, which may not be desirable in all cases. The rule is designed to align values in multi-line object literals, but when applied to inline styles or other objects within JSX, it can lead to formatting that is difficult to read and maintain. The rule does not distinguish between regular object literals and those used in JSX contexts, leading to the observed behavior.

- `lib/rules/key-spacing.js`: This file contains the implementation of the `key-spacing` rule, which is directly responsible for the alignment behavior causing the issue.
- `lib/rules/object-curly-spacing.js`: This file handles spacing rules within curly braces, which may interact with the `key-spacing` rule when formatting object literals.
- `lib/rules/object-property-newline.js`: This file enforces newline rules for object properties, which could be relevant when dealing with multi-line object literals in JSX.
- `lib/rules/jsx-quotes.js`: This file manages quote rules in JSX, which might be indirectly related to the formatting of JSX expressions.
- `lib/rules/indent.js`: This file handles indentation rules, which can affect the overall formatting of JSX expressions and object literals within them.
