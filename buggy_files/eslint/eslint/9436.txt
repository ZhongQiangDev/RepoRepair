1. **Identify the wrong behavior involved in `GitHub Problem Description`:**
   The wrong behavior is that the `no-constant-condition` rule is reporting an error for a ternary expression (`true ? 1 : 0`) that does not involve a constant condition. The rule is incorrectly flagging this ternary expression as if it were a constant condition, which it is not.

2. **Analyze the cause behind the wrong behavior:**
   The cause of this issue likely lies in how the `no-constant-condition` rule is analyzing ternary expressions. The rule might be incorrectly identifying the ternary expression as a constant condition because it is evaluating the condition (`true`) as a constant value. This misinterpretation could be due to the rule not properly distinguishing between a constant condition in an `if` statement and a ternary expression that uses a constant value as its condition.

   - `lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js`: This is the primary file responsible for implementing the `no-constant-condition` rule. It contains the logic that is likely causing the incorrect flagging of the ternary expression.
   - `lib/rules/no-unexpected-multiline.js`: This file might be relevant if the issue involves multiline expressions or statements that could be misinterpreted by the `no-constant-condition` rule.
   - `lib/rules/no-useless-concat.js`: This file could be relevant if the issue involves string concatenation or similar operations that might be misinterpreted as constant conditions.
   - `lib/rules/no-useless-escape.js`: This file might be relevant if the issue involves escape sequences that could be misinterpreted as constant conditions.
   - `lib/rules/no-useless-return.js`: This file could be relevant if the issue involves return statements that might be misinterpreted as constant conditions.
