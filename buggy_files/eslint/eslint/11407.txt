### 1. Identify the Wrong Behavior Involved in `GitHub Problem Description`

The wrong behavior involves the `implicit-arrow-linebreak` autofixer sometimes adding extra characters (e.g., `|`) when it should not. This results in broken code after the autofix is applied.

### 2. Analyze the Cause Behind the Wrong Behavior

The issue likely stems from how the `implicit-arrow-linebreak` rule handles the insertion of line breaks and the surrounding context of the arrow function. Specifically, the problem could be related to:
- Incorrect detection of the need for a line break.
- Misplacement of the line break, leading to unintended characters being included.
- Inadequate handling of comments or other tokens that should not be modified.

lib/util/source-code.js
lib/util/rule-fixer.js
lib/rules/semi.js
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`lib/rules/implicit-arrow-linebreak.js`**: This is the primary file defining the rule that is causing the issue. It contains the logic for detecting and fixing the implicit arrow line break problem.
2. **`lib/util/fix-tracker.js`**: This file manages the tracking and application of fixes, ensuring that changes do not overlap or conflict. It might be involved if the issue is related to how fixes are applied in sequence.
3. **`lib/util/source-code.js`**: This file provides utilities for interacting with the source code, including token and comment handling. Issues with token boundaries or comment preservation could be relevant here.
4. **`lib/util/rule-fixer.js`**: This file contains utilities for generating and applying fix commands. If the issue involves incorrect fix commands or their application, this file would be relevant.
5. **`lib/rules/semi.js`**: This file handles semicolon insertion and spacing, which could be related if the issue involves incorrect handling of semicolons or line breaks in conjunction with the arrow function.
